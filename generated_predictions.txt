i review arguments against the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics that attributes physical reality to a process involving the collapse of a state vector. i discuss the problems that arise in this context, focussing on the class of transactions that cramer attributes to the state of a particle emitted at a specific time and to a particular solution of the schrdinger equation. i then argue that such a transaction represents, in its simplest form, a quantum transaction not as a quantum measurement, but as an example of a quantum - mechanical interaction. in particular, i analyze a transaction occurring between two particles, one emitted at one time and one at a later time, based on the theory of wheeler and feynman. the offer and confirmation waves must adapt to the requirement that the four - dimensional process be consistent with the available experimental protocol. i characterize the offer waves returning to the emitter with amplitude proportional to the amplitude of the third wave, and argue that they represent the complete transaction being completed. however, in practice, the transaction is never completed. i also discuss the conditions under which a transaction may be considered a transaction. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) = cmssbx10 = cmr10 = cmbx10 scaled 2 to 0pt#1@xmath0 submitted to _ the astrophysical journal _ # 1, issue of j. of _ current issues _, f. gravitasyonov, v. kafesaki, a. iskhakov, y. kadachi, s. kivshar, m. kauffmann, and g. v. madden, ` ` ` can one hear the shape of a drum?

we present a new sample of starburst galaxies selected from the pico dos dias survey, which is a systematic search for x - ray emitting galaxies between 0 and 0.1 in rest - frame uv. starbursts are identified by applying criteria designed to distinguish between different types of activity in galaxies. these criteria are applied to 382 galaxies of the pds sample, to be the warm iras source catalog of de grijp et al. and to the iras galaxy sample of the lyman break galaxies of allen et al.. the resulting list includes 2 notable iras emitters : m82 and ngc 7714. the mean fir luminosity of these galaxies is @xmath0, slightly less than the mean luminosities of the nearby starburst nucleus galaxies ( sbngs ) observed with veilleux & terlevich ( 1997 ). in the far - infrared ( fir ), these galaxies show a continuous sequence with the normal galaxies, but can not be distinguished based on a color cut off. based on the colors of the galaxies, we define a starburst galaxy as an emission line galaxy where the source of ionization of the gas is of stellar origin, as determined from the standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. the radial variation of the starburst colors is similar to that of the normal iras galaxies. we find a correlation between the infrared colors and the fractions of barred and normal galaxies : the more massive starsts are preferentially more luminous, while the earlier type galaxies are more numerous. this result is consistent with the observation that large amounts of dust are swept away by starburst winds, suggesting that the origin of the dust is not clear. from the color distribution we can determine a bar frequency of 0.2 % ( from the uv colors ). the fraction of barred galaxies is also high, but seems to decrease towards late type morphologies. like for other sbengs, no preference for barred galaxies was found among the pud starsts. the presence of a high ratio of barred to normal galaxies suggests that the bar is mostly important in the late type galaxies rather than in the early type galaxies.

the mechanism for spontaneous magnetospheric reconnection weibel instability is discussed here with emphasis on the small - scale ( @xmath0 m ) seed - x points that are expected to grow from thermal fluctuations in the magnetotail current sheet. weibel instabilities are low frequency ( about zero ) electromagnetic instabilities which are capable of generating large ( tens of khz ) magnetic field amplitudes without the need for any magnetic dynamo mechanism. the small size of the magnetic field component in this case provides seed x - points on geophysically reasonable spatial and temporal scales. in the antiparallel case these may evolve into large - scale vortex - like structures, and spontaneous reconnection between adjacent magnetic layers is likely to occur spontaneously. - magnetic fields are observed not only in condensed astrophysical plasmas, but also in the geomagnetic tail ( where they are believed to grow up to a level comparable to the external magnetic field ) and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) systems @xcite. the origin of these magnetic fields is still unclear, although recent experimental evidence suggests their presence in planetary interiors. the main problem in modelling these large magnetic field systems is then to understand the connection between the emerging magnetic field structures and the already existing ( magnetic ) current flow. in this letter we explore this problem both analytically and with numerical simulations. we hypothesise that the growing instability is driven by an increase in the temperature anisotropy of the incoming electrons, i.e. when the electron pressure is anisotropic. the weibel field is generated in the plane parallel to both anisotropies, but perpendicular to the direction of higher thermal velocity, which in our case has been assumed as the parallel direction. thus the instability grows in a parallel plane without any external magnetic force. it is then possible to form a plasmoid - like current flow, or even a mott insulator, in the presence of magnetic fields along the current. this mechanism ( weibel self - organisation ) is of limited practical importance, as it will short - range ( e.g., within a few e - folding times ) dynamo effects which are likely to shut down existing magnetic bifurcation channels, thus limiting the ability to reconnect via weibel mode generation in the bi - maxwellian limit.
we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate changes in the behavior of amorphous solid water during a lda - hda first - order phase transition using the potential energy landscape ( pel ) approach. pel is a statistical mechanical approach that formally separates the configurational contributions to the partition function into contributions from local energy minima ( inherent structures " ), and vibrational excitations within the basins of attraction surrounding these minima. the present study explores how the properties of the system during pressure - induced lda / hda transformations compare with those reported previously for spc / e water using the st2 model ( see e.g., ref. [ ldahda ] ). we find that the pel properties of st2 water during compression and decompression support the viewpoint that lda and hda are the glass counterparts of two distinct megabasins in the pel, that is, the system follows two distinct trajectories on the pel. the pel results obtained using the pel indicate that a liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) is accessible in equilibrium, though a llpt is completely inaccessible in the simulations. in contrast, the regions sampled by the liquid - ice - vii and liquid - gas experiments exhibit a van der waals - like loop - like behavior, in the sense that the number of is having a given value of @xmath0, is positive in the density range associated with the local minima sampled in equilibrium and increases monotonically with the compression / decompression rates. this behavior is qualitatively the same as that observed in the experiments, suggesting that the llpt can be understood as a sub - glass - transition manifestation of the equilibrium llpt that has been recently demonstrated to occur in supercooled water. comparison of the pel behavior of simulated water with that observed experimentally suggests that the glass phenomenology observed in experimental water can be thought of as a ` ` supercritical'lda to hda transformation. we also demonstrate that the changes in some of the structural characteristics of the lda region during the pressure induced hda - to - ice transformation are similar to the changes observed in real water, in qualitative agreement with the conclusions drawn from previous studies.
in the framework of spin models, learning is characterised by the ability to perform multiple tasks in parallel and the capacity to adapt to different stimuli. we study the learning performance of an excitatory neuronal network performing two or more rules in parallel. at the beginning of the learning procedure, the network is able to perform the right answer to any of the rules. however the performance in the subsequent stages is limited by a lack of sufficient synaptic input. we quantify the degree of structural disorder in the system and propose that it is the presence of an energy term that modifies the response to an external stimulus. surprisingly, this feature leads to a non - monotonic function of the percentage of inhibitory synapses @xmath0 in the network, which can be interpreted as an entropic term characterizing the level of variability in the response. our results suggest that learning is a truly collective process, where a large number of units with intricate connections participate to the dynamics. multiple task learning, excitability and variability in neural systems are concepts that have been studied intensively since the discovery of the berry phase of brain function @xcite and have since been shown to be crucial for the performance of neural systems in a wide range of complex tasks. while single rule learning is easy to study, multi - task learning is harder to master. in particular, the most difficult task of a larger network is the simultaneous learning of a few rules, i.e. the three sequential rules, from which the final response is computed. despite the obvious desernence of this task in terms of the structure of the synaptic connections, the brain systematically learns these rules using all available resources and this is the same concept applied to the learning of more rules. therefore, it is beneficial to perform more tasks in order to realize a higher level of performance. recent experimental results have suggested that neuronal systems act as systems acting close to a critical state, where activity does not have a characteristic size. here we question if the same behaviour is observed for the response of an external stimulation. we measure the size of neuronal avalanches and find that for a network of 100 neurons, corresponding to about 50 % of the total activity, the number of neurons that participate in the learning process must be about 200, which is an order of magnitude larger than for a structurally balanced network. this clearly indicates that neural systems can not be reduced to a few functional states, but must rely on a more sophisticated network, able to incorporate new sensory information and new functions, involving not only the external stimulus but
we observe transmission degradation of sub - wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers ( tof s ) in warm rubidium vapour ( rb ). we demonstrate the ability to indefinitely maintain high tof transmission in a standard ` ` heater on '' setup. we also show that a heating element used to raise the surface temperature of the tof higher than the surrounding environment can reduce the accumulation of rb atoms and thus preserve transmission loss. this experiment suggests that high transmission can be achieved in relatively low rb density, even in the presence of the relatively high rb vapor densities needed for many low - power nonlinear optics applications. 99 r. spillane, ` ` quantum theory of light, '' ieee trans. antennas propag. * 14 *, 302307 ( 2007 ). d. l. cook, r. a. robbins, and j. s. nicholas electronic structure calculations, eds., ( springer - verlag, 2008 ), pp. 513. r. washburn, m. lvy, d. musters, a. k. gnauck, c. m. jocher, and b. j. veselka, nanophotonic switching with infrared pulses, eur. phys. j. d * 28 *, 183227 ( 2009 ). h. ritsch, v. hndchen, h. schnatz, t. r. thomsen, s. w. thompson, and a. v. feist, low - frequency magnetic field effects in fiber - coupled devices, phys. rev. lett. * 99 *, r41-r41 ( 2004 ). s. bergamini, b. darqui, j. e. santos, and m. b. plenio sistematic model, n. gisin, p. g. kwiat, and c. f. ross, solid - state quantum information, njp, china _ @xmath0these authors contributed equally to this work. _
we have performed global fits to the proton parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at @xmath0 from deep - inelastic scattering and drell yan data on deuteron targets, and have shown that the standard mstw input parameters are rather flexible. we demonstrated that about four chebyshev polynomials are sufficient for high precision and used this number in the valence and sea distributions. as a result, the resulting pdfs have 23 eigenvectors rather than the 20 used in the standard analysis. the uncertainties are found to be much larger than when the standard parameters were used. in our best fit, the parameters are essentially free, with only the choice of the contraction exponent being affected. the result is a significant improvement in the fit sensitivity, particularly for the valences quark pdfs, from what was previously a very poor to have a good fit. the lepton charge asymmetry is also found to increase the sensitivity of the pdfs. we have also investigated the effect of changing the form of the input parameters on the uncertainties of the global fits. the changes are small, and the magnitude of the uncertainty is similar to that for the standard pdf parameterisation. by comparing the results from our modified input parameters to the ones obtained in the parameterisation with the natural lhc asymmetry, we conclude that the asymmetry correction is not significant for the global fit. cern - ph - th/2009 - 124 + tum - hep-610/09 + mpp-09/24 + hep - ph/0912032 * robert fleischer, nicola serra and niels tuning * _ theory division, cern, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + [ cols="^,<,^",options="header ", ] = 0.1 cm = -2.5 cm = 22.0truecm 25 pt plus 1000pt minus 100pt # 1 # 1= to [ section ] 4 # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( 19#2 ) # 3 ( # 3 ) # = to l # 1 = = = cmmib10 specialpagefalse oddfoot @page>1 @font@page=1 _ available in color from h t t p://www.sns.ias.edu/@xmath1max / evenfoot
we consider the effect of umklapp scattering on the optical conductivity of a one - dimensional luttinger liquid near a mott insulator. the scattering process is analyzed within the framework of a certain hydrodynamical theory which takes into account the high - energy processes due to virtual excitations. the pseudo - momentum of the liquid, which is conserved by two - particle scattering, will decay very slowly in the vicinity of the fermi - surface due to the strong interaction ( for weak interactions ). this implies that the scattering rate is strongly suppressed in this low - temperature regime. we show that various scattering processes described by approximate conservation laws ( which are commonly used in the literature ) will lead to similar low - frequency behaviors whether or not the conductivity is finite or infinite for generic lattice systems. in the zero - frequency limit, all the mean - field ( dc ) and noise - corrected ( zeros ) limits of the system can be regarded as limiting cases. we argue that finite dc limits can be realized in simple model systems close to half filling, while infinite dc limits are realized in more complex model systems. consequently, a theory close to the mott transition will always be characterized by a finite conductivity ( an example are exactly commensurate systems ). many of the well - known transport properties of solids can be rationalized by the relativistic dirac equation. in this context, for example, the current - density - wave ( cwd ) transport in one - dimension systems is described by an ohmic loop which has a power - law dependence on the strength of the interaction @xcite. this is not the case in a two - dimensional metal, where the current is completely suppressed away from half filling due to quantum fluctuations. one should, however, expect a decay of the current in such a system. the reason for this is that the cwd wave has a phase - space which is exactly frozen at low energies and thus the dynamics of the dynamical system is frozen at non - zero energies as far as the weak interaction part of the hamiltonian is concerned. consequently the finite dc transport is expected to be infinite ( the hysteretic limit for a 2d system ) while the dc - conductivity will be infinite for a quasi - 1d system. from an experimental point of view, this picture is in good agreement with the recent discovery by zotos _ et al. _ in ( [ gammap ] ) in an anisotropic metal close to a comm
the connection between supernova remnants ( snrs ) and galactic clouds is a fundamental but poorly explored problem. in this paper, we investigate the relationship between the ionization fraction and the shock velocity of the snr - cloud interaction in order to take into account the recent modifications of the original manuscript by dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ). we show that the shaded area of the ism provides a well - defined region ( in the size @xmath0 pc ) where star formation can be induced by an encounter with an adiabatic snr, before the shock front reaches the entire cloud before being decelerated to subsonic velocities. when this happens, the enhanced star formation rate caused by the interaction allows the gas to cool even further, allowing for the formation of small star clusters despite the presence of a snr. the present manuscript is a step forward by providing a self - consistent, physically sound treatment of the above - mentioned modifications. a series of scientific papers has been published in the area of astrophysics and astronomy over the past thirty years. in each one, a distinguished contribution is made by one specific astronomer ( see, e.g., @xcite ). this manuscript is indeed a contribution by a distinguished astronomer to the subject of stellar evolution. the astronomer s office in stanford, california, usa, is operated under contract no. de - ac02 - 06ch11357 with the u.s. department of energy. the ability to independently determine the physical conditions of galactic clusters and galaxies provides considerable advantages in astrophysics, especially when dealing with problems related to the radiation and shock fronts of supernovae, i.e. the effects of relativistic outflows. according to the see text in issue 1 of this series, the astronomer described in section1 a method to determine the density of supernova remnant ( snr ) clouds based on the observation of a single rayleigh - taylor ( ray ) event in a star - forming region ( ism ). in section2, this method is applied to different types of snrs and to the calculation of the effective temperature of cool clouds. the results of the paper are highly dependent on the value of the cooling function of the cloud gas, derived from eqs. ( 27 ), and on the parameters of the x - ray or x - neutron star ( xr ) source used for the heating of the clouds ( see eq. 1 and 2 for the numerical simulations in section3.
we present the first quantitative analysis of the population of hot white dwarfs ( wds ) in the milky way, based on far - uv ( fuv, 1344 - 1786, @xmath0 = 1538.6 ) photometry obtained with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ). our photometric database contains about 40,000 hot - star candidates, mostly in the fuv range 0.8@xmath1 - 0.13, with photometric errors mostly from sdss ultra - violet ( uv ) imaging. matched optical photometry from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is used to construct ` ` cleaned '' catalogs of more than 13,000 uv sources, from which we extract hot star candidates with fuv - nuv discontinuity and nuv photometric error smaller than 0.3mag. these sources are used to carefully characterize the hot - wd population, to validate the initial - final mass relation ( ifmr ), and to study the galactic disk and halo geometry. we find that current models of mw geometries match the data well at intermediate latitudes ( 0.15 - 1 kpc ), but are somewhat discrepant at low latitudes and faint magnitudes. we explore, for the first time, multiple thin disk and thick disk components, emphasizing in this work the important implications of different ifmr, as our data are spread over a much larger sky area than was previously possible. the data show a slight but significant asymmetry between mw and sdss models with canonical geometry for stars and dust match, and the data at northern and southern galactic latitudes are better constrained by our data. we analyze the density of hot wds as a function of magnitude using the trilegal stellar population synthesis code, and find that the majority of our candidates are within 2 - 4 kpc from the plane, with a small spread in mass and a distribution of masses. the small offset in stellar density and mass - to - light ratio between the thick and thin disk components indicates that the thick disk is more widely mixed with the cold, metal - rich material than the thin disk, perhaps as a result of mixing of dust and gas from the uv - bright part of the interstellar medium ( ism ).
we have designed and built an optical fiber fed high - resolution echelle spectrograph ( paras ) attached to our 1.2 m telescope at the monsoon monsoon facility ( mt. abu ) in the western part of the thar desert, to provide simultaneous star - thar sky observations between 3800 and 9th magnitude at a precision of 1 m s@xmath0 or better, with an out - of - plane aspect ratio of @xmath1. we have developed a radial velocity ( rv ) technique using a combination of harps radial velocity data and a large dataset of rv data from the harps, keck - hires and aat(u.c.l. ) optical spectra. radial velocities are derived by cross - correlating target spectra with a suitable template mask based on spectral type g2k stars, to achieve a suitable numerical mask for the baryon absorption features in the spectra, and to maximize signal - to - noise ( s / n ). we report successful operation of the paras on a bright ( 1 - 7th magnitude ) and faint ( 1.5 - 5.0 ) jupiter - like exoplanet candidate stars, with a median seeing of 1.3 " from october to february, and 2 " from mid - march to june. monsoon observations are planned for a total observing time of 800 ks on each target. this will provide long term stability for the instrument, enabling multiple - target studies of exoplanetary systems around brightgiants up to at least 6.5 magnitudes of the host star, and covering the spectral type range of g1 - k. we have optimized the optical design and selected the most promising targets for this high - cadence observing program. the prospects for the present project are discussed, along with optimization of the prism and camera optics.

using the theory of superexchange interactions, which is valid in the limit of large on - site coulomb repulsion, we derive the transfer integrals between the relativistic pseudospin states in the second order of perturbation theory. we then compare our results to the results of unrestricted hartree - fock calculations, which assume that the so - coupling is small. we argue that, despite its smallness, the se theory works reasonably well for both ba@xmath0iroxmath1 ( with the strong so coupling ) and sr@xhot0iro@kents. many of the observed features, including the deformation of the ir - o - ir bonds and emergence of large antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions, can be rationalized on the basis of the se model. we also discuss the construction of the low - energy electron model, starting from the lda band structure with the so coupling. this model is used to derive parameters of interatomic exchange interactions using the non - linear sigma model. then, in calculations of the exchange interactions, we evaluate the influence of the crystal distortion and the size of the ba @xmath2 band on the magnetic susceptibility. we find that the magnitude of the in - plane anisotropy is much larger than the out - of - plane one. moreover, the magnetic moment matrix elements of the uniaxial model, obtained in the six - orbital model, are very similar to those of the compass model. this fact suggests that both geometries and metallicity are at work in the surfaces of iridates. + pacs numbers : 74.25.dw, 05.10.+e, 74.20.-q 2.5 cm * layered iridates with strong so interactions * + _ theory division, cern, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + _ max planck institute for nuclear physics, heisenbergstrae 1, 85748 garching, germany _ +
the ground state and metastable states of a spin glass are determined by the free energy landscape of the model. we compare and contrast the free - energy landscapes of two closely related models, the tap equations and the naive mean - field ( nmf ) equations. using a novel iterative algorithm, one is able to access low - energy states of the tap model whose free energy per spin is equal to the equilibrium free energy at the given temperature, with an excess _ per spin _ per site which is broadly consistent with a scaling form @xmath0 $ ] scaling with the system size. in contrast to the tap landscape, the nmf free energy has saddle points with large index ( up to 1 ) and the corresponding landscape is more rugged, attracting the iterative dynamics at ( or close to ) a threshold free energy where the minima numerically dominate the saddle points. as the temperature is lowered the states obtained approach those of a zero - temperature problem. the scaling behavior of the excess free energy and of the barrier heights for large values of the average free energy suggest that the optimal strategy to pursue the metastable state is to sculpt a finite - size surface with a high - energy surface such that the barriers between the minimum and its corresponding saddle point are closed in a fixed point rather than a limit cycle. standard algorithms for finding the ground state in spin glasses, such as the popular gradient descent algorithm, terminate at a free energy which is close to the critical value and there are no intuitive indications as to why this should be the case. here we propose a different approach, wherein one works with equations which are derived from the exact free energy surface, and works from there until they approach, or exceed, the critical free energy. we suggest that this might be a generic technique for finding low - cost states in hard optimization problems. the problem of obtaining a metastable ground state is analogous to that of computing the number of spins in a mott - insulator system in the spin - glass context.
we present ultra - deep _ u_-band images of the goods - n field obtained with the large binocular telescope ( lbt ). the optimal - resolution mosaics mosaics have fwhm @xmath0 mag arcsec@xmath1 and are the deepest images thus far for this field, reaching a flux limit of 23 mag. we compare the lbt results with the same data in the literature, and find that mosaics with the best seeing conditions get better images, but are slightly bluer overall. this difference is important in the context of extragalactic background light ( ebl ) measurements, as ebles are the only measurable quantity currently used to constrain the faintness of galaxies. by weighting the images based on the quality of the _ hst _ images, we are able to exclude nearly all sources that would cause a significant image confusion in the _ lbt_-band mosaics. the best - seeing subset currently contains about half the objects measured in the far - uv. there is not enough ebl in the outskirts of the brighter galaxies to explain the large differences between the two methods of computing the ebl, however. we find that the blue iebl derived from the integrated counts is missing about a factor of 3 - 5 of the uv flux in the outskirt of massive galaxies. we also use the number counts to place constraints on the incompleteness of the hst - ebl survey. at the faint fluxes probed by our study, the completeness of hst / ebl surveys is not yet reached, as a number of galaxies at bright redshifts show a large multiplicity of bright features. at fainter fluxes, and when stacking all images in the above - mentioned order - of - magnitude distribution, we still find a large fraction of faint galaxies. however, this fraction is largely determined by the seeing conditions in the brightest regions, which vary little with seeing and only a little with wavelength.
we investigate the relationship between nonlocality and entanglement, which are two central concepts in quantum physics. up to now, their relationship has not been fully answered especially in multipartite _ mixed _ states. in a unitary picture, without considering any dissipation and decoherence, the hamiltonian of the system is defined as _ genuine _ ( or three - way ) tripartite / multipartites, denoted by the svetlichny inequality ( si ) @xcite. however, there exists triperestite nonrelativality ( here we mean noncalality involving all three parties ) that does not violate si, i.e., it is not necessarily genuine. a proof of principle for this fact is hard to give a general conclusion. in view of the above, we devote our time to studying the complex opto - quantum mechanical ( qubit ) states with a high finesse cavity and a strong coupling ( @xmath0 ). in such a system, nonlocal correlations could be signalled by the violation of other weaker bell - like inequalities, e.g. the mk inequality. the ` drawback'of the mk is that its violation admits states with only nonzero correlations among the system s atomic modes. we show in what follows, that a highly mixed three - mode gaussian state, in which the si appears violated due to the failure of violating the mcgaugh - zeldovich ( mcgut ) inequality, produces a genuinely multiparite entangled state. the description of such a state using a wigner function is described by a set of quantum langevin equations. numerical results indicate that zero - bipartite and/or tri - pharithmically entangled states among the atoms occur. + * key words and phrases : * quantum langvin equation, multi - level system, mixed atoms, optical cavity, tampering with quantum states 2.0 cm -0.4 cm
we present _ xmm - newton _ observations of the proto - proto - elliptical galaxies ngc 3921 and ngc 7252. the long - term evolution of these galaxies will provide us with a unique opportunity to test whether or not these regions are undergoing major mergers, and whether they will be able to regenerate the x - ray haloes which were expelled during the nuclear merging phase. we find that in both galaxies, the hot gas mass in the remnant is comparable to that expected from a shock - heated gas model, but is several orders of magnitude below the temperature of the best fitting mekal model. we detect extended hi gaseous structures in both merger remnants, and suggest that hi infall may be a factor 1.5 larger than expected in either galaxy. however, we can not rule out the possibility that the hi in the two galaxies is subject to three different processes : infall of cold gas, mass loss from evolved stars, and secularly declining heating from supernovae. in all cases, the heating can not be supplied by stellar clusters alone, and we argue that the bulk of the energy is instead provided by the stellar component of the stellar cluster. we also find that the two remnants have very different mean stellar ages ( @xmath01.7 and 3.0 gyr respectively ), and that the observed luminosities of ngc 6252 ( 3921-x2 ) are consistent with this progenitor using data from _ chandra_. we propose that the different star formation histories of these two galaxies have produced different stellar mass loss and/or accretion events, and this is reflected in their high luminosity in x - rays. although both galaxies are expected to lose much of their gas after the infall of hi, we find little evidence that supports the hypothesis that the gas previously in these galaxies has been re - injected, or that there is currently a significant amount of hot gas outside the main remnant bodies.

the connection between non - gaussianity and statistical anisotropy is a fundamental issue in cosmology. in particular, the recently observed violation of the suyama - yamaguchi ( sy ) consistency relation, which states that the two - point correlators of the primordial curvature perturbation are invariant under rotating geodesics in the momentum space, is a signature of the statistical homogeneity of the universe. in this paper, we relax some or all the conditions previously stated in the @xmath0 formalism that are necessary for the validity of the sy consistency relation when the inflationary dynamics is driven by lorentz - invariant scalar fields only, i.e., the fields involved in the formulation of the cosmological expansion are not relativistically invariant. because of the similarity between the stable states of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( fr ) and the fluctuation - dominated ( lfw ) models, it is natural to use the latter for testing the theoretical predictions in the light of the above results. by relaxing the statistical isotropy condition, we get back the symmetry of the relation between the levels of non - wavenumber and amplitude of the scalar and vector fields involved. it is shown that the relevant regions of the parameter space are the so - called squeezed and collapsed limits. an example is given in which this symmetry is violated, but only at a high level in the perturbative expansion, in agreement with the results obtained by smith, loverde and zaldarriaga in a recent paper. as a by - product of this work, we show a worked example in which we get a violation of another nearly verseated version of the sus consistency relation. this violation is due to the inappropriate assumption of scale invariance of the linear stability tensor of the metric hamiltonian involved. # 1eq.

we propose an interpretation of the apparent discrepancy between the observed and the conventional expectations for supernova neutrino emission, expressed in terms of the average energy, of the low energy events observed by the kamiokande - ii ( kii ) experiment on sn1987a neutrinos. we argue that it is not possible to determine whether a single event is due to signal or background events. the volumetric distribution of the events allows us to exclude to a certain extent the contribution of a hypothetical background component, that has been assumed to be distributed uniformly in the detector with the same energy ( @xmath0 mev ) and seems to be limited to a finite number of events. under this assumption, and using the results of two recent analyses of the kii dataset, we were able to discriminate between the background and the signal events observed, finding that the former are consistent with the expectations, while the latter ones seem to be significantly deviant from them. this provides us with an independent way to vote for the existence of a background, independent of the statistical analysis of the data. the alternative scenarios that could explain the resulting discrepancy are analytically explored and found to be less likely. we also propose a new way to separate the signal from the background, assuming that a significant ( and possibly weak ) amplitudes of a few background events are present in the data, that could be related to the accretion of a ` compact object ', as suggested by some theories of supernova explosion, and that the events observed in kii are related to a peculiar ( or ` de - energized') phase of neutrinoless double beta - mode emission. we conclude that if this is the case, there is a price to pay for the inconvenience of dealing with a background that is potentially _ a priori _ equivalent to the mean value of the expected one. if, on the other hand, the significant amplitude of the observed signals is instead due to a wind ( or a wind clump, depending on the relative strengths of the two components ), then the expected average energy is higher than what expected in the theoretical models for the emission of the type that is usually assumed, and lower then what is expected in these models.
we present a new multiwavelength morphological classification method, based on the shapelet decomposition of a volume - limited sample of 1519 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). we analyze the optical and near - infrared ( near - ir ) images of each galaxy using a mixture of gaussians model to define and decompose the first ten principal component components. a karhunen - loeve ( kl ) transform is applied to the decomposition to estimate the density of the galaxies in each of the first nine kl modes. we then utilize principal component analysis to separate early and late type galaxies, and use the mixture model to show and describe the first principal component as a type of ` starting point'for the morphology, with subsequent modifications from the other eigenmodes resulting in a galaxy s unique morphology. for principal components obtained from the covariance matrix, the coefficients of the kl - transform are shown to be additive in the sense that galaxies with positive coefficients are more concentrated than galaxies with negative coefficients. we describe the method well and discuss the limitations of the method. we next perform a shapelet analysis on the images from all five bands of the sdss data release 1 galaxy sample, and compare the results with those obtained from @xmath0-band data. we find that in contrast to previous decompositions of sdss galaxies, which are almost exclusively based on one observing band, shapelets decompose efficiently across the entire spectrum, allowing us to give physical scale lengths and physical parameters, while at the same time giving a qualitative description of a galaxy morphology. this approach will be useful for analyzinggalaxy morphology, as well as for extracting structural information from large - scale structure - fitting studies. as a by - product of the analysis, we obtain : ( 1 ) very accurate estimates of the densities of elliptical and sdm galaxies, ( in decreasing order of hubble type ), ( 2 ) significantly different morphologies for the different three mixture classes, ( 3 ) classification as t - type, ( sb - sdm ), and ( 4 ) very similar results for elliptical galaxies, versus sdm and later.
we present a measurement of the production of tau lepton pairs ( @xmath0 ) in electron proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 301 or 319 gev, recorded by the h1 experiment at hera. the search for events with an isolated high transverse momentum isolated taru lepton, large missing transverse momenta or high hadronic system is performed. the sample is selected using an algorithm that uses an up to date set of neural networks to discriminate between the signal from electrons, muons or hadronic jets and the background from leptonic and hadronic decays. by comparing the data with the expectations from standard model processes, expected from lepton flavour conservation, we obtain an upper limit on the cross section of events containing an isolated tau - lepton or an isolated muon pair. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 08 - 065 issn 0418 - 9833 + september 2009 + * * h1 collaboration accepted by eur. phys. j. c. f.d. aaron@xmath1, m. aldaya martin@xfig.com * + _ submitted to eur.phys.j.c _ f. acernese et al. _ + _ accepted for publication in european physics journal c _ + the production cross section for @xcite, in association with a tau anti - neutrino and an muon, is measured in the kinematic region of failure -less production. the method of identification of hadronic tau decays leads to the identification of a new class of events, not observed in the standard model. these events are used to determine the position of the interaction vertex and to measure the trajectories of charged particles. the results are compared with those obtained using an inclusive data sample collected by the zeus collaboration, from which they are compared to previous measurements, finding overall good agreement, although there are large systematic uncertainties. * # 1 *, # 2 = 0.5 cm r. batley, p.bechtle, t.behnke, a.n.bell, d.j. culling, g.bella, s.bethke, j.bhme, c. beaudoin, v. boudry, w.b. eckardt, h.bouwmeester, k.w. berglund, s.
we state that very - long - baseline - interferometry observations of cepheids in the spiral galaxy ngc 4258 provide an absolute distance to this galaxy of 7.2@xmath0 0.5 mpc, as inferred from the hst key project calibration of the cepheid distance modulus. we adopt the best - fit theoretical @xmath1 distance scale of freedman _ et al. _ ( 2001 ), and we compare our _ ` ` pulsational '' _ estimates of the distance with those based upon observations, namely the theoretical white - dwarf and pulsating luminosity function ( wpl ) relations of fundamental pulsators with period @xcite. we find that both the slope and zero - point of the predicted wpl relations depend on metallicity in the sense that metal - rich pulsators follow shallower pl relations and are on average fainter than metal - poor ones. on this basis, the proposed empirical wpl relation for ngc4258 is significantly flatter than the lmc one, i.e., it is consistent with the observations, but not with the theoretical predictions. moreover, the predicted slopes are in very good agreement with the empirical distributions for lmc pulsators based on the ogleii microlensing survey data. in fact, by comparing our _ pulsational _ distance estimates with the pulsation models of maoz & stobie ( 1999 ), we show that the observed lmc period appears to be a little steeper than the predicted one for fundamental pulsator periods longer than 3 days. on the other hand, if only pulsating models with shorter periods, such as those suggested by n2001, we find good agreement between our preferred lmc and lmc distance moduli. in consequence, we state that the ` ` ` true distance '' modulus of ngc fourna is ` ` larger '' than the adopted lmc value by 10.92 mag, on condition that the measured values of the hydrogen and oxygen abundances are the same, or higher, than those adopted at the lmcs. thus, the distance modules we derive for the two most distant spiral galaxies with known lmc distances are in fair agreement with each other and with most of the recent empirical studies. using the current lmc - based and hst - based distance errors, we also recalculate the value of the intrinsic dispersion of the theoretical wpl distance in the range of 0.08 mag ( random error ), which turns out
we use numerical simulations to study the density and velocity structure of protostellar cores in the context of the gravoturbulent fragmentation model of molecular cloud formation. the density fluctuations are identified with molecular cloud cores that have column density profiles that often resemble that of hydrostatic bonnor - ebert equilibrium spheres, and that have velocity dispersions that are small, i.e. transonic, or even subsonic, in comparison with the full angular distribution of the mean free - fall velocity of the cloud. these characteristics are found to be consistent with those of quiescent, low - mass cores that are conventionally considered to be the result of the quasistatic contraction of a dense core as a result of gravitational collapse. in contrast to this, the velocity dispersion of the core is often spatially constant within the core, which indicates that it is a largely jeans - unstable core. therefore cloud cores in our model appear to form from a clustered and coeval compression of gas that is largely jeans unstable. on average, however, cloud cores formed in our models have very small and nearly constant l.o.s.s. velocities, which suggests that they are dynamical cores formed by highly anisotropic ram pressure. we interpret this as a consequence of the fact that the average density - weighted path length of gas contributing to the emission has a minimum at the core center, and thus a core s length is stationary with respect to small offsets in the plane of the sky. we also present a clear distinction between the lsd model and the single - density supersonic density model, the former having a larger fraction of coherent cores, and the latter having a higher fraction of strongly turbulent cores. this difference is quantified in terms of the energy budgets of the cores, with the former being dominated by the large - scale motions of the gas that are swept up by the core. our results are consistent with the idea that strongly - turbulent cores form when a finite fraction of the available gas mass is accumulated in collapsed cores. we discuss this agreement in the framework of the model of magnetically mediated star formation.
we study the structure of the world - wide air transportation network by analyzing the flight schedule data of more than 800,000 scheduled flights between cities in the period november 1, 2000 to october 7, 2000. we focus on the configuration of the cities and their distribution of betweennesses and betweenness centrality and estimate the average shortest path length @xmath0, the average minimum number of flights that one needs to take to get from any city to any other city in the world, to put all the cities on average, as a function of their distance. our analysis is based on the oag max database, which comprises 531,574 non - stop passenger flights, or flight segments, operating between 3883 distinct cities. we find that the most connected cities are the _ most central _, i.e., have the highest degree of cliquishness. in contrast, most pairs of cities are connected by four steps or less. we hypothesize that this fact is due to the fact that the global role of a node can be determined, by its within - module degree and its participation coefficient, from the pattern of intra- and inter - community connections. we establish that the degree - betweenness anomaly is related to the existence of ` ` communities '' in the network, and that it is enabled by the ` ` small - world '' property of networks, that is, the presence of a large number of cities with very small number of connections to other communities. we show that, in addition to the large centrality of cities, there is a small fraction of cities that are not directly connected to each other but have significant networks with ` ` community ''. most of these networks have approximately equal fractions of local module hubs and non - hub connectors. in all networks, we find a minority ( 0.5 % ) of non - hubs, which is significantly smaller than that of the average. we interpret this result as evidence of the preferential attachment mechanism in transportation networks, in which connections to additional communities, such as communities, play an important role. finally, we note that the above results are not affected by the effects of geo - political and socio - economic factors such as population density and economic development ; and that they are consistent with the expectations of a random graph.
we consider a thin magnetic dot, with magnetization perpendicular to its plane at @xmath0, placed upon a sc thin film. we study the properties of vortices with positive vorticity that are situated under the dot. we find that at first the vortex state appears, and with further increase of magnetization, the states turn into infinite series of such transitions. we derive the phase diagram of these states and compare them with those of the same dot without magnetization. our results suggest that the dot size is necessary for the vortex states to appear. superconducting systems offer new possibilities of superconductivity as compared with conventionalconductors. recently, superconductors have been in the spotlight again as candidates for the next generation of electronic devices. the interest in these devices is at least two - fold. first, there is the possibility of designing devices whose behavior can be easily tuned by a cosine - bose - einstein ( frbe ) effect @xcite. a second important reason is the desire to create devices where the _ edges _ of the insulating film can be directly examined and control. in contrast to the conventional fermi devices, the electronic dot can be very small to expose a small fraction of the parameter space of a superconductor. thus, it is possible to experimentally test whether whether the dot s properties are stable or not by probing the edges of the film. in this paper, we address this question by considering a small magnetic dot on a thin sc film. our aim is to study the gv states that appear when the dots are placed on the second plane of the sc film ( fig. [ schematics ] ). gvs are unstable states of the quantum fluctuation theory ( qft ) in which the flux from the dot penetrates into the film and the vortex - magnetization interaction can be switched off and on. the key idea is to create a small dot, whose magnetization does not change direction due to the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction. this idea was originally proposed by gottfried, as part of his experiments on top - spin " states of semiconductor quantum dots ( see, e.g., ref. 691@xcite ). the dots were fabricated from co, ni, fe, gd - co and sm - co alloys. they were smaller than 2 nm and had a high magnetization relative to the non - magnetic cuprates. a dot placed on a normal sc film was also considered, and it was shown that gvs can
a recently published transport optimization algorithm for routing of particles over a complex network is presented for three major types of complex networks : erds - rnyi, barabsi - albert, and uncorrelated scale - free networks generated using the configuration model. the algorithm is based on the idea of using shortest paths to assign uniform or random weights to every link and compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes and the betweenness of every node. randomly selected paths are chosen at random from among the other shortest paths on the network. the length of a path is computed as the sum of the weights assigned to the links that form the path. for economy of output, this means that the small - world character of network routing is preserved. the exponents of the power laws characterizing the above-@xmath0-law of shortest paths are known to be related to the network size and the number of nodes @xmath1. in this paper we show that the same types of laws characterize the average and maximum betweenness after optimization for all three types of networks. we show the existence of correlations between the optimal weights of the links and the average degrees of the nodes connected by them. this is particularly useful for the case of random networks, in which case the correlations destroy the possibility of constructing exact solutions for the routing problem in polynomial time. in order to understand the usefulness of the algorithm, we examine the correlation between the average sp betweenness and the network - size and compare the results obtained with those obtained without optimization. our results show that, regardless of network type, the average path length scales with the logarithm of the size of the network : it increases slower with network size for networks with smaller average degree ( or smaller average distances ) and shows no further improvement by relating the link weights to the node betweennesses. furthermore, the correlations introduced in the paper are not present for the unconnected networks we consider. these results are consistent with previous studies and suggest that our algorithm is at least as efficient as other recently proposed algorithms for routing optimally.
we describe a method for loading bose - einstein condensates into a double - top offe - pritchard trap. this method is based on an exponential reduction of the minimum of the axial magnetic field magnitude in a rotating bias field so that trapping effects are reduced and the double - well structure can be realized. we discuss the conditions for success of such a trap, which includes a barrier height comparable with the condensate chemical potential and a selection of the field orientation so that interference is limited and the chemical potential does not influence the barrier height. a numerical calculation shows that for a system with a chemical potential in the range 20 - 30 g the experimental barrier height can be achieved if the strength of the centrifugal force is allowed to be varied. more than a century ago it was proposed to use a magnetic trap with a cylindrical symmetry to induce rf scattering of alkali atoms @xcite. this technique has been used to trap atoms in an atomic cloud and to study trapping phenomena ( e.g., rf evaporation ) where the cloud is cooled first in a single - well and then in a two - well setup. in this setup a trapping scheme is devised where two coupled coils run parallel to the axis of the confining field and are perpendicular to it. using this scheme, recently experimental progress has been made in reducing the size of the trap to a reasonable level. the current setup has been described in detail in a number of studies, including those for which the confinement in the trap is @xmath0 g. the methods described in this paper describe well beyond the simplest case of a magnetic oblique trap, where the field is provided by a thomas - fermi method ( mexican hat ) functional form. more complex trap concepts will be presented in a subsequent paper. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 e. knill, _ optical coherence and quantum optics _ ( op. phys., new york, 1983 ). d. l. masters, ` ` the bec project, '' j. phys. * 12*(12 ), 135 - 158 ( 1985 ). s. p. pusey, d. a. lin, j. j. wineland, and c. w. cornell rb@xmath1 dipartimento di fisica, universit degli studi di milano - bicocca, + p.za l. da vin
we extend the second swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) catalog of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) to include a comprehensive sample of 112 luminous ( @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 ) long - duration grbs with known redshifts and upper limits. we construct a robust sample of grbs above a fixed luminosity limit and discuss the redshift distribution of their spectral features. based on this dataset, we investigate the relationship between the grb rate and the star - formation rate density normalized to rest - frame uv - selected galaxy luminosities, using the recently - compiled grb redshift diagram @xcite. we find that grbs are observed to be more frequent than star - forming galaxies at a given star formation rate, in the sense that the cumulative redshift - dependent ratio of grb to star formation - rate density,, decreases with redshift, roughly as described by a simple power law. although the precise evolution of this ratio is not well understood, recent observational and theoretical arguments suggest that the observed behavior is consistent with a scenario where grbs occur primarily in low - metallicity galaxies, and that the star formation occurs in metal - poor systems with suppressed star formation below a fixed energy. we develop a model for the inferred from the observed distribution, and we compare it with the cosmic reionization history of star formation, the production of metals in the intergalactic medium, and the ionization state of cosmic gas. in this work, we do not assume that the reddening of the universe as a function of time has anything to do with the observed redshift dependence of the ratio, but rather that it is simply a consequence of the evolution of the cosmic rareness, as measured by stellar mass - weighted stellar mass functions. because a significant portion of extragalactic objects are expected to be metal poor, we are prepared to accept a range of alternative scenarios, including the presence of a cosmological phase transition at high redshift. we also are willing to accept deviation of the observed properties of the igm from standard cosmology, provided that the recent star formation rates are scaled - down relative to the present - day rates. we are thus able to evaluate the likelihood of various hypotheses for explaining the origin of the metal suppression and the observed grb - star formation redshift relationship. our analysis indicates that this relation is most likely due to a physical basis such that metal enrichment has occurred at a relatively low level in galaxies with low metallicities.
we study the dipole - light interaction between two quantum dipoles which are immersed in an optically active surroundings. in particular, we consider a situation where the two dipoles are orthogonally polarized, and the orientations of them are perpendicular to the interdipole axis. we find that the collective behaviors ( including the damping rates and the interaction induced level shifts ) are affected by both the shape of the surroundings and the optical rotation of the surrounding medium. several numerical examples are given to show the robustness of our results against a broad range of the average refractive index. 99 p. amaro - seoane, l. c. andreani, and d. n. christodoulides, _ principles of photonics _, 2nd ed.

the dynamical response of a bose gas at zero temperature to a periodic lattice potential is investigated in the presence of a moving vortex. we find that the vortex damps the dynamic structure factor, which in a tight - binding lattice induces an effective coupling between the boson population and the vortex motion. the coupling intensities as a function of the vortex mass are calculated and compared with those expected for a system in which no vortex is present. the latter result is obtained for the case of local interaction between bosons and is confirmed numerically by ohmic damping. the dynamics of a quantum vortex is investigated numerically in the context of jaja lattice models, and it is shown that, in addition to the well - known aharonov - bohm damping, an additional source of hydrodynamic damping due to the interaction with the long - wavelength phase fluctuations is considered. the possibility of observing quantum fluctuations in the macroscopic behavior of a lattice that is confined inside a square lattice has attracted an enormous interest in recent years. it has been realized that a wide range of lattice geometries can be realized in ultracold atom experiments, and great progress has been made in the fabrication of two - dimensional structures that allow the experimental investigation of non - equilibrium vortex dynamics @xcite. the study of large - scale dynamical systems in periodic lattices has also recently attracted an increasing interest, both in the superfluid and in the bose - hubbard model, and this is likely to be a useful field for the understanding of the peculiarities of liquid helium and other strongly correlated gases. several interesting physical properties can be obtained in lattices of bosons inside them, among them the frequency - dependent spectrum of bragg scattering from a central vortical mode of a boson, the so - called wannier function, and the on - site interaction energy and the recoil energy. in this letter we shall review some analytical results that are valid for a wide class of lattices, including the @xmath0rb lattice, which were recently realized in experiments with a positron condensate in optical lattices and in 2d swansea arcs.
we report results of a detailed study of the dipping low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) source x1624 - 490 using the _ bepposax _ observation of this source during dipping. this is the first detection of empirical dipping in this source, and spectral analysis of the data shows that there is clearly dipping in. the source is characterized by two emission components, one of which was totally absorbed in deep dipping, and the other which is shown to be due to progressive covering of an extended and variable component, probably the accretion disk corona ( adc ). in the present work we have measured the depth of dipping and the extent of absorption of the unabsorbed emission, using only one dip spectrum which was obtained from a simultaneous analysis of non - dip and deep dip data. with this very deep dataset it is shown that the nature of dipping is well - described by a combination of a point - like blackbody plus extended comptonized emission model ( church et al. 1999 ), plus a progressive covering absorption model ( bauciska - church 1995 ), and this model can also explain the spectra of all the z - track and atoll sources investigated in a recent _ asca _ survey ( lehnert et al.2000 ). we find that in dipping this model requires a fine tuning of several parameters, and we have used it to obtain the first determination of the orbital period of. the inner radius of the adc component in dipping is found to be @xmath0 kpc, the bolometric luminosity of the blackbody component is in the range 70 - 100 erg s@xmath1 and the absolute magnitude is determined to be between 2.0 and 7.0@xfig21.5. the offset of the inner emission region from the inner disk ( if extended ) is in good agreement with the observed extent of dipping this suggests that this could be the most luminous source of blackbody emission in dipping. the full width at half maximum of the point spread function below 2.5 kev is also determined from a spectral model which includes a dust scattered halo. our spectral modelling with the halo for all dipping sources shows that in both dipping at low and medium dipping the line of sight grazing gas scintillation counters are dominant, but in the band dipping is dominated by the dust - scattered component. for about half a year, during which dipping was observed, there was an excess of soft excess in the 0.110 kev band, which
we investigate large - amplitude magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) disturbances in galactic molecular clouds, using numerical simulations. our simulations represent the first self - consistent treatment of turbulence in a highly compressible, magnetically - dominated ( @xmath0 ) fluid. we restrict the dynamics to plane - parallel geometry with periodic boundary conditions, and ignore ion - neutral slippage. this is the simplest possible model that incorporates magnetic fields and gravity self - consistently. we have performed several different types of simulations using the basic model described in this paper to explore the conditions under which moderate - amplitude mhd turbulence is most effective for supporting clouds against gravity, and to determine how long it takes for the free decay of an initial wave spectrum to result in a quasistatic equilibrium. the free - decay times are typically comparable to the gravitational collapse times of at least the ( higher - density ) clumps ; yet general internal collapse has not occurred. we find that ( 1 ) clouds can be supported for a significant length of time in the presence of nonlinear dissipation and self - gravity ; ( 2 ) the cloud complex age tends to exceed the characteristic collapse time for clumps at densities well above the ` ` mean density '' of the system ; ( 3 ) the relative importance of magnetic, kinetic, and gravitational energies is comparable in detail for several clouds at a range of scales, suggesting virial equilibrium ; and ( 4 ) a moderate - magnetic field can provide a pressure gradient comparable to that of gas pressure in cloud complexes. basic observational results for molecular clouds are discussed. we provide detailed tests of the numerical model and use it to interpret observations. finally, we extend our results to astronomical systems and discuss directions for future research. = 1
we investigate the evolution of the vertical metallicity gradient of the galactic bulge formed from a thin stellar disk through bar instability using collisionless n - body numerical simulations with different disk parameters ( @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] ). we adopt the thin disk model ( pds ) for our simulations and thereby investigate whether the simulated bulge can be flattened out to the observed extent in the central 3 kpc and subsequently evolve into a fully developed triaxial bulge similar to that observed in the disk galaxy ngc 7252 ( dwek et al. 2010 ). the results of the present numerical simulation show that if the original thin disk was formed from an initially cold dark matter ( cdm ) halo, then the bulge formation was likely dominated by dissipative processes as suggested by recent observations ( e.g., gilmore & reid 2013 ). as a result, the disk size for the present model is much smaller than that in the pds. the simulated profiles for the whole disk can be fit well by two disk components : a thin disk with cylindrical rotation supported by a weak bar and a thick disk with a strong bar. the thick disk has higher velocity dispersions and a smaller amplitude of rotation than the thin one. although the initial vertical metagalactic rotation supports a stronger bar, the latter is found to be weak and can be fully developed only at the innermost kpc in the simulated disk. the difference in the mass - ratio between the thick and thin disk is only about 0.2, which is consistent with the fact that both components of the galaxy are observed to have a ` ` boxy '' bulge ( = ` ` taurus-2 '' ). other disk components are found to have similar kinematical properties of the thin and thick disks. it is shown that models with steeper disk - to - bulge conversion efficiency ( tcds ) can reproduce the observed steeply rotating and cylindrically inhomogeneously metal - poor stellar populations in the galactic disk in a self - consistent manner. thus tcds can provide a good explanation to the observations. on the contrary, models with less efficient mixing of stellar populations with different initial metallicities ( i.e., with different [ mg / fe ] values ) do not match the observed gradients as well as the evolved ones. this is mainly due to the dynamical evolution of stellar bars in tcds, which can not account for the strong bar in our models. however
we consider the yet - unsatisfactory definition of necessity introduction in natural deduction systems modal or fully - fledged first - order modal logics. we recommend the use of modal operators whenever possible instead of the above partly ( or non ) computational quantifiers. we say that _ our input systems are rather modal rather than modal_. in particular, we are able to prove that full extensionality and contraction of ( light ) formulas are not needed in the step context, as in the usual context, where only refutation relevant assumptions are allowed. _ our _ input system _ is a modal extension of berger s tool @xmath0 from @xcite, which is itself a natural deduction presentation of the so - called classical into heyting arithmetic. it relies on the modal version of dialectica, a transitive - meaning theory of natural inference which extends the classical logic to more general formulas and beyond. its soundness is achieved by the light modal dialectica interpretation of a formula, which allows for a full translation from existential formulas to just existential ones. _ the light modification of the well - known _ kreisel implication _ is crucial for the reproduction of the soundness theorems for dialectica - based interpretations, i.e., they must be proved soundly in front of any formula that is not necessary. we enforce the above - mentioned restrictions on non - modal formulas, and in particular on refutation irrelevant ones, by means of the _ modal interrogation _ technique. we illustrate our approach with specific examples, and also with some recommendations for monte - carlo simulations. _ _ 2000 mathematics subject classification _ : _ 35d45 ( primary ), 35a25 ( secondary ). _ key words and phrases _ : modules, modal logic, synthesis, extension, synthesis algorithm, inter - programming languages. _ ams program summary _ : 37n25, 37n30, 37m20, 37p25. _ licensing provisions _ : creative commons attribution license ( cc by 4.0 ), arxiv:0705.2159v1. _ programming language used _ : fortran 77. _ computer _ : all systems under study. _ operating systems under consideration _ : unix, linux, windows, windows xp, irix.
we present vla - angst, a large program to obtain spatially - resolved star formation histories for a volume - limited sample of 69 nearby ( @xmath0mpc ) galaxies with high spatial and spectral resolution data cubes of the atomic gas traced by the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen ( ). the survey was designed to provide galaxies at the highest possible resolution and sensitivity, using multiple configurations of the nrao very large array ( vla ) in multiple configurations to achieve that goal. as part of the program, we also provided archival vla observations of a subset of the target galaxies which were previously catalogued with the things survey. the angst galaxies were observed with the vla in three configurations : a b-, c-, and d - configuration, yielding a total of 3h of observing time. in this paper, we describe both the design of the survey and the implementation of the data reduction protocols. we have applied the usual deconvolution and reduction protocols to the high - resolution, high - signal - to - noise ( s / n ) vla data cubes, and have analyzed the resulting color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in order to obtain a full spectrum of the star - formation history ( sfh ) of the galaxies in the sample. we find the overall sfhs to be comparable to or more detailed than those of the things sample. the main difference between the angst and things datacubes is in the amount of velocity resolution, being 4@xmath1 times larger, which is important for things - like objects and well below the saturation limit for things data. in addition, the angst survey has a much broader range in velocity and velocity dispersion than things, allowing the exploration of larger ism volumes. we also provides a new view on the evolution of the local dwarf galaxy population, in particular the aging populations of low - mass and high - mass objects. the results are in agreement with the expectations from a new catalog of nearby galaxies based on the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury program ( angst ; *??? * ).
the newly discovered binary be x - ray binary @xmath0cas is the most unusual compact object in the small magellanic cloud, with a mass - accreting black hole in a close binary system. in this paper we report on our extensive photometric monitoring of the source over four observing seasons ( 1997 september - 2001 february ) with the t3 0.4 m automatic photometric telescope at fairborn observatory in the patagonia mountains of southern arizona. we find that the optical variations are cyclic with timescales of 55 - 93 days, while the x - rays are variable on a much shorter timescale of 1 - 55 days. the ratio of the x- to optical variations shows a strong positive correlation, with the cycle length varying with time between 55 and 93 days. this correlation is particularly strong at the relatively faint end ( l@xmath1 ), which implies that the variations within the optical region of the disk are driven by a dynamo ( i.e., an inhomogeneous magnetic field with a surface connected to the stellar surface ) rather than by bondi - hoyle accretion onto the newly discovered companion. another possible explanation for the optical flux variations is that they are caused by changes in the density structure of the accretion disk. the most likely candidate for the disk dynamo is the oscillatory modulation of active magnetic complexes ( e.g., the so - called kubo - sunyaev effect ). to confirm this interpretation we have made several key measurements on the magnetic field strength, magnetic area, and surface brightness fluctuation frequency, and cyclic variations in the siiii and siiv line strengths. there is a near - universal anti - correlation between the optical and x -ray fluxes which, though different, all suggest the presence of surface connected magnetic fields at these heights. this provides evidence for the existence of surface magnetic fields on the disk of at least 2 - 3 times higher area and/or strength. we also found evidence for evolution in the stellar photospheric density structure, in the sense that the disk becomes more unstable to density perturbations as the magnetic flux level increases. the optical variation is also cyclic in time and can be described by a cycle length of 2 - 4 days. we discuss the implications of these results for the currently proposed models for the binary accretion hypothesis.
we have obtained a hst / wfos spectrum of a new candidate for white dwarf ( wd ) in the core of the globular cluster ngc 6397. this object ( cv 1 ) has a much redder uv flux distribution than any previously known wd found in field stars and is characterized by an unusually red 2 4686 emission line ratio. the high temperature and broad line appear consistent with the hypothesis that this star is a high gravity object such as a wd. we find that cv spectra can be modeled with model atmospheres that include the effects of stellar interactions including : ( 1 ) tidal capture and exchange collisions between main sequence ( ms ) stars, ( 2 ) stellar interactions in high - density environments, and ( 3 ) cluster dynamical evolution. a comparison of cv time series with detailed models of stellar evolution shows that these two populations have fundamental differences. the cv disks of field field stars are consistent with being faint quiescent dne with short lifetimes. however, the doppler periods ( @xmath0 days ) of most cvs are much shorter than the lifetimes of field cvs. this may be caused by a different formation mechanism of tidal capture / exchange collisions, or by the different physical conditions in the two populations. cvs in globular clusters generally have shorter lifetimes than those in the field, although this is probably a result of the different densities of the clusters. it may also be due to the different formation mechanisms of dwarfs in clusters, as suggested by some observations. by combining all available data for cv 14, the wd photometry of this cluster shows that it has a disk brightness that is consistent with a disk of about 2.5 magnitudes fainter than that of the average am her system. we propose that cvs 13 and 4 may be old novae ( or perhaps old gamma - ray repeaters ). cv 4 is either a low accretion rate dn or a magnetic wd in a binary system. in any case, it is the faintest wd known to date in the 6397 cluster.
we consider a scenario in which a disk of @xmath0-size dust particles is embedded in a residual gaseous disk around hr 4796a. we show that the disk gas is subject to two independent physical effects : 1 ) hydrodynamic drag by the gas and 2 ) the radiation pressure of photons emitted by the central object. in addition to the radiative drag, the stellar radiation exerts a radiative pressure in the radial direction which promotes the motion of the dust particles. we hypothesize that the resulting ring structure is similar to that found around the young protostellar object gre by beck and collaborators and that it is a quasi - static feature of the accretion disk. in this picture, the presence of the sharp surface density variations associated with the ring at larger radii are similar to the ones observed around saturn s f ring. therefore, the ring itself may be perturbed by either a planetary or stellar companion and/or the particles may be gravitationally perturbed. we briefly recapitulate the physical interaction between particles, radiation, and residual gas in the disk. we suggest that these particles provide a supply of the dominant contributors to the ir emission of the ring. finally, we discuss the implications of these results for planet formation and the ubiquity of similar rings around other early type stars. = -0.5 in = = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2=1>0.51-.500 -.50-.5110>2.50-.54 [ 1 ] # 1#2#1@xmath1 # 1 # 2 # 3 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3)(#1,#2)#1#2 # 3 # 1to 0pt#1 & = = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx10 scaled 2 to * the dynamics of dust, stars : formation, planetary systems ; stars : circumstellar matter stars : early - type stars : mass - loss infrared : stars.
we present results from new modeling efforts for the infrared radiation from photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) in starburst galaxies and nearby galaxies, and discuss the effects of gas phase abundances and model geometry on the atomic and molecular line ratios and intensity ratios of predicted far infrared cooling lines. our work is based on the pdr model of th85 ( http://astro.phys.utexas.edu/summaries/ ), but updated through the use of the most up - to - date values of elemental abundances, chemical rate coefficients, and grain photoelectric heating rates. we have performed extensive simulations for both planar and spherical pdr clouds with reduced gas metallicity ( @xmath0 0.1@xmath1 10 ) and without external dust. the most important new results are obtained for the [ c ii]/fir intensity ratio and the [ o i]/co intensity ratio for our standard model. we find that reducing the gas phase abundance by a factor of 2 or more in a 35 pc cloud has little effect on the intensity ratios and line strengths of atomic lines and far infrared continuum emission from grains, except in the low - density regime, where the effects are more pronounced. changes in the model geometry have a pronounced effect, particularly in the innermost cloud layers where the gas densities are higher and the grain abundance lower. in the outer cloud regions where the atomic abundances are more homogeneous, the changes in gas density and gas temperature are not important. however, the increase in the total ( gas plus dust ) column density in a spherical cloud with a reduced co envelope produces a decrease in the co envelope brightness, and consequently increases the far - infrared luminosity. this effect is most pronounced in the dense part of the cloud, where most of the co rotational emission from the starburst galaxy is absorbed by the uv - bright starburst nucleus. our results are applied to an ensemble of spherical, planar, refractory pdr cloud clouds around a b star ( m82 ) which contains about 25 % of the total hii mass, and we discuss the effect of varying the column density and/or filling factor through an irradiated pdr.
the ability of a system to learn a new rule is the main component of its learning success. we show that the most difficult rule to learn is the ran rule, where only 50 % of final success is obtained. this rule leads to universal properties in the learning of a complex system, independent of the details of the system or the task assigned. we also study the effect of the parameters influencing synaptic plasticity on the learning performance. finally we question the question of what happens when a second chance is given to the configurations failing the right answer. epsf.tex # 1#2#3acta. phys. pol. * b *, # 1 ( 19#2 ) # 2 cerebral monte carlo ( cpc ). # 1 european organization for scientific research ` crescut ', ` version 2 ', march 28, 1999 ( apj ). @xmath0e - mail : cresciut@jhu.ac.cn it has been observed in neuroscience that when a neuron is connected to several synaptic sites ( more precisely to a gate ) the total charge released by the neuron is proportional to the number of synaptic connections. this behaviour can be very different in the case of inhibitory synapses, which play a crucial role in neuronal plasticity @xcite. in the functional network of a neuron, the release of charge is distributed according to a power law with a zero value according to the neuron s activity level. the power law is inherited from the input neuron and the output neuron reciprocates the action by forming a potential. the potential is controlled by the presence of other neurons which are connected to the same gate but which are unable to respond rapidly to the incoming charge spike. the field theory explains the universality of the learning behaviour of this network and predicts that for a network with inhibitory synaptic connections, learning should be possible with a high percentage of success ( or, equivalently, with a small percentage of failure ). this result has been confirmed in experimental studies, but there are also many questions that still have to be answered.
the trajectory of the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) from the sun to 1 au is unknown. all the available information on the cme originates from the remote - sensing data provided by the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) and the in - situ data obtained by wind ( or ace ) spacecraft at 1 au. the interplanetary space between the corona and 1 au thus had a large observational gap, and therefore the propagation of cme from @xmath0@xmath1 au to 1 ap was unclear. here we use the kinematic models ( dips, mhd simulation ) to try to recover the basic kinematics of a cme originating in the interaction region with the co - rotating interaction region ( cir ). we focus on the fast cme of interest here, which is a structure embedded in the cir, and the following slow stream ahead of it. from the analysis of the three observations, we find that ( 1 ) the differential propagation speed between the fast and the slow stream is significant enough to indicate an eastward deflection of the mc from the radial direction ; ( 2 ) the deflection angle between the observed cme leading edge and the solar equator is in agreement with the value estimated by the van eck et al. ( 2001 ) time - stationary non - force - free flux rope model for a slow cme, but deviates significantly in the azimuthal angle from the plane of the sky ; ( 3 ) the maximal vertical scale height of the observed mc flow is about 2.3 times smaller than predicted by the geomagnetic field model, which has a slow shock - like atmosphere, and ( 4 ) the intercepting force experienced by the mc is roughly equal to the pre - existing deflection force when the mc reaches the earth. considering that the fast / slow cmes are the most important driver of space weather, we suggest that their geoeffectiveness is strongly dependent on the location and orientation of their source regions, which directly affects the strength and duration of their encounters.
we present new near - infrared @xmath0 photometry for six y dwarfs identified in the _ wise _ database. three of the objects have been identified as brown dwarfs with spectral types t8 y2 ( wisep j041022.71@xmath1150248.5 ), three have spectral types y3/y4, one is a tentative early - type l dwarf, and two are y2 with unusually blue colors. we determine appropriate temperatures and gravities for the components and use these, as well as the observed spectral types, to derive far - infrared spectral energy distributions and absolute magnitudes. we show that the new photometry is consistent with previously published spectra and that the condensates and clouds included in the models for these objects have important effects on the observed spectra. new models which include the chloride and sulfide clouds also seem to reproduce the observations quite well, and reproduce the lack of a strong cloud signature in the spectra of the t6 and early - t6 objects. we find that models without these clouds predict a cooler and less dense atmosphere than the currently available cloudy models, and use higher - resolution data to confirm this. we also present a far - red spectrum of one of the y0 dwarfs, obtained as part of a search for cs i i lines in a spectroscopic sample of neutral hydrogen ( cs ) in 400 k objects. the spectrum shows that the cs i lines are present in the spectrum of ugps j0722 - 270540. this brown dwarf is a likely binary, and we set upper limits on the mass and age of this system of around 141212 gyr and 6.4 gyr. the other two objects have higher upper limits. we set an upper limit on the brown dwarf mass of around 10 - 7 m(3 - 7 au ), and show that this system is probably composed of two components. the three brightest y0 dwarf stars are all significantly fainter in the mid - infrared than currently reported, but otherwise the data are consistent with the previous results of cushing et al. ( 2011 ). we use these new data and the previously published palomar wirc photometry to estimate temperatures and gravity for the objects with t8 spectral types. appropriate high - resolution spectroscopy is, however, apparently required to confirm the nature of the changes with spectral type.
we present a new detection scheme for high rate, long - distance quantum key distribution based on the sine - wave gating and low - frequency band filtering of a single photon avalanche diode. the scheme relies on the single - photon - avalanche - diode s capacitive response under sine wave propagation with a detector temperature of @xmath0c and a dc - bias voltage of 53.5 v. we show that the detector can detect weak avalanche signals whose amplitude is below the threshold set by the detector temperature and which can only be discriminated by a threshold discriminator. the resulting detector has a detection efficiency of 33 mbps and a quantum bit error rate of only 1.6 % which is well above the expected lower limit of 0.2 % due to the extinction ratio of the quantum intensity modulator. this technique is suitable for scenarios which require a high rate of photons sent by alice, e.g. longer fiber lengths. continuous - variable quantum information protocols such as the quantum information key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite, where one bit of information is encoded in the position of an optical pulse of a remote source, have generated considerable interest due to their amenability for quantum communication and computing applications. in order to exploit the advantages of quantum kd in the quantum regime, it is important to set up low - cost, high - speed quantum computing devices which take advantage of the new generation of quantum technologies. multi - photon systems with built - in storage and processing have proven to be a useful platform for quantum information transfer, as they allow transmission of quantum information over long distances and are relatively robust against photon loss. long distance quantum communication systems tend to use one or more entangled photons as the key carriers. the key - carrier - entangled state can be stored in a few mb@xmath1 of solid state data in the form of a two - photon bag. the advantage of this high - density quantum information protocol is twofold : it allows for long distance secure communication at high rates, while reducing the risk of decoy states and other sidebands which could potentially generated by non - linear gains in the power amplifier is decreased. moreover, the low cost and size of these high - rate quantum computing systems make them an excellent candidate for quantum computation and quantum information processing. in the future, optical quantum computing based on quantum gates will allow for the realization of quantum communication networks. one major advantage of quantum computing with photons which are protected by strong optical polarization interference is the creation of an effectively unlimited set of
we present near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopic observations of 28 star - forming ( @xmath0 ) galaxies selected in the _ ohs / cisco _ infrared deep field ( sins ) survey, using the h@xmath1swith program and the vimos instrument at the vlt. the primary aim of the program is to measure rest - frame uv spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and estimate photometric redshifts from them, with the aim of comparing them with those obtained from multi - slit spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting, in order to assess the accuracy and feasibility of deriving sfrs, dynamical masses, and star - formation rates ( sfr ) from them. we have also investigated the reddening effects in these galaxies, and attempted to improve upon earlier nir studies by systematically selecting weaker emission lines such as h&k and the 4000 break, falling in the same redshift range as the stellar continuum. we find that the sfr and dynamical mass derived from uv - selected galaxies are in good agreement with each other, while those from nir - selected objects are systematically below, and above, the stellar mass range derived from three - dimensional ( 3d ) sed fitting. however, nir spectroscopy of nir selected passively - evolving galaxies is still unable to accurately constrain the origin of the shallower sfrrs, mostly because of the limited number of well - defined emission lines in the sins stacked spectrum. in the presence of a broad component ( i.e., a component emitting from regions which suffer more extinction regions ), we have investigated how the nir sfr varies as a function of stellar mass. from our best - fit sed fitting, we conclude that, while the uv extinction is the dominant factor determining the total sfr in these passively evolving galaxies, the ism metallicity which is largely unaffected by extinction, and the relative contribution of star formation activity to the growth of the total stellar mass can not be properly characterized from sed fitting alone. on the other hand, the broad line component can be reasonably well fitted by a simple stellar population.

the single-@xmath0-spin model is a paradigmatic model for glassy systems, where interactions between the spins occur in close proximity. we investigate the dynamical behaviour of this model in the region where the relaxation takes place, and find interesting features in its asymptotic dynamics. in particular, the system undergoes an equilibrium transition at a temperature where the temperature @xmath1 above which the relaxation dynamics stops. the interpretation of this transition as an ` entropy crisis'for the system is shown, and the structure of the metastable states, identifying metastable points with local minima of the mean - field energy functional, is discussed. despite the simplifications involved, this model exhibits some interesting dynamical features not seen in other models of this kind, such as : a significant dependence of the temperature on the class of states evolving ; a spontaneous birth / death of states with temperature ; and off - equilibrium dynamics. * symmetries and baryonic interactions in a multi - spin hamiltonian are a subject that has been studied with great success @xcite, and for which a number of interesting effects have been observed. these studies are most notably the discovery of _ multiplexing _, i.e. existence of multiple peaks in the phase space in spite of the absence of a singular volume, and of quantum critical points in the thermodynamic limit. moreover, the discovery that it is possible to engineer non - trivial states with a very high degree of sophistication, leading to new paradigms for the interaction physics, and that these states can be ` ` broken '', that is, that states that no longer form ( a ` ` fixed '' state ) can be formed. with this understanding, it is perhaps best not to overlook the role that the presence of symmetry play in the dynamics. indeed, if the degrees of freedom of the system are chosen in such a way that the system evolves according to a wilson - devinney model, then symmetry seems to be broken and the dynamics can be seen as an equilibrium process that is driven by the fluctuations of the free energy. the challenge we address in this paper is to examine the extent to which the system as a whole can be described in terms of the so - called _ thermodynamical measures _, that we shall refer to as _ thermodynamic entropy measures_. for this purpose, we study a simplified version of the multi - up - spin model, with the number of spins in the system chosen as _ the _ number of states _ that evolve with the
we report the detection of the highest ionization energy uv / optical line ever detected in a seyfert 2 galaxy. the emission - line spectrum shows no strong evidence of a stellar component, and is clearly the result of scattered continuum radiation from the hidden central source. the coronal line emission is concentrated on the optical hot spot, in contrast to the suggestion that it extends throughout the inner nlr. we have contructured photoionization models of the narrow - line gas and have been able to successfully match nearly all the observed dereddened ratios. assuming that the low ionization gas is screened by a large column absorber, we find that the contribution of highion to the total h@xmath0 flux is 3 times that of lowion. the models also predict a large range of ionization states for the high ionization line gas, such as [ ne v ] @xmath43426, [ fe xiv ] 3084 and [ s xii ] 6731. in addition, the models indicate that a significant population of high ions may arise in the highly ionized clouds, subject to sampling effects. we discuss the physical conditions near the hot spot in ngc 1068. the column density and covering factor of the absorber determined from the models are in reasonable agreement with the observations. if this column has a large covering factor, it will affect the intrinsic anisotropy of the radiation field. it is apparent that the uv and optical emission lines are blueshifted with respect to both the systemic velocity of the host galaxy and the lower ionization lines in these spectra. the lower velocities of other emission - lines may be due to contributions from large - scale molecular clouds along our line of sight, but it is also possible that the high velocity gas is related to the ionization state and/or column density. we note that some of the predicted coronal - line temperatures are slightly below the actual temperatures of the gas. therefore, collisional effects may play a role in the true origin of the lines.
the transition to turbulence is an important long standing problem. it is dominated by the class of non - inflectional turbulent profiles, but also a source of complexity due to the way in which the macroscopic dynamics intrudes into the realm of the classical scenarios of transition to temporal chaos. two approaches have emerged to shed some light on the subject. in the first case, recently proposed _ bifurcation theory _, contributes to a limited set of ` ` critical / exponential '' modes _ governed by the classical transition to _ spatio - temporal chaos_. in the second case, reynolds number @xmath0 ( the type of flow ) is found to determine the threshold below which the system is expected to become intermittuous, i.e. a mixture of a _ laminar _ and a _ turbulent _ state, at least partially. our new approach, based on a spatiotemporal perspective, provides a better understanding of the complexity of the problem and, in turn, leads to an understanding of how the symbolic dynamics associated to that transition enters the description of that process. in particular, it allows one to distinguish _ confined _ systems from _ extended _ systems as soon as the size of the domain is large enough ( extended ) while in a confined system, the transition is discontinuous with exponentially distributed transient lifetimes. as a first application of the theory, we consider the plane couette flow ( pcf ), of late type, which is a prototype of the pcf, and we discuss its relation to the search for _ edge states _ that have been recently observed in a finite dimensional analysis of the ppf. moreover, we make some predictions about the related problem of transitional poiseuille pipe flow. the long - standing problem of the transition to turbulent mass flow in wall flows remains unresolved. i.m. landau - lifshitz - heilbronn institute for theoretical physics, department of physics and astronomy, + university of maryland, college park, md 20742, usa + m. bernoulli institute for nonlinear studies, university of campinas unicamp, campinas univ. paraguay, + lagoas, brazil. + e-mail:`mvela@cc.u-mrs.br ` http://www.uni-montpellier.edu/mriel/muel.html ` + nonlinearity is ubiquitous in the physics of continuous media ( see, e.g., @xcite
we formulate a new explanation of the gravitational shift, which does not require the notion of eigen - time of free - moving atoms. the mass defect concept allows us to account for some shifts, that have not been discussed in the scientific literature. as a first example, we consider the shift of the transition due to an external electric field. we assume that the ion is localized in an rf paul trap, and its center of localization coincides with the origin of a cartesian coordinate system with orthogonal unit vectors @xmath0. we obtain an exact quantum - relativistic expression for the frequency of transition under one - photon absorption and emission, which coincides ( to leading order ) with a well - known result based on general relativity theory @xcite. 2 condensed matter physics, with applications to atomic physics and astronomy, has attracted a great deal of attention recently. one of the most important effects of these condensed matter systems is the recoil effect, which is the nonlinear variation of their energy levels under a time - dependent external field @xcire. this effect is manifested in the clock functions of neutral and charged atoms, and it has been studied both for atoms in optical lattice and those based on trapped ions. because of the translational energy loss due to the interaction with the external potential, the timescale of the localization is not fast, and a measurement of the clock frequency is required to precisely identify the position of the displacement of the free atom. this measurement has been performed both for free and trapped atoms ( atoms in traps ), and the situation with trapped ions ( photons ) has been less clear. although the movement of free atoms is always slow, the acceleration of trapped ions can be approximately described by a two - body hamiltonian, with the momentum of the trapped atom in the stronger confinement region. we have recently developed a new approach to understand the mechanism of gravitational shift which is not compatible with the traditional explanations of the effect in terms of different physical processes involved. the main idea is to take into account the internal energy ( as some continuum ) of a quantum particle, spatially localized in a confined potential, even though the energy of the particle is conserved. this idea was originally developed as part of einstein s theory of relativity, but it was later extended to the einstein - podolsky - rosen theory, which includes time - dilation and causality. this new approach has caught the attention of the scientific community, both theoretically and experimentally. in this work, we will show that the concept of
we present the results of a high resolution ( @xmath0 to 30xmath1 ) imaging survey of nearby edge - on galaxies, the purpose of which is to search for high-@xmath3 dust in absorption against the background stellar light of our target galaxies. this follow - up paper follows from the identification of hundreds of high - resolution ( b and h ) absorbing dust structures seen in the galaxy ngc 891 by howk & savage ( 1997 ). our observations show that the existence of inhomogeneously distributed high - clumped ( clumped ) dust is a common property of spirals, in particular spiral galaxies, with five of the seven galaxies in our final sample showing evidence for such dust structures, none of which show evidence for extraplanar dust structures. there is also a close correlation between the presence of dusty features and dust, as found in current work. the structure of the dust features we discuss appears to be similar to that found in the small magellanic cloud ( dig ) regions of the milky way and in ngc 4302, two of the most luminous and massive spiral galaxies in the local universe. for the final sample of nine galaxies, four of which have measured high-_physical _ column densities in the literature, one has a dust feature with a scale height higher than the galactic midplane, one observes a clumped high-__clump _ clump at a physical resolution of at least 21 kpc from the midplane. we discuss several possible mechanisms that may be responsible for these high - high-#1 dust features, ranging from thermal instabilities in the dust, to harsh dust extinction due to radiation pressure and/or stellar wind / supernova explosions. we conclude, based on the observed clump dust content, that dust must be an important ingredient in the ongoing star formation process in these galaxies. the implications of this result for models of the opacity of the interstellar medium that are commonly used to fit the light profiles of spiral galaxies is briefly discussed.

the detection of dark objects by gravitational microlensing is an application of general relativity effect of gravitational lensing where the separation between the produced images is too small to be appreciated ( @xmath0 arcsec ). we present a project aiming to extend the observations of the potenza toppo telescope towards all the visible targets from from the toppo to ground based observatory in order to detect a larger amount of microlensed events. at present level of our understanding of the galactic structure, our contribution is focused on the analysis of a map of the machos dark matter distribution in the galactic disk and the galactic haloes of the milky way, m31, m33 and dwarf galaxies. the three steps in our project are as follows : 1 ) we select a very bright background star which will be amplified by the lens in such a way that that the event rate is very small. 2 ) we perform a photometric monitoring of the background star. in this way, the amount of light amplification obtained is directly proportional to the number of resolution pixels of the ccd camera. 3 ) we fit a high amplification degenerate paczynski curve to the light curves obtained with the agape and columbia - vatican microlenses. the amplification is then well approximated by a time dependent light amplification of the source which is observable. in fact, when a compact object passes near the line of sight of a background star, the luminosity of this star increases giving rise to a characteristic luminosity curve ( see fig.1 ). this is not very well understood due to the ignorance of the effective content of dark matter and its actual distribution, so the first goal is to search for planets or binary lensing events for which a very accurate photometry is required. our project will provide us with substantially to this aim. this fact will also allow us to investigate in detail the initial stellar mass function as well as the presence of planets ( both jupiter like and earth like ). address = max - planck institut fr gravitation, knigstuhl 17, d-69117 heidelberg, germany, altaddress = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via emilio bianchi 46, i-23807 merate ( lc ), italy

we present new rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) images obtained with the mama camera on the pre - costar hubble space telescope ( hst ) of seven luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs : @xmath0 ) that had already been imaged at other wavelengths by hst. two of the seven galaxies ( vii zw 31 and iras 12112 + 0305 ) are detected in the uv. three additional uligs have also been observed in the near - uv using hst faint object camera ( fov ). combining our new uv and optical images with published far - infrared images of similar galaxies from the iras all - sky survey, we have formed a flux- and luminosity - limited sample of luminous galaxies. in this paper we explore the properties of this uv - bright sample of seven ligs. our main goals are to test whether these galaxies follow the well - known correlation between uv continuum slope ( parametrized by uv spectral slope e(b@xmath1 ) and infrared - excess ( irx ), and to investigate their possible relationships with lyman - break galaxies, the most luminous sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) galaxies, and galaxies at similar redshifts. we find that most of our targets do follow the correlation ; however, we see evidence that very few of the ligs have irx ratios that are consistent with a foreground dust shell model, wherein dust reddening and photometric error are correlated, whereas the majority of the lbgs have uv excesses. the luminosities of our sample are generally agree with those of the lyman break galaxies measured in the far - ir, though we can not rule out very high luminosity ( at least a factor of few less luminous than the best - studied lbgs ). our results suggest that a significant fraction of the star formation in the early universe occurred in obscured galaxies of all colors, and that while these galaxies have similar total infrared - to - optical luminosity ratios ( seds ), they likely have significantly different total luminosity distributions shortward of the fir peak. we also show that the mid - infrared ( 1500 ) to near - ir spectral energy distributions of our seven targets are similar to those of some ultraluminous ir galaxies, with seds that fall along the same trend as those of high - redshift galaxies, even though our uv data reach only a few hundred pc in projection.
we report new results on three intriguing radio - bright neutron star candidates which we initially identified as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) with a rotation period of @xmath0 s and unusual radio properties including a fast spin - down rate and a highly modulated pulse shape. all three objects have been found to be associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ). the new results obtained with the _ asca _ _ and _ rosat _ _ telescopes provide definitive evidence that these axps were born as rapidly rotating pulsars spinning rapidly, spinning down at rates similar to, or faster than, the crab pulsar. in the case of the, we find a pulsar counterpart to the crab, but a more intriguing result is that this pulsar also has a pulse shape similar to the pulsar in the, but its light curve is better described by a steady pulsar rather than a rapidly rotating one. this lends support to the scenario in which these xps are born as accretion powered pulsars, rather than being the remnant neutron stars of a type ii / ib supernova explosion. the origin of the 7 s pulsar remains uncertain. it may be a member of a growing class of radio - quiet pulsars which form a class of ` ` isolated pulsars '' that are characterized by fast rotation rates, slow spins, and lack of significant stochastic variability. however, like for the kes73 pulsar, there is no obvious indication of a binary companion to this neutron star. if so, it would support the hypothesis that all radio pulsars are born in supernova explosions. we also report a discovery of another axp - like object, 1e 2259 + 586, in the center of the snr ctb109. this source is extremely radio - luminous, has a steep spectrum, and is likely an underlaying shell - type snr ; if confirmed, it will be one of the coolest neutron stars known.
the state - of - the - art for diatom - diatom collisions has been improved through the computation of a high - level potential energy surface, robust surface fitting, and full - dimensional inelastic dynamics with full angular momentum coupling. this approach has been benchmarked against experiment for pure rotational and rovibrational transitions within the experimental uncertainties and unknowns. the accuracy and long - range behavior of the proposed energy surface is found to be comparable to previous, lower - dimensional surfaces. the application of the 6d rigid - rotor approximation resolves a long - standing discrepancy between previous calculations and experimental data. state - to - state and total cross sections for collisions with ortho - h@xmath0, @xmath1, are presented. these have been obtained using the most accurate possible basis set and idealized assumption of full four - dimensional dynamics. the quenching of co, with reference to vibrational excitation, is reported here for the first time. this study highlights the importance of modeling of protoplanetary disks in the context of cold gas kinematics and disk evolution in that zone where planets are expected to be forming. the examination of the co fundamental band is a tracer of warm gas in the innermost regions of ppds and, with appropriate modeling, gives insight into disk - gas dynamics and disk formation zone. a recent survey of 69 ppds with the vlt @xcite has revealed co vibrational bands in 77 % of the sources including @xcotically significant bands in 41 objects. the study of the six - dimensional ( 6d ) v6d potential reveals the existence of an important quasi - resonant population of modes, which dominates the initial state distribution of co. these modes give rise to correlated, correlated valence effects which have significant impact on the energy, spin, and spin spectra of the planets in the ppd population. the current computations agree well with the observed vis - a - vis analysis of the 4d v12 pes.

the surface tension and the mean field of nuclei are calculated in newtonian gravity. the density of nucleons in heavy nuclei is assumed to be constant. we show that it follows from the fact that the attractive potential, pauli s exclusion principle and the repulsive hard core potential are all constant. our claim is essentially based on self consistency arguments. we do not require any ergodicity or thermodynamic equillicity for the constancy. but, it is important. = 0.25 in = 6.5 in = -0.2 in = 1.2 cm = -1.5 cm''' '' '' + * surface tension in nuclei * + newton - birkhoff theorem * + p.j. bellow + _ department of physics, university of southampton, + southampton so17 1bj, u.k. _ + @xmath0e - mail : bellow@southampton.ac.uk _ + the surface tension is the free energy per unit mass of a nucleon in a heavy nucleus. it is calculated by taking the ratio of the kinetic energy of the nucleons to the potential energy of a spherical spherical ball. + theorem ( part - i ) : the potential at any point on the surface of a spherically symmetric ball of mass @xif0 ( at centre of the spherical ball ) for any value of nuclear charge, should consist of two parts. the first part is due to the zero point energy and the second part is caused by the presence of the hard core. + the theorem is a very special case of the newton birkff - schrdinger equation. it generalizes the classical theory of gravitation. + in part - ii we calculate the total force, vortices and so forth as a function of the radius of the nucleus and of the sphere surrounding the point. we recover the theorem for finite spherical shells. however, our calculations are exact only in the limit of nuclear matter. for finite nuclei, however heavy it may be, volume occupied by nucleons will be a bit larger than the spherical centre of hard core radii. + conclusion : + the numerical value of surface tension shows the validity of the theorem.
we present the results from a statistical analysis of 25 _ asca _ observations of 24 radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars ( rqqs ) from the _ rosat _ bright quasar survey ( pg - survey ). the sample is statistically - complete and covers the range @xmath0 in the 0.710 kev ( observed frame ) band. all but two objects were detected. we found 15 of the 24 detected objects to have the counts high enough that we were able to perform an analysis of their variability. we find the fraction of sources with x - ray luminosity greater than 10@xmath1, is in agreement with that found for low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies and is lower than in the high x - luminosity sample of qsos. the best - fitting values of the effective hydrogen column density for all 24 objects is very similar to that derived for the low - redshift sample of pg 1 galaxies. the mean photon index and the standard errors of the interval between 0.510 and 0.5 can be fitted by a range of different values of ( 0.20.4 & 0.50.0 ), with a standard error of ( 1.00.2 - 1.0)dex at the 95 % confidence level. the spectra of all the detected objects can be adequately described by a single power law ( model a ) or a two power law with significant deviations. model b provides an adequate description of the time - averaged spectra in the 210 kev band for all but one object ( pg 1411 + 442 ). we were unable to find a suitable model for the remaining 10 objects. the remaining 7 datasets ( 11 detected objects ) were found to have a power law continuum with significant attenuation ( model c ). in 11 cases it was found that the emission was a gaussian with a flattening or a double power law component. our preferred model of an intrinisic broad emission line is consistent with the results of tanaka, inoue & holt ( 1994 ) in which is thought to be intrinsic absorption in the highest luminosity qso. the inclusion of a broad, gaussian emission line significantly improved the overall spectral energy distribution of 11 datasets for 11 datasets. for the 9 datasets in which we are confident of the presence of infinisic absorption, we find an equivalent width of 0.51.0 ev and a mean line energy of 23.6 kev. our results are consistent with those presented in
we study the reionization of the universe by means of a monte carlo radiative transfer scheme using a combination of high resolution cosmological simulations and particle hydrodynamics ( sph ). an important refinement is made by the proper treatment of feedback effects ranging from the mechanical energy injection to the h@xmath0 photodissociation of radiation produced by massive stars. as an example of application of our approach, we study the evolution of a stellar source of a total mass @xmath1 turning on at @xcite, located at a node of the cosmic web. the study includes a spectral energy distribution of a zero - metallicity stellar population, and two initial mass functions ( salpeter / larson ) ; the spatial density distribution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is deduced from high resolution simulations described below. the initial conditions are produced with the cosmics code adopting a normalization @xfig2 for the power spectrum. the studies are performed in isolation, using a particle mass resolution of 15 kpc ( comoving ), and in full mass resolution with a coarse resampling of the most external particles. in the hi - resolution ( central ) region the number of particles is 2313847, whereas the rebinning left us with 10008 particles of variable mass ( increasing with distance from the center ) in a shell shell shell. we evolve this initial matter distribution with the gadget gadget ( springel, yoshida & white 2000 ), a parallel n - body tree - tree - to - tree scheme to that used to treat hydrodynamic processes. the process of packet emission and absorption are then treated statistically by randomly sampling the appropriate distribution function. we derive the temporal evolution of the particles involved in the process and we evaluate the propagation of the ionizing photons through the central cubic regions of the simulation. the results are in good agreement with previously published simulations. we discuss the possible difficulties faced by the adopted methods and we have compared them with the methods recently developed by gnedin, abel & madau ( 2000 ). -2truecm # 1 # 1#1 # 1 2sr_2 2m_2sr_1 # 110^#1 2n_2
we investigate the conditions on a tensor for a given algebraic type in higher dimensions. in particular, we use an analysis of the discriminants of the associated characteristic equation to determine the necessary conditions for the weyl and ricci tensors ( and hence the higher dimensional riemann curvature tensor ) to be of algebraic types * ii * or * d*. we are consequently able to determine necessary conditions in terms of simple scalar polynomial curvature invariants. in addition, the analysis can be used to determine conditions on the eigenvalue structure of the curvature operator up to degeneracies. the resulting syzygies can then be written as special scalar impurity solutions of the characteristic equation. we illustrate the usefulness of this approach by using a number of simple examples, including a four - dimensional rotating black ring, a five - dimensional pure einstein space, and a space with complex hyperbolic sections. # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

the 450/850-@xmath0 m emission of the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera is used to estimate the intensity of the background radiation following a merger between galaxies of different redshifts. we present a simple model of hierarchical galaxy formation, which incorporates the effects of obscuration by dust, and investigate the properties of the scuba galaxies as luminous infrared - luminous merger systems. the global luminosity density from high - redshift galaxies is inferred to exceed that deduced from observations in the rest - frame ultraviolet and optical wavebands by up to an order of magnitude. the source counts and background radiation intensity in the far - infrared and near - infrared wavebands are reproduced adequately in the model without introducing a large number of parameters. the counts of galaxies detected in the near- infrared and optical wavesbands, and the associated background radiation intensities in these wavebands, are consistent if about 4 times more energy is emitted by galaxies after being reprocessed into the far- infrared waveband by interstellar dust as radiated directly in the optical / ultraviolet waveband. in order to account for the observed abundance of distant galaxies detected at 175 and 850 @xmath1 m using _ iso _ and scuba, the mass - to - light ratio of a typical galaxy merger must be decreased by a factor of about 10 and 200 over the observed redshift range of 3. also, the cosmic star formation rate associated with merging haloes must evolve more rapidly and rapidly with redshift than with conventional star formation in a cosmological setting. lastly, the model predicts that the fraction of gas converted into stars and fed into agn uniformly more efficiently and rapidly in mergers at low redshift is large, but does not describe the associated star formation activity strongly. a more detailed description of star formation and agn fuelling can be found in numerical simulations of the appearance of luminous mergers. cosmology : observations galaxies : evolution galaxies : formation infrared : galaxies infrared : stars.
we consider the problem of construction of a second basic object, that is, a basic object whose windows are not linked by interior edges, and of subsequent introduction of additional windows. this problem is motivated by the fact that the first basic object does not contain degenerate segments of degree @xmath0, and the difficulty of finding the solution of it is because the nodes that form the windows are connected to a larger number of nodes in the graph that can not form windows themselves. in this paper, we solve this problem by means of two subproblems that are equivalent, according to the complexity of the first object, called a hamiltonian cycle and a selection of common contour edges. the first problem consists of the assignment of a node to the contour edge of an object, such that the edge of the edge assigned to the window is the same 0 weight as its edge. this requires a complete set of algorithms that perform the following two steps : ( i ) rearrange all interior edges of the object so that the interior of the second object is no more than one edge at a time ; ( ii ) search for a node that can move to one of the interior edges by a single search for the edge that moves to the interior ; and ( iii ) decide whether the new node belongs to the free edges or to the degenerate edges. this last task is very difficult, and takes place on the level of ` ` branches '' of the graph. it is known that the branch and bound methods are the most universal and effective ones for np problems. to date, no algorithms have been found that are able to solve this particular np problem in polynomial time. we suggest that future developments in this area, based on the techniques developed in the recent years, provide us with an opportunity to overcome this difficulty and to obtain an answer to the question : can we overcome np - completeness with the help of such algorithms? the success of the algorithms we offer here is not based on any progression to a better solution. our example indicates that this possibility is real, and that the accuracy of our solution of the problem can be determined by further improvements in the algorithms used.
the axion is a hypothetical pseudoscalar particle first introduced in the qcd sector of the standard model to solve the strong cp problem. the vacuum realignment mechanism makes the axion prone to spontaneous decay. the two most important mechanisms to produce axion dark matter are the peccei - quinn symmetry broken at large separations and the vacuum renormalization group mechanism starts production immediately after the end of inflation. under very general conditions, the universe after inflation is dominated by a massive decaying scalar field, down to the reheating temperature @xmath0. axions may account for the totality of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) observed. the dark matter axion parameter space is modeled by the combination of the misalignment mechanism and string decays. we review the production of cold axions in standard cosmology and non - standard cosmologies. the perturbative expansion of the universe before bbn is needed to cover the gap between the cosmological models before and after bbn. we discuss how these changes might be tested in the upcoming baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements, the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ), and supernova ( sn ) measurements. epsf.sty # 1#2#3acta. phys. pol. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 acta phys. slovaca ( # 1 ) ( # 2 in # 3)phys. rev. lett. * # 1 *,#2(#3)#1#2 # 3 ann. rev. astron. astrophys. # 1 ( 19#3 ) # 2 hep - ph/0209004 aue-02 - 02/03 + dcpt/02/03 * robert fleischer, nicola serra and niels tuning * _ instituto de fsica corpuscular c.s.i.c./universitat de valncia + edificio de institutos de paterna, p.o. box 1663, 56100 burjassot, spain _ _ cern, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + * dept. of physics and astronomy, chinese academy of sciences + k. y. kim + _ department of physics, massachusetts institute of technology, cambridge, ma 02138, usa _ + e - mail : robert.fischer@ct.edu +
we study the phase diagram and structure of the kugel - khomskii bilayer spin - orbital model for a perovskite lattice with nearly degenerate @xmath0 orbitals in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations on the interlayer bonds. the model is solved by a cluster mean - field approach which includes beyond the single site mf a finite - size cubic cluster coupled to its neighbors by cluster quantum fluctuations. this approach provides a transparent and rather complete picture of the possible ordered and disordered phases in the model. gapless ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations and on - site quantum fluctuations are used to establish the type of spin and orbital order and distinguish between first and second order phase transitions, which are characterized by characteristic features of their order parameters. in all the discussed phases we find that one finds a variety of stable valence - bond ( vb ) like phases, characterized by either long - range af or thie joint order. among them, we find the most stable vb phase with dominant local orbital correlation, stable only at very high temperatures where the amorphous bond correlations are strong and favorable for the eso - epvb transition. we also find a phase with significant orbital degeneracy which is stabilized at high temperatures by a crystal field, and study its stable phases by analyzing their structure and dynamics. in the region of phase diagram space we find an intermediate configuration, where two such phases with vb order coexists with fo@xmath1 orbitals, one obtained from an exact diagonalization of a single - site cubic cluster and the other from a bethe - peiss solution. in this phase the cleavage of the orbitals appears and stabilizes this type of phase. the interesting fact that this phase is stabilized by a finite crystal field is introduced explicitly by quantum fluctuations, which dramatically changes its character from the one found in the earlier 3d model, suggesting a crucial role in the entanglement of the vb states in the present bilayer system. pacs numbers : 74.25.dw, 74.20.eh, 75.20.-q, 74c-, 05.50.+q 2

we simulate the tunneling process of a single particle moving in a double - well potential using the digital quantum simulation method. as a small - scale experiment, we present a tunneling simulation on two- and three - qubit nmr quantum information processors with state - of - the - art molecular structures of chloroform and diethyl - fluoromalonate, which can be implemented with only a few qubits. by combining the experimental results with theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that quantum tunneling, a fundamental quantum simulation task, can be successfully performed with these quantum computers. with the help of a quantum fourier transformation operator, our experiments have revealed the amazing power of the qubits and the promising future of quantum simulations. tunneling is one of the most fundamental concepts derived from quantum theory, which describes a many - body phenomenon where a physical system is placed in a potential, and the outcome of the interaction between the particles can be computed with minimal dissipation. the origin of this phenomenon can be traced back to the simple interaction between a particle and the potential wells of the well in the potential, where the quantum phenomenon of tunneling can be observed as an in - well oscillation of the particle @xcite. however, the experimental realization of this fundamental process has been not possible so far, because of the challenge of transporting the particle from one well to the other and inseca large - scale potentials, which are usually too small. it is therefore of paramount importance to simulate this quantum phenomenon with a high level of accuracy. the path - integral method, which has been successfully used for the simulation of quantum information, has opened up a new avenue for the study of the fundamental processes of quantum theory in condensed matter. quantum simulations with qubits, which could potentially revolutionize the fields of quantum computation and condensed matter physics, has been a challenge for the past twenty years. this challenge has led to the development of remarkable technologies for quantum simulation, which may pave the way towards the field of quantum optimal control, and will probably be able to outperform the classical computers in many simulation tasks, such as quantum error correction, quantum simulations, and quantum teleportation. the success of quantum computers can be accredited to the end scientists, technologists, and mathematicians, who have achieved tremendous success in their fields of research in this area. in particular, the quantum computer as a building block for the next generation quantum computers is the quantum information processor ( qip ), which will be based on the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) effect

we show that the ` ` ` empowerment '' of an agent can be used to guide an agent towards a more efficient strategy of behavior in complex and difficult environments. specifically, we show that for a certain class of continuous control problems, using the structure of the state - space of interest ( for example, the game of soccer ), empowerment provides a natural utility measure which imbues the agent with an a priori value which allows the agent to quickly discover ( and thus efficiently explore ) salient features of the environment of interest. in the finite - state domain, we empirically compute the value of empowerment for every state of the system and find that it is a non - negative function of the total number of successor states the agent can reach with high success. this quantity, which we call _ empowerment _, is a generalization of the concept of _ mobility _ and was originally introduced by bennett _ et al. _ to describe the heuristic of artificial intelligence. our research embraces the related ideas of self - organization and self - regulation, where we aim for complex behavior to derive from simple and generic internal rules. as an application of this, we study the problem of regression and model learning : using empowerment to guide a robot or other artificial agent in the exploration of a noisy environment. we first develop a formal definition of empowerment and give an algorithm for its computation based on monte - carlo approximation of the underlying high - dimensional integrals. we then apply this approach to model learning and show that it can lead to exponential growth in the quality of simulated human choices in a transparent way. in particular, by greedily choosing actions that lead to the highest empowered states, we can obtain a seemingly goal - driven behavior. we investigate empirically how empowerment is used to optimally score states for reinforcement learning. we find that high - empowerment states lead to more efficient and interesting behavior without resorting to specialized, hand - designed solutions that vary from task to task. thus, we establish empowerment as a guiding factor for a variety of human behavior.
we study the electronic structure of the recently reported zigzag antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state of na@xmath0iro-1 using the hse+soc calculation. besides the calculated band structure and density of states, the functional containing the over - delocalized spin - orbit correlations ( sie ) and the spin singlet excitation ( sse ) are also calculated and optimized to obtain a good match to the experimentally observed afm structure. we find that, using the optimized hse structure, the observed insulating gap of @xmath140.34 ev is well reproduced by not only taking into account the soc but also correcting the sie inherent in the lda or the gga. the energetic role of the soc is elucidated in our study by opening the band gap by increasing the ir - to - o distance. furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of soc leads to the development of a new paramagnetic insulating phase, which is metallic with a small ir magnetic moment but still exhibits a slater - type itinerant magnetism. our results indicate a possible transfer from the metallic to the paramagnetic phase through itinerant ferromagnetism. * insulating and paramagnetic phases are among the most fascinating phenomena in physics found in this decade. in the last decade, there has been great progress in understanding and predicting the physics of these phases. in particular, considerable attention has been devoted to the study of the topological properties of the exotic solids such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) and silicon carbide ( carbide ). a considerable amount of work has been done on fine - tuning the kitaev - heisenberg and fermi - liquid model of the electrons, atoms, ions, and molecules, but very little is known about the nature of the magnetic phases in realistic materials. one of the most interesting issues in this respect is whether the physics applies to all the mott - orbit materials or only to the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) materials. in this question, the physics community has contributed enormously to the search for the phase diagram and the order parameter of these materials @xcite. on the other hand, it is still unclear what the physics is exactly about these materials, and how the physics relates to the observed exotic magnetism in these materials. quite recently, a number of experimental and theoretical works have been reported for a strong suppression of the ir magnetic moments in the vicinity of a charge density wave, which supports a sl
i revisit the ` ` graviton picture '', a model of gravity which employs the ad - hoc assumption that gravitation is mediated by virtual particles gravitons with non - zero mass. in particular, i consider a simple dynamical system composed of a luminous point - like mass orbited by a quasi - massless test particle with circular speed @xmath0 in a circular orbit. the latter is in tension with the standard assumption that the range of gravity is infinite. as a result, any model of modified gravity begins with a census of the essential boundary conditions that need to be incorporated ; this may be viewed as a direct consequence of milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ). the assumption that massive particles ( also referred to as massive gravity ) are assumed to be massless leads to problems of two fundamental observations : firstly, the density of the universe follows an inverse square - of - distance law, and second, the mass discrepancy acceleration ( mda ) relation of disk galaxies is a strong anti - correlation between gravitational field strength and the ratio of dynamical and luminous masses. in the latter case, i argue that all data from all galaxies falling on the same curve ( within measurement uncertainties ) can be identified with the _ virial mass _ of a stellar system comprising luminous mass plus apparent phantom dark matter halo such that ( i ) the dark matter is small compared to the baryonic tully - fisher and faber - jackson relations, ( ii ) the mda relation is in good agreement with the observed one, and ( iii ) the existence of a strong virial radius is universal. in this paper i explore the implications of these assumptions for the dynamics of dark matter. i conclude that mond does indeed provide a new way to describe gravity on scales larger than a few kiloparsecs ; however, graviton graviton interactions are strongly suppressed in this model, which may have important consequences for cosmology.
in this work, the _ fermi_/lat very high - energy ( vhe ; e @xmath0100 gev ) source list is published. a systematic cross - correlation study is performed between the vhe counterparts detected using the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iacts ) of each source in the list, and the gev to tev spectra of several selected coincident sources. the results of this study reveal that a significant fraction of the lat very high energy sources are spatially coincident with a vhe counterpart. this fraction is much higher than in the third egret catalogue, for which a simple coincidence is considered. this result confirms that the sample of lat sources that have been selected on the basis of spatial coincidence is composed of very bright sources, that includes both obscured and bright snr / pwn candidates, and sources without obvious counterparts at lower energy bands. the luminosity of these sources is not controlled by the lat instrument, and it is not clear that their bolometric luminosities differ from those of the h.e.s.s. sources in the same source class. those sources that are classified as extragalactic ( all agn and the large magellanic cloud ) are not considered below. the total number of lat vhe sources detected in the tev band is 205. based on three months of observations ( august 4, 2008 ), aip conference proceedings ( 1085 *, 219 chaves, r. c. and c. g. 2008e ), reports on progress in physics ( 221 international gamma - ray astrophysics conference, gold coast, australia, 2009 ), and new vhe source candidates identified with lat, the virgo observatory ( for tev studies ), are reported for the first time. * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * desy 09 - 170 september 2009 @xsmath1-ray astronomy and astrophysics department, technische universiteit eindhoven, + p.o. box 513, 5600 mains, d-85748 mnchen, germany * notkestrasse 85 - 22607 hamburg *
we present a low - energy @xmath0 supersymmetric framework for electroweak and strong interactions in which the standard model ( sm ) is embedded in a hyper and vector multiplet with tree - level higgs quartic couplings. we study the mirror fermion spectrum as well as other phenomenological aspects of the theory. the weak - scale scale is understood to be that of the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the global theory, which is phenomenologically unfavorable, in general, from destabilization at the quantum level. the four generations of heavy fermions ( especially the top quark ) are naturally explained by the heaviness of the third generation mirror top. a toy model with an abelian flavor symmetry implies that very small violations of mirror parity may also play a role in the smallness of neutrino masses. we explore various low energy limits of the model, including the allowed spectrum of new particles, mirror leptons, and neutrinos. the lightest heavy quark ( the mirror top ) is shown to be almost stable and its spectrum is well described by the see - saw mechanism. we also demonstrate that it is possible to have a heavy and highly mixed ordinary and mirror top quarks simultaneously with a relatively light ( and relatively non - mixed ) sm bottom quark. the mirror symmetry is then determined by the mixing between the sm and its third generation models and we find that this sees - saw mixing is forbidden ( if mirror parity is broken ), although metastable modes can be permitted for a limited range of values of the sm scale. we estimate, however, that the small masses of the light mirror top and bottom quarks could still be allowed if mpv mixing is allowed. we discuss the consequences of these considerations for the discovery potential of the next generation of heavy, mirror - rich, hadron colliders. 6.5 in 9.0 in -0.25truein 0.30truein doe / er/4071736 + ctp - tamu-58/9 + act-17/96 + hep - ph/9611437 * andrzej j. buras,@xmath1 theory at weak scales : a review * 0.3 cm optik school of physics, tata institute for advanced study, + 1, homi bhabha road, mumbai 400 005, india. + e - mail : stazjt@hznu.ac.in
we compile distances to 61 photospheric radius expansion bursts observed by rossi et al. ( 2005 ). we find that the median distance to the galactic centre for the 61 systems with peak luminosities in excess of the eddington limit is 9.0 kpc, with an excess of stars in the range 10 - 15 m@xmath0. these stars are found to be persistent and ten times more massive than neutron stars of the same spectral type. there also appear to be more than twice as many low mass x ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the galactic halo as in their galactic counterparts. we investigate the implications for their galactic distribution and the galactic population of ultra luminous x ray sources ( ulxs ). using the bh peak luminosity as a distance indicator we find no evidence for a difference in the l and bh lmxb distributions. we determine the best value of the system parameters ( orbital period, roche lobe radius, inclination, and mass function ) using the currently available measurements of the atoll source 4u 172834 and find that it is inconsistent with a model in which the system is located in the dark matter halo a distance of 1025 pc. we also determine the mean density of the neutron star donor, based on the observed period and radius distribution. this gives a system radius of 9.1 kpc and a mass function of 2.2 @xmath1. the neutron stars in our sample appear to have a higher mean mass than the black holes in the halo for which a dynamical mass estimate is derived. using both these results and a new normalisation of the radio x ray correlation in the low / hard state, we propose a distance scale for the galactic ulxs. finally, we compare the spatial distributions of neutron stars and black holes with the distances estimated using the kinematics of interstellar gas in the vicinity of sources where the x ray emission is anisotropic ( i.e. in the case of atoll sources there is a kick at birth ).

we investigate the properties of a sample of powerful radio - loud agn host galaxies ( r - agn ) from the sdss main galaxy survey, using data from the sloan digital sky survey and the nrao vla sky survey. we define radio luminosity in the range @xmath0whz@xmath1 and use the definition of de vaucouleurs effective radius to compare with the values found for control samples of the same luminosity. we find a significant cluster of galaxies with large blue cores and diffuse red light, which is not resolved by our observations. this may be evidence of a link between the radio agn activity and the star formation in the central regions of the host galaxies. we also find a higher fraction of radio galaxies harbouring small blue cores, which may be associated withagn feedback. we complement our optical study with spectroscopic observations of a control sample of normal early - type galaxies, to investigate the distribution of agn light in radio galaxies and their respective control samples. we use a bayesian likelihood analysis to compare the average values from the two samples. the results are consistent with each other and indicate that the radio galaxies are intrinsically redder than the control galaxies. however, we find that the distributions of red and blue light are significantly different in the control and radio samples, which can not be explained by differences in intrinsic agn - to - control ratio. our analysis defines a complete sample of 1,200 radio galaxies with homogeneous morphologies and redshifts which are hosted by elliptical galaxies on the optical, infrared and radio axes. this sample is best suited to a star formation model, where galaxies lie on the locus defined by the virgo and shapley imfs. our results also suggest that it may not be a reliable way to determine the radio properties of galaxies, particularly in the presence of radio sources.

we consider a joint downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) transmission model, where the set of aps jointly serve a set of distributed mobile users ( mus ), where comp based joint transmit / receive processing ( beamforming ) is employed for dl / ul transmissions. under this setup, we study a joint dl and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design problem to minimize the total energy consumption in the c - ran. in particular, we address the energy consumption ( including both transmission and non - transmission related portions ) jointly with a minimal subset of active aps, by assuming that the backhaul transport network is provisioned with sufficiently large capacity. given finite backhaul capacity, the optimal strategy for backhaul compression and quantization has been studied recently in e.g. @xcite. prior to this work, only the dl transmission has been considered in the literature, and the prior studies have all considered mu association and/or active ap selection problems for various objectives from a dl perspective. in this paper, for the purpose of exposition, we consider linear precoding and decoding for both dl ( through gso ) and ul ( via rip ) transmissions, respectively, which is jointly designed at the bbu pool assuming the perfect channel knowledge for all mus. the new challenges include the optimization of the power consumption between aps and mus due to the different transmit power levels of mus, and of the number of radio links used to communicate between the two aps. in order to address these challenges, we establish a virtual downlink transmission for the experiment, and determine the transmit beamforming vectors ( to use at the multi - antenna aps ) of the original ul transmission. subsequently, we propose three different algorithms : gso, rip, and sum - power optimization, which reduce the problem to two sub - problems, i.e., dl versus ul dl optimization and ul versus gso optimization. various simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithms.
in the framework of a coarse - grained nonlinear network model ( nnm ), we investigate energy transfer in proteins. in particular, we find that spatially localized band - edge normal modes ( nm ) can be continued from low energies to db solutions, where the db self - promotes itself to increase the overlap between the two db sites. furthermore, we show that energy transfer can occur between widely separated positions, up to 60 % of the kick energy, if the frequency of one db is significantly less than that of the other. in rhodopsin, however, only a small fraction of the energy transferred to the nm site ends up in the retinal chromophore. thus, we conclude that the db excitation is most likely to occur within the stiffest part of protein structures, within the @xmath0-carbons sequence of amino acids involved in catalytic processes. protein structures are known to be designed to allow energy to flow where it is needed, _ e.g. _ to, or close to catalytic sites, with the aim of lowering the energy barriers that have to be overcome during catalytic events. for instance, in the myosin protein, an all - site kick experiment reveals that the high - yield and long - range energy transfers systematically pin energy at the sites the most involved in a small subset of band - edges ; that is, at the nm sites of potential energy bottlenecks. this observation has implications for potential applications of the nnm framework in the field of protein engineering. recent studies have shown that dna ribosebs ( dbs ) are highly site - modulated. as a consequence, they can ` ` jump '' to another site as their energy is varied, following spatial selection rules matching the pattern of dbs localized within the same domain @xcite. indeed, as a matter of fact, such jumps result in a db localized at the same location. this strongly suggests that energy transfers not only target stiff regions, but can couple any two sites efficiently only through rather stiff channels.
we present a merger model study of two main - sequence stars, i.e. a binary, having a hydrogen mass ratio of @xmath0, and a common envelope. the merger is modeled as an ad - dominated hierarchical evolution with some assumptions : the evolutionary stages of both components are : ( i ) the time from a binary contact to coalescence ; ( ii ) the matter of the secondary is homogeneously mixed with that of the primary beyond the core - envelope transition point which is, respectively, separates the core and the envelope of the mass donor ; ( iii ) the system mass is conserved. the evolutionary scenarios considered in this paper are those of nelson & eggleton. we construct the merger models for three cases : ad, as, and ad. cases as, ar and ad are defined at the hydrogen mass fraction of the merger. in all cases, we assume that one or both components have left the main sequence. in case ad, we find that the merger products are the remnants of binaries with masses, transferred from the other side of the central mergers, but with absolute magnitudes that are still near the equilibrium values obtained in ( a ), ( b ) and ( c ). in each case, we consider the evolution of the companion stars as being main sequence stars and compare their merger timescales with observations. most of the mergers are triggered by magnetic braking implying that the braking effect is very small for the kind of binaries studied here. the aml effect is negligible for the ad and as models, however, there are still some deviations from observed data in the sense that the two models deviate from observational data in some regions of the evolutionary tracks. these deviations can be explained by the central hydrogen mass fractions deviating from observed values. in most of our models, the merger product is the product of a short - lived evolutionary phase of the two parent stars, after which time the system returns to thermal equilibrium and begins normal evolution. the models also explain the observed colour distribution of low - mass blue stragglers in w uma.

we present nebular imaging and spectroscopy of the central 500 pc of the luminous infrared galaxy m82 obtained with the 3d observatory s spitzer space telescope and the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) of the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik ( mpe ) instrument. our data cover the entire region mapped in detail over a region @xmath0 in size and over a hundred parsecs in radius, and enable us to characterize the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ), the composition of the stellar populations ( hot massive and cool evolved stars ), and the relative distribution of the gas clouds and stellar clusters. we derive physical parameters ( electron density, gas - phase abundances, and ionization parameter ) and constraints on the star formation history in the central regions of m82, taking into account the contributions from additional continuum sources ( hot dust, ob stars, nebular free - free and free - bound processes ) as well as the extinction towards the evolved stars. we apply photoionization models to constrain the average effective temperature of the ob stars and to investigate the metallicity of the evolved stellar population. the abundances of carbon, oxygen, neon, and magnesium are consistent with solar values, while a deficiency of iron is indicated by the lack of photospheric absorption features in the ob star population. we confirm that the excitation state of the nebular gas is remarkably similar across the starburst core, on all spatial scales, from the small - scale concentrations of condensations at the nucleus to the supermassive black holes at the interface between the stellar bar and molecular cloud regions. we find that the photoionizing properties of the nebulae are sensitive to the spatial offset of the ionizing sources from the major axis, in the sense that the strongest ionizing photons are emitted furthest from the nucleus and in the most extended regions. the spatial variation of the level of ionization and of the hot dust emission indicates a rate of star formation efficiency similar to that observed in m82 s most recent star - forming regions. however, our results also suggest a possible evolutionary advantage of optical - selected samples in selecting local stellar populations, in particular young, metal - poor populations.
we present a new compilation of the thermonuclear reaction rates, called nacre, related to the baryonic parameter, which extends the previous compilation by caughlan and fowler ( 1988 ). the nacre compilation covers all the major reactions involved in primordial nucleosynthesis up to the last stable orbit. for each reaction, detailed references are provided to the source of original data. the rates are evaluated in tabular form and their uncertainties are analyzed. predictions for the cosmological abundances of several isotopes are given. the abundance of the light element @xmath0 is included in the compilation for the first time. we present the results of the analysis of the present data and discuss the astrophysical status of each isotope, both observationally and theoretically. in order to confront the present calculation with the theoretical calculations, we evaluate the sensitivity of the different light element abundances to the change of the relevant reaction rates ; bbn calculations are performed using i ) recommended values of the reaction rates and ii ) extreme values obtained from the low and high rate limits. we confirm that the recent very high accuracy of the lrg smacetimes measurements in halo stars and in the small magellanic cloud leads to a relatively large uncertainty in the amount of dark matter. the dark matter in the form of dark massive compact objects is estimated to be about 20 % in agreement with the limits given by lasserre et al ( 2000 ). on the other hand, the uncertainties on the primordial abundances are dominated by the result of the uncertain nuclear cross sections for a few isotopes and a few key observables. a careful examination of the dependences on the nuclear cross section leads to the conclusion that a very high level of uncertainty still remains to be obtained. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) = cmr10 = cmbx10 scaled 2 to 2.0truecmr9 * updated cosmology with the new nuclear astrophysics compilation * * s. fritsch, n. kaiser, w. weise + _ dipartimento di fisica, universit degli studi di milano - bicocca, + p.za l. da vinci 32, i-20133 milano, italy _ + e. mail : nkaiser@uni-milano.it _ + s. dodorico, v. vauclair, d. charbonnel, m.
we extend previous work showing that correlations between bolometric dust luminosities and rest - frame uv, sub - mm, radio, mid - ir, and radio fluxes can be used to estimate the star - formation rates of high - redshift galaxies. in the first part of this paper we show that the fluxes of actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 can be estimated from their uv colors using well - established correlations calibrated in the local universe. but the far - ir and radio backgrounds are notoriously difficult to measure, and measurements of their fluxes at these wavelengths have only been carried out recently. here we show, however, that a large fraction of the energy emitted by massive stars radiates in regions of the universe that are optically thick to uv radiation. in these regions radiation is efficiently absorbed by dust, making it effective at obscuring much of the starlight that is emitted by these galaxies. as a result most of the optical and near - ir excesses recently reported by _ iras _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys can be accurately modeled without direct measurements of the dust s spectrum. instead they are explained by correlations between the dust obscuration ( as measured by the ratio of the expected dust column density to the column density of starlight ) and the galaxy luminosity. in our second paper we re - examine the previously poorly - studied correlation between dust obscuring and luminosity, and estimate the scatter in cases where it has not been previously done. we find that the correlation is robust for galaxies at all redshifts if their bolomets are selected from a well - defined set of surveys that operate over a wide range of wavelengths. for example, we show using our uv - selected sample that half of the galaxies in our sample are expected to have blackbody temperatures above 50k, which is not ruled out in the current surveys. the third paper tests the reliability of these correlations in the context of the current ( poorly - defined ) far - infrared and radio surveys. it is found that their predicted fluxes through the four well - studied atmospheric windows are unlikely to be correlated. these results suggest that either there is a significant shortfall in the number and energy budget of star formation at high redshift in galaxies with only a small contribution from known populations, or that new surveys have yet to detect the majority of the luminous star formation that is important for the rest of redshift population. # 1to 0pt#1 # 1
we present the first results of the modulation of galactic cosmic rays ( gcs ) with solar activity, from a numerical approach. the modulation is calculated using a gaussian random variation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 with a rate of 19 %. the solar activity data together with the gcs from the wilcox solar laboratory ( wsvc ) allow us to evaluate the time needed for a cr to reach the earth, for different variations of the solar magnetic field ( hf ) profile and other model parameters. we find that the modulation takes nearly 14 months and that the increase of the time takes nearly 7 months. [ cols= " < ", ] in fig. [ fig_sim1a ], the bright edge of the g4s superimposed on the black hole case, shows the intensity of the collisional collisional excitation as a function of time [ @xcite ]. in fact, the amplitude of the acceleration, of the escaping cr, increases with time according to the hf profile. ] as the energy density in the heliosphere decreases, the magnetic field in the innermost region is lower, up to the equatorial region. at this scale, the acceleration of the cr is less efficient than the resistivity, and it causes a slow expansion of the inner region, in spite of a strong resistivity of the sw magnetic field. this mechanism is different from gev propagation, where acceleration occurs at the poles and the effect is much more pronounced. the present model is able to explain the observed modulation of gcs with a suitable combination of magnetic field, gf and a neutral sheet. we demonstrate the model performance by simulating a diffusive propagation of a cr through the solar atmosphere, from the outer limit ( at 1015 au ) to the earth ( at 1 au ), and find good agreement with the solar data.
charge coupled devices ( ccds ) have been successfully used in several high energy physics experiments over the past two decades. their high spatial resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying short - lived particles. the linear collider flavour identification ( lcfi ) collaboration is developing millisecond - scale ccd devices for use in the experimental imaging and readout experiments at high energy densities. the main disadvantage of ccds is their susceptibility to radiation damage. in this paper, we are studying the effect of radiation damage in a prototype ccd, the prototype being a silicon detector with 12@xmath0 pixels. we have performed detailed 2d simulations of the device geometry without approximations for the charge storage volume and transport. the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) is modelled by a differential equation in terms of the different time constants and temperature dependence of the electron capture and emission processes. the time the charge spends under the gates is much longer than the time spent in the gaps ( which is of the order of a nanosecond ), therefore the trapped charge density is higher in comparison with the region between the gates. the electrons are captured from the signal packet and each electron fills a trap. the electron emission process is then described by the emission of captured electrons from one trap to a second. this leads to a total charge under each gate. the mean occupancy ratio of the pixels is found to be in the range between 1 % for a 50mhz readout box and 10 % for readout boxes with a characteristic value of about 2. the peak cti of the model is placed between 145k and 150k, at a predicted operating temperature of about 250k, depending on the readout frequency. our results identify a minimum temperature where the operation optimizes the cti. this may allow predictions of cti for other ccd geometries without requiring a full simulation. 99 c. cohen - tannoudji, _ advanced ccd concepts _ ( wiley - interscience, 2006 ). w. tittel, m. endres, and h. zbinden, ` ` a prototype low - energy electron - positron detector, '' phys. rev. lett. * 100 *, 044,301 ( 2008 ). m. nielsen and i. chuang, _ high - energy physics _ ( university science books, 1986 ). e. knill, r. laflamme, w. c. swann, h. g. lee,
we investigate the behavior of one - component fluids confined by parallel substrates, at a distance @xmath0 from each other, in the presence of the fluctuations of the medium induced by the objects. the fluctuations are the same as the ones that cause the van der waals forces within the critical region of the system. therefore, to a great extend the thermodynamic casimir force is also _ quantum _ electro - dynamical ( qed ) potentials. we show that the interactions in the system, mediated by massless excitations, are long - ranged ( i.e., can decay in a power - law and not in an exponential with the distance way ). thus, it is important to consider the behaviors of the casimir and the net forces when they both are coupled to a common fluid medium. we especially discuss the possible applications of our results for the design of micro- and nano - devices utilizing fluctuation induced effects in colloid physics. fluctuation mediated interactions play a dominant role in the control of the macroscopic properties of colloidal particles. for instance, under proper choice of the core material of the colloid and of the coating the particles will have a stable equilibrium distance to the bounding plate. in the case of a simple fluid these potentials increase the adsorption of the fluid near one of the surfaces, leading to preference there of its liquid phase, and decrease it near the other one. similarly, in a binary fluid mixture we demonstrate that this experimentally realizable competition between the effects due to the coatings and the slabs can result in interesting effects like sign change or noise effects, acting between the surfaces confining the fluid when one changes the fluid s dimensionality ( say, its chemical potential ), the central region of its boundary condition ( say its temperature ), or the total grand canonical potential per unit area. awareness of such possible applications is obtained by understanding the role that the different interactions play on the microscopic level.
a generalization of the abrikosov - gorkov equations of an electrically neutral impure superfluid in an external magnetic field is presented. it is shown how the scattering self - energy part of the order parameter at zero temperature for a pure superfluid depends on the scattering phase and the impurity concentration for various scattering phases. gapless superfluidity is realized in the case of born and unitary @xmath0he in the limit of small impurity concentrations. the importance of the antiferromagnetic order parameter on the transition temperature is discussed. introduction of the matsubara frequency to the self - consistency equation is emphasized. the generalization to arbitrary scattering phases is shown, and explicit expressions for the scattering amplitudes, the order parameters and their dependence on the curie temperature are given. the calculations performed to determine the position of the points of the gapless points indicate that the temperature at which the superfluidity becomes gapless are identical to those actually realized in alloys with paramagnetic impurities. in the absence of magnetic field quantum interference effects are negligible for impurities of even sub - micron size. at finite magnetic field a gap appears between the values of the effective wavefunctionals of quasiparticles above the fermi level in the quantized form. in a recent series of papers @xcite it has been shown that an incommensurate ferromagnetic spin-1/2-wave superconductor under the assumption of a geometrically thin lippmann - schwinger liquid is a model system for the superfluid, which has been realized in a wide range of systems both in bulk and in thin films of carbon nanotubes. the model system is based on the concept of an order parameter consisting of a normal vector space - like hamiltonian and of an asymptotic 2x2 matrix in particle - hole space. the role of the gap in the bec - bcs theory of superconductivity has been extensively studied in the literature, both for bulk systems and for thin films. it was clearly shown in ( [ logttc0 ] ) that for sufficiently small concentrations of paramagnetic atoms the gap vanishes though the scattering amplitude becomes finite in the born limit, and in the unitary limit a gapless region of finite size appears! in the second half of the paper the author has considered an alternative situation where anharmonic order parameters are introduced so as to determine for the first time the relevant physical conditions, that is to say, the scattering
we address the coupling of mixed finite element ( fem ) and boundary element method ( bem ) on lipschitz - continuous interfaces. we treat the exterior boundary value problem between the _ johnson & ndlec _ ( j & n ) _ method and the _ costabel & han _ ( c & h ) method, which are based on the combined effect of a single boundary integral equation on the coupling boundary @xmath0 and the fredholm theory. the latter is proved to be able to yield a symmetric and non - symmetric scheme. however, the well - known dual - mixed approach, which makes use of two bounday integral equations to derive a fixed integral solution for the laplace operator in the case of the homogeneous stokes equation in a bounded exterior region, is not applicable to the coupled process. this failure is due to the neglect of the smoothness of the coupling boundaries, which is contrary to the general belief that smooth boundaries are necessary for a correct description of the stokes equations in the first case and, consequently, to improve the efficiency of the resulting finite element discretizations. we identify the main shortcomings of the latter approach and prove that they can be compensated by requiring the respective discrete spaces to be smooth enough, thus allowing the coupling to be polygonal / polyhedral. this leads to a new proof that the required coerciveness property can be achieved without arguing by contradiction the necessity to impose any smoothness requirement on the interfaces. moreover, by considering finite element spaces instead of mesh - dependent norms, we are able to derive and analyze the coupled variational formulations for the mixed - fem and bem that are stable for different boundary conditions on the interior boundary of the annular domain. these formulations are analyzed with the natural norms of the spaces involved and through direct proofs of the required continuous and discrete coeciveness properties. finally, we examine the galerkin schemes arising from the coupled formulations studied in this direction, and provide explicit hypotheses to be satisfied by these discrete spaces in order to guarantee their corresponding solvability and stability. * cern - th/2002 - 195 + uthep-02 - 036 + msc - numbers : * 11.10.jv, 11.20.lc, 03.70.+k, 11/02/da, 42.50.+p, 43.25.+q
we calculate the dressed one - particle green s function of the kane - mele - hubbard model for a 2d honeycomb lattice in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and e - e repulsion. this is an extension of topological invariants from the non - interacting to the interacting case for the first time and we show that in both cases the eigenstates of the topological hamiltonian display an identical semimetal behaviour. the dependence on the symmetry and size of the cluster s size and the symmetry of the quasiparticle band dispersion is shown to be crucial in order to identify the accuracy and appropriateness of the results. the results are in agreement with previous quantum cluster results, but the violation of translational symmetry in the 6-site tiling is found to be an artifact of the wrong cluster symmetry used in the quantum cluster approach, and an artifact that is corrected by using clusters with wrong symmetry. [ quantum.phys. lett. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) ] the possibility of observing semimetality in a band insulator is a topic that has received a lot of attention recently @xcite. in particular, it has been observed that under certain conditions a topological transition can occur in a range of temperature @xmath0 where the band structure of the material changes from a non - superconducting to a metallic or antiferromagnetic state, with the exact transition points depending on the strength of the correlation between the spins. the associated with such a transition can be regarded as a first order phase transition : with the zero - temperature phase transition the two - dimensional topological field theory ( tti ) can behave as a topologically non - trivial insulator with a band structure that consists of a square lattice of quasi - particles. an adiabatic connection between tti and quantum spin hall insulator ( qsh ) is observed to persist in all regimes, although in the case of qsh the semimetals part of the tti phase diagram may be absent. in the same vein, for the qsh phase diagram, we observe that at the transition points the single particle excitation gap, namely the minimum energy separation between hole and particle excitations, closes down. we propose that this can be understood in terms of the fact that the quasi - particle energy spectrum displays the correct symmetry for the interacting system of interest, and that this gap, which is needed to exactly cancel out the energy gap associated with the exchange interaction at the
cooperation among unrelated individuals is emergent within groups and populations due to a variety of evolutionary effects. one of these evolutionary mechanisms is that of self - rewarding behaviour. in this context, we study cooperation in a truly multiplayer game, where there are only two attractors and two repellers. the number of participants in each match ( @xmath0 ) is the minimal number of cooperators necessary for cooperation to take place. we define the threshold game as the game in which cooperation, at each match, is highest or lowest among the participants. we show that the average behaviour of the players as a function of the cost - to - reward fraction, i.e. the amount of money an individual has available to share with others, is highly dependent on the topology of the population. both on- and off - network topology dependence, as well as higher level effects such as clustering are observed. we also find that structure appears to primarily decrease cooperation, by destabilizing the mixed pseudo - equilibrium in favour of the fully defecting state. at least to the extent that the resulting system can be compared to the mean field or fully mixed models. given the good correspondence between the theoretical predictions and numerical observations in this paper, we suggest that similar evolutionary dynamics can be observed in a more general context and furthermore that clustering and topology can be combined to generate similar dynamics. furthermore, we find that for regular networks with ( at most ) different topology, the payoff from a match is nonlinearly related to the few cooperators that are present in the current game, leading us to suggest a working notion of an effective population size for a given population structure with respect to the transition. this behaviour is similar to the behaviour observed in very small, fully mixed, populations, thus suggesting that game theory can be a suitable paradigm for modelling large - scale social systems. + * keywords : * multi - player dynamics, threshold game, social networks, network structure
the energy relaxation due to magnetic impurities in thin metallic wires is studied theoretically. the experiments are performed at very low temperatures ( below the kondo temperature ) where the electron - phonon scattering is weak, thus the main inelastic processes are electron - electron scattering and the scattering due to magneto - magnetic impurity interaction. the leading logarithmic approximation is used in order to collect the relevant terms in the transport equation. the kernel in transport equation is determined using the method of perturbation theory. the electron distribution and exchange coupling renormalization is carried out in a self - consistent way. the korringa relaxation is taken into account in the kernel and then the renormalized kondo coupling is numerically determined. the transport phenomenon is considered in the case of non - equilibrium situation. that situation arises from those regions where there are sharp changes in the energy distribution functions at the two fermi energies. at the end of the simulations the voltage applied on the short wire plays crucial role which has to be incorporated into that scheme. the applied voltage can be used in two different ways : ( i ) for weak energy relaxation the electron comes from one of the two contacts and its distribution is well described by the leading kernel, thus it does not provide any information on the energy relaxation of the electrons. ( ii ) for strong enough voltage bias the distribution of the electron energies is rather sensitive to the position of the impurity and two further steps are necessary to explain the experimentally observed anomalous energy relaxation rate, _ e.g. _ the magnetic surface anisotropy and the anomalous additional relaxation rate. the results are analyzed from the point of view of the importance of the different ingredients of the theory. _ key words _ : transport equation, self - consistently determined coupling, kondo effect, magnetic field, bias voltage, non - equilibrated transport, konotopulation, universal conductance fluctuation, kaonov - bohm oscillation.
the distribution of charge on a thin, cylindrical conductor has been the subject of much theoretical interest in recent years. the intuition underlying this inquiry is the expectation that a sufficiently thin, smoothly curved filament, when viewed up close, would appear long and straight, so that the equilibrium behavior of charges on the filament should be nearly uniform _ just as in the case of straight conductors _. here we consider the behavior of the electric field components and the electrostatic potential in the limit of vanishing distance from an arbitrary point of the filament, and carry out an asymptotic analysis to calculate the divergent parts of these quantities explicitly. we can conclude that the equipotential surfaces of the physical filament approach those of the ideal one as its diameter vanishes, and use this to deduce the inverse - logarithmic approach of charge distribution to uniformity. the primary result of this paper is that the density of charge along a regular conducting filament of fixed diameter tends to uniformidity according to eq. ( ). an alternative derivation of this result using energy minimization is developed in examples of straight and circular filaments. 1-dimensional electric field, electric potential, filament, geometry, methods : analytical, numerical
the exact surface exchange - correlation energy of a uniformly spin - polarized jellium is an important issue in condensed matter physics. an efficient way to estimate this energy is to use the gradient - corrected density functional, the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ). gga approximate density functionals have been widely used in quantum chemistry. however, a significant fraction of the gga functionals do not recover the exact exchange response below a well - defined threshold. in this work, we compare the response of the lsd and pbe gga approximations to the one obtained from quantum monte carlo calculations. to do this, we first scale to the low - density limit and then find that exchange correlation should be independent of spin for all systems of interest. we calculate the exchange correlation and correlation energy for different densities and metallicities and compare the results to the predictions of local spin density ( lsd ) and the nearly non - empirical zupan blaha ( pkzb ). since lsd has the correct spin dependence, we find that tpss does not alter the pbe correlation energy. we then calculate the linear response for lsd, pbe, and the meta - gga functional. for all three functionals, we obtain very similar results. in particular, gga greatly improves on lsd for the most properties, such as the uniform phase instability, which is a direct consequence of the formation of a charge density wave. furthermore, the response is very sensitive to the choice of the kinetic energy density ( @xmath0 ). when this density dependence is violated, the system undergoes a star - like instability. the instability is very slow compared to the superlastic instability, and it is most likely to occur in very dense regions of the phase diagram. this mode of instability is similar to the star - formation instability found in high - density superconductors. finally, we show that the independence of the p kzb surface energy and that of lsd is a highly significant effect.
we construct the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in dark matter halos at redshifts @xmath0 2 from a simple empirical model that involves the dark matter halo mass function and the relation between central galaxy luminosity and the mass of the halo occupied. we also consider the large - scale bias factor and other statistics related to galaxy clustering. to compare with existing data, we relate the lf of galaxies as a function of redshift to a combination of the mass function slope and the exponential cut - off luminosity, and compare to rest - uv lfs from deep2, combo-17, and 2dfgrs ( croton et al. 2004 ). we find that : ( 1 ) galaxy luminosities must evolve with redshift ; under this assumption, the redshift lf is well described by a mass - dependent evolution, with luminosity densities increasing as luminosity increases ( with the slope decreasing from 0.53.0 m@xmath3 to 1.67.9 mcm^-3 ). ( 2 ) the faint - end number density of galaxies, including red and blue galaxies, must decrease rapidly out to a redshift of 8. this is consistent with measurements in the literature on the rest frame b - band ( 2 - 10 ) lf. ( 3 ) the mass scale of galaxies at redshift @xipp0 2 is distributed between @xcite 10@xigm@xipp3 to 10@xcite 30.4m@xfig3. we expect that one order of magnitude of corrections to the derived lf and galaxy bias must be necessary to explain the existence of such a high - redshift population of red galaxies. indeed, if we assume that the bright - end density of bright galaxies declines as expected, we still find agreement with observations on the whole range in luminosity of interest. on the other hand, when we apply our simple model to 1-dimensional samples of galaxies with masses between 3 and 6, the agreement for the present lf within a factor of 10 is much smaller than the current estimates ; this suggests that either 1 2/3 of the massive halos lie below the current detection limit, or that a different mechanism is needed to explain these high - luminosity galaxies.

we show that crossed products by actions of finite groups preserve the ideal and projection properties. in particular, we show that a pointwise outer action of a finite group on a c*-algebra @xmath0 does not even have the ideal property. this contradicts the commonly accepted result that all crossed products are hereditarily saturated. the rokhlin property @xcite was introduced to characterize the property of actions of abelian groups. it is the property that makes an action of any finite group, such that it separates the ideals in the reduced product, into two distinct parts : the crossed product and the fixed point. in this paper we bring more attention to the notion of crossed products than to the more traditional topic of fixed point algebras ( which are, by definition, nonabelian groups ). the idea is that a crossed product can be ( and has been ) locally approximated by an infinite ( and finite ) unital kirchberg algebra in the sense of definition [ d : sat ]. it turns out that kirching algebra is not so general. we will discuss this problem in more detail in section 3. in the present paper we consider the class of finite group actions which are direct limits of sequences of unital ( separable nuclear ) cataclysmic ( c *-algebra ) algebrahs. each of these actions is a crossing ( in a projection space ) of an ideal in the projection space. a fixed point algebra ( wlb ) algebra, is a wlb algebra that is stable under crossings of the crossed products. it follows from definition [ l - st_1 ] that every uv - answerable wlb algebra is a candidate for a time - field quantum state, and there is a natural expectation that all such an algebra should have a positive topological constant. we note that this is not the case with all finite groups ; see definition [ subsec_2 ] below. ) so far we do not know of any examples of an action at all of a local finite group ( or group satisfying the cosine / anomaly conditions ) on a purely infinite wb algebra ( although this should be the subject of this paper ).
we present simultaneous multiwavelength spectral analysis of the optical and x - ray emission from the blazar 3c 454.3. we get b, v, r and i colour indices on almost all nights during the 2011 through 2014 observing seasons. the bwb trend is prominent on all colour indices, indicating a redder when - brighter behaviour ( rwb ) for this source. several colour indices show significant correlations with the ( b - v ), ( v - r ) and ( r - i ) magnitudes, indicating possible origins of the observed variability. no significant time delays are found, implying a synchrotron dominated emission. the lack of any time delays among the optical bands, and the observed rwb trend, suggest that the radiating electrons are shorter than the light - travel time across the jet, with typical radial dimensions of the order @xmath0 cm. this prediction is likely to be tested with co - ordinated optical / xray monitoring observations of 3c 54.3, 3c 279 and s5 0716 + 714, for which the data are available at the time of writing.

the bps framework is developed in the context of the maxwell - carroll - field - jackiw - higgs ( mcsh ) model in @xmath0 dimensions. it provides first order equations for the scalar potentials and provides a general framework for the analysis of radially symmetric topological vortex solutions. the general behavior of the bps equations is compared with the usual mcsh ones. it is shown that the lorentz - violating parameter plays the role of a chern - simons coupling, and the electromagnetic coupling constant plays an important role in enforcing the symmetrization of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the origin. the magnetic and electric fields share a similar behavior, with the magnetic field saturates at the origin and the electric field around the origin, while the latter is always positive, varying from the strong flux region centered at origin to the ring - like region existing for an intermediary radial coordinate. physically, this corresponds to the behavior typical of mcsh vortices : for large values of the longitudinal component of the current density, the potentials provide a sharpened background whichcouples the neutral and gauge fields. as a result, the magnetic flux is proportional to the quantized magnetic flux and the resulting red shifted area is favored by the gauss - krausz - teichmller theorem. in addition, the proposed bps energy density profiles are always positive and exhibit a certain regularity property. in the light of the theoretical results obtained from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert - schrieffer ( lv ) equation, the generalized mcsh model is often cited as a reference model when studying the behavior of plasmas. in recent years, the literature related to the bec - bps interactions has increased enormously, owing to the increasing technical developments in the field of condensed matter physics. in particular, due to the possibility to incorporate into the theoretical framework of the known mcsh models @xcite, the interplay between electrodynamics and topology has become a hot topic of current interest. in both theoretical and experimental interest. the present work@xcite aims to push the understanding of the general bps model to the next level by extending it to the realm of non - abelian gauge and topological topological fields. specifically, the present paper is aimed at the solution of the standard 3d lv electric field equations or, in the second order approximation, to the case when the plasma is not in equipartition with
we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of 977 galaxies at @xmath0 that span a range of environments, including the low density field, groups, and clusters. we find the median star formation rates ( sfrs ) of galaxies in the field to be higher than their counterparts in the high density field by 0.05 mag. in contrast, the median ssfr of galaxies above a stellar mass limit is lower by a factor of 1.2. using a mass - limited subsample with stellar masses above @xcite, we find a declining sfr or specific sfr ( ssfr - density ) relation between galaxy density and stellar mass. we show that at a given density, the scatter in the ssfr and sfr at fixed stellar mass is a decreasing function of the density, with the former decreasing from the lowest to highest densities and the latter increasing from the highest to lowest densities. the effect is most noticeable for the lowest density galaxies, where the decline in the sfr with increasing density is more significant than that for the highest density galaxies. the scatter persists even when excluding galaxies located in the vicinity of the cluster where extinction is most severe. the lowest mass galaxies in our survey have a median sfr a@xmath1, while the highest mass galaxies have a mean sffr a(t ) of 0.7 dex. we do not find any intermediate density regime in which the median ssfrs of galaxies are elevated relative to their counterparts. the sfra for sfgs in groups and clusters are lower than that of the field for a given their density, while quiescent galaxies continue to dominate in groups. the ldp based, mass - limit - driven, star formation rate ( sfr - sfr ) relation is a similar to the field sfr relation despite also having a lower mean sfr. we present stacking analysis of the star formation fractions of galaxies without _ mips _ detections and find them to be close to the detection limit.
we study the transition from regular to chaotic motion for stars moving in the meridian @xmath0 plane, in a time dependent galactic model with a disk - halo and a spherical nucleus. we explored all the available ranges regarding the values of the main involved parameters of the dynamical system. in particular, we obtained the relationship which connects the critical value of the angular momentum with the mass of the nucleus. it was found that the main parameter determining whether an orbit would change or not and how its orbital nature during the mass transportation, is the final value of one of the central mass - to - luminosity ratios, defined by caranicolas & papadopoulos ( 2003 ). the main outcome of this work is that low angular momentum stars on approaching a dense and massive nucleus are deflected to higher values of angular momentum, due to the strong vertical force near the dense nucleus. the amount of deflection depends on the total amount of mass available to a star in the region, close to the center of the galaxy. near the center, in the case when the mass is transported from the disk to the nucleus, the deflected stars are more easily removed from the center upon interacting with the dark halo component. this strongly suggests that near such massive nuclei the nature of the orbits of the stars must be highly chaotic, i.e., with isotropic velocity dispersions. our numerical experiments show that the total force is entirely due to that of the massive nucleus and behaves like a harmonic oscillator. in order to explain the wide range of outcomes of the numerical experiments, we have to assume that the dark matter halo is the dominant mass at large radii, where stars are expected to move. we use the description of the halo by collinear models and show that, once more than metallicity is taken into account, the problem of the density of stars in the central regions of disk galaxies becomes reduced to the one of stellar diffusion.

the triple higgs self - coupling in the standard model may be accessible to direct measurement at the electron - positron linear collider ( lc ) with centre - of - mass energy at the tev scale. in this study we compare the signal of the most promising channel with its dominant electroweak ( ew ) and qcd backgrounds, as a function of the higgs boson mass. the study of the ew background is of particular interest for the measurements of double higgs - strahlung production ( off a @xmath0 ) with subsequent decays into an off - shell gluon ), where the signal can be unambiguously detected at the lc. the categorization of the electroweak background into different resonant topologies and of the signal itself into different sub - processes demonstrates that the latter is more promising than the former, and thus allows a better determination of the potential of the channel. in particular, we find that the cross section for the lowest higgs mass models is about two orders of magnitude smaller than for the higher masses models, hamiltonian studies have suggested. epsf.tex # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 00 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2000 + * triple and four subsequent deboost * + + + _ submitted to eur. phys. j. c _ + _ f.d. aaron@xmath1, m. aldaya martin, c. alexeev, k. alimujiang, v. andrzejewski, a. antunovic, s. backovic,1 g. baghdasaryan, p. baranov, e. barrelet, w. bartel, u. bassler + _ the enrico fermi institute, the university of ch-1211, ch-8057 chicago, illinois 60637, usa _ + m. bertaina, a.- p. belforte, d. benjamin,9 a. beretvas, j. p. berger + _ joint institute for nuclear research, dubna, russian federation _ + b. e. bozovic - jelisavcic, g. buschhorn, l. bystritskaya, f. baum + _ to be submitted to physics letters b _ + october 2009 +
we present a high - speed source of entangled photons for quantum key distribution using a 15.6 mm long periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath0 waveguide source. our source features nearly - lossless spectral filtering and exhibits a generation efficiency of @xmath1 6 pairs/(s_b_mw ) per pixel at 628.5 mhz, among the highest ever reported for a waveguide entanglement source. we characterize the performance of the source using ingaas single - photon avalanche diodes with square - wave and sinusoidal gating waveforms, and measure the raw franson interference using two entangled photon pairs for entangled pair generation and detection. we measure the highest - order temporal correlation time of 0.8 ns and the lowest - order franson interferences of 98.8 % and 98.2 %, respectively, in the time - domain entangled - pair case. we evaluate the impact of franson interferometry by evaluating the raw counts of bit errors in the fiber interferometer. we observe that an accidental error that is due to an accidental path difference between entangled photons in a fiber - optic system and an eavesdropper s path is excluded for an error - correction coding protocol, leading to a secure key rate of 1 mbit / bit per bit. we further observe that waveguide sources with correlated photon pairs can be used for experimental demonstration of high - spectral - resolution timekeeping, and for secure key generation via time - resolved spectroscopy. 10 a. marcikic, m. n. fejer, j. bradford, w. tittel, and h. zbinden, ` ` quantum cryptography using squeezed photons in optical - waveguides, '' phys. rev. lett. * 69 *, 25942597 ( 1992 ). j. y. aharonov, y. a. athar, r. h. mahmood, h. t. algora, s. saraf, and s. v. krishnamoorthy, _ quantum information with squeezed photons _ ( imperial college press, 2007 ). w. wang, l. zhang, x. j. cao, b. g. dai, jia, n. l. dong, and j. p. wahrsch, _ optical quantum information transfer from squeezed photons to a continuous variable state space _ (quantum society of america b.c. and comp. comm.
the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom and orbital effects in quantum systems is a fundamental but poorly explored problem. here we report on a measurement of the zeeman splitting of ground state spins in a two - dimensional quantum dot. it is found that the diamagnetic shift of levels in the quantum dot is about an order of magnitude smaller than the level shift in the conventional tunneling electron gas. in addition we find that, with sufficient accuracy, spins that move up and down in plunger gate can be identified as spin pairs, i.e. states that are successively occupied by spin - up and spin - down. since such states are the ground state of the dot, they are ideally suited to ground state gates based on e.g. bohr s magneton. extrapolating our results to high electron density states, we demonstrate that gate voltages induce a singlet triplet ground state spin transition. the energy spectrum of this transition can be extracted from raw data and is in good agreement with gaas bulk g - factor estimates. we also find that the exchange matrix elements are required by the spin gap to be positive, but that the magnitude is reduced to low values as more spins are added to the system. the possibility of a non - classical origin of unusual energy spectra and of exotic ground state phases has attracted an increasing interest in recent years. this is due, in particular, to the prospect of using spin coupled quantum dots as information carriers. the non - trivial role played by spins in quantum dots has been extensively studied using neutron scattering experiments @xcite and in particular the investigation of the quantum phase transition from a double quantum dot to a quantum dot with a single electron filled into the valence band. the system, consisting of two spatially separated quantum dots of opposite spin density, is intrinsically one - dimensional and represents a challenging problem. for example it is important to understand the nature of this phase transition because the reversal of the given spin gives rise to so - called spin - flip transitions, where the spins flip from one dot to the other. because of the influence of the electron gas, for a given electron density, this reversal is expected to occur periodically, which can lead to a splitting of the electronic energy levels. however, past experience has taught us that this phenomenon can only be eliminated by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field. considering the present experimental challenges, it is very important to verify experimentally the validity of the above suggested mechanism and to investigate the quantum dynamics behind the phenomenon. in this context,
the evolution of a mars - like planet with a thick co@xmath0 atmosphere and a faint young sun is investigated by means of three - dimensional global climate simulations. the simulations are performed using a standard lmd global climate model originally developed by james pollack and his collaborators with the goal of studying early climates on mars as well as possible climates on extrasolar planets some 3.5 - 3.8 gyr ago. a wide range of dynamical, meteorological and climatic phenomenons are observed in the simulations including the effects of precipitation, solar irradiation, cloud microphysics parameters, obliquity and eccentricity, dust loading, and possible atmospheric dust loading. in this paper, we focus on the regime where mars was mostly dry, and neglect the effect of water vapor. we find that in most simulations the water - covered mars climate is very similar to that on present - day mars. the mean surface temperatures are lower by a factor of 5 - 10 compared to a water - free atmosphere, and the subsurface optical depth is reduced to about 0.2. the thomson temperature is highest ( @xmath1 k ) for the highest pressure layers and lowest cloud sizes, and drops to about 1 k for the lowest pressures. the surface optical depth drops to 0.1 k at pressures above 25 k. in the most unstable regions, up to 40 k above the ancient mars surface, and to zero at higher pressures, before the ancient martian aquaporin flows completely out of the atmosphere. surface temperatures can not be much higher than 30 k. summertime mean surface temperature above 0@xmba ( a condition which could have allowed rivers and lakes to form ) is highest, at all latitudes, but not in locations where most valley networks or layered sedimentary units are observed. thus, while the water vapor aerosols or other greenhouse gases considered thus far in the literature have not been ruled out, they require special circumstances to play a significant role in warming the surface of mars to its present state. the early mars climate that we explore here is different from that explored in previous works based on a model for early climates in the solar system ( wordsworth et al., 2006 ), which assumed that mars was dry and did not contain significant amounts of liquid water. our model shows that a substantial amount of dry water could have melted and risen above the surface in the last 4 gyr. this picture is consistent with the observed geological evidence on mars, although we can not rule out
the possibility of a @xmath0 phase of bulk perovskites due to the jahn - teller lattice distortion is studied. starting from the symmetry analysis of the possible lattice distortions, we identify a fourfold symmetry mode coupling among the four distortions : a q@xmath1 quasiparticle lattice motion of the order of the fundamental plane - parallel to the bulk ordering ( a, b, c, d and e ), an aharmonic coupling of the a and b phonons, a third phonon mode corresponding to a half filled - high spin - orbit ( fp ), and a third one representing a hybrid between a polar and an anti - polar motion. the four phonons are condensate independently in each case, resulting in quite different ground states. we identify the orbital - ordering as being solely responsible for the orbital ordering, and we perform a cleavage analysis to separate all the modes individually. from this analysis we extract the amplitudes of the individual distortions, providing a free energy leading to the development of an electric field. we use this free energy to demonstrate the electric - field control of the orbital distortions, and further reveal that the polar mode developed in the intermediate srtio@xday4 phase ( around 175 % tensile strain ) can be used to create an effective electric field by applying an external electric field along the direction of spontaneous polarization, leading to a polarization - polarization crossover. we further show that by condensing all the phonons independently, the previously reported orbital ordering can be explained from a single hybrid mode. this crucial point allows us to gain insight into the origin of an unusual orbital ordering for materials that are still in their bulk magnetic phase. further, we demonstrate that by computing the phonon modes individually, we can lock in a hybrid unstable / polarized mode, having a mixed character between a and a distortions, that can lead to electric field control over the orbital structure. the structure and dynamics of the polar phase are then compared to those of the corresponding liquid phases. we finally discuss the implications of our results for the formation of a mott insulator phase and for the class of materials that may develop a polar phase under large epitaxial strain.
we show that the mechanism of dimensional oxidation of supergravity solutions can be generalized to non maximally split cases and that it can be used to construct exact solutions for any supergravity model irrespective of the number of preserved supersymmetries. this mechanism relies on the appearance of parallel projections of the root vectors of the non compact lie algebra which is a subalgebra of the original one. indeed the analytic structure of the solution is determined only by the algebraic structure of @xmath0. we thus conclude that the dimensional reduction invariant paint group plays a central role in the solution construction and in the relevant time evolution of the cosmological factors. * the role of the paint group * + * i.m. dremin@xmath1 * 0.5 cm _ _ _ institute of theoretical physics, chinese academy of sciences, + p.o. box 5167, beijing 100190, china _ _ departamento de matemtica aplicada - espirales, universidade federal de alfenas.rod. jos aurlio vilela ( br 267 ) + _ sec. 2, facultade de ciencias nucleares.rua / institut de mathmatiques de paul sabatier, + _ cnrs - universit paris - dauphine, f-75757 paris cedex 13, france + e - mail : _ daillan@math.univ-paul.fr + _ _ key words _ : _ supergravity, extra dimensions, cosmic billiard, pain group. + * pacs number(s ) * : 04.50.ud, 98.80.cq + * keywords * : + + + _ pacs numbers ( 97.10.db ) : 98.85.+b there has been a recent successful generalization of the compensator method for the solution of problems in physics. this was achieved by generalizing the method given by tsirelson @xcite to problems in any number of coordinates and without restrictions on the values of the parameters of the calculation. this leads to the development of a compensator algorithm which has been successfully applied to a large variety of problems including the problem of 3d - gravity coupled to a quaternionic symmetric space. in this paper we are going to detail the details of the construction of _ smooth cosmic billiards _ which rely on the two necessary extensions of the scheme developed by us in @xc
we study the enclosed stellar and total mass content in a sample of 21 gravitationally lensed galaxies extending up to a radial distance of @xmath0 times the einstein radius. the combination of strong gravitational lensing and population synthesis models constrained by the available photometry allows us to study the difference in concentration of the baryon and the total mass distribution. we find that low mass galaxies exhibit a sharply rising stellar - mass fraction within the virial radius of their dark matter halos, followed by a gradually decreasing fraction at larger radii. this correlation can be explained either by a lower star formation efficiency in less massive galaxies or by more concentrated dark matter in lower mass galaxies. about half of the galaxies in our sample are located in groups and about half are in overdense regions. we use a simple two - dimensional lensing model to correct the observed surface brightness distribution for the lens galaxies. we compare the radial dependence of the stellar mass - to - total enclosed mass fraction and the scatter in the values out to 0.0593@xmath1mpc with a set of galaxy formation models that describe the relation of galaxies to dark matter. our models allow us to get a rough estimate of the enclosed total ( lens ) and stellar mass fraction independent of the considered redshift range, i.e. we are able to disentangle the effects of different lens models and the inherent degeneracies of photometric models on the derived mass profiles. on the whole, model - independent and non - degenerate mass estimates are found to be in good agreement with the lens mass estimates. we conclude that lensing studies on galaxy scales below 10 kpc are feasible if the selection criteria for the sample are re - applied. for this purpose we recommend choosing lens galaxies with redshifts similar to those of the milky way and with colors that fall in the same range as the galaxy star formation rates.

the @xmath0 centauri triple ab ( a1 ab ) is a keystone for understanding the properties of magnetically inspired ` ` activity '' on sun - like stars of solar age. the two companions are bright in all high - energy bands, from x - rays to the ultraviolet ; but the difference in the continua above 1500, and especially for the near - uv at the h and k lines, is much larger. therefore, a study of ab, on a semi - annual basis, is important to improve upon the initial study based on the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ). this work considers a set of far - ultraviolet ( 11501700 ) pointings on ab carried out by the _ hubble space telescope ( stis ) _ with the goal of understanding the global plasma dynamics that is imprinted onto the hot - line profiles. the observations were taken as part of a joint _ chandra / hst _ project, beginning 2010 after the repair of stis in the sm4 mission. the first part of the program includes measurements of astrophysical sources ( a recombination nebula and metal - polluted white dwarfs [ wd ] ) for several of the key hot lines. the recent results confirm the recent generally downward trend of the secondary star ( a ) with respect to the upward trajectory of the primary ( b ). the latter was mired in a long - term low state during the 20052010 observations, but recovered rapidly over the last three years. these results suggest that there is not much difference between the tz conditions of ab and b, even despite the larger activity levels of b, and that b is the better solar analog, in terms of tz activity, since its activity is closely tied to the plage component of the solar disk. in contrast to this, the broad / broad flux partition does not seem to depend on activity level, nor do the average densities seem to evolve either, suggesting that the dominant surface sources of the fuv fluxes are relatively unchanged during the cycle.
we show that the classical edwards - anderson model, with ising spins in the nuclei, undergoes a second - order phase transition in the presence of a non - zero magnetic field. we study the corrections to scaling introduced by the non - smooth behaviour of the leading scaling term. we demonstrate that the magnitude of the scaling corrections is as large as the inverse of the lattice size, a result of the pernicious correction to the second - moment correlation length. finally, we show that this phenomenon is also at play in a recent numerical study of goldstone bosons. the classical @xmath0-spin model is a paradigmatic model of strongly correlated electronic systems. it has been extensively studied in the context of quantum many - body physics @xcite, where it plays an important rle to understand the rather unusual properties of colloidal systems. in the absence of a magnetic field, the system behaves according to a renormalisation - group invariant that has a power - law tail towards zero temperature ( according to the definition of scale invariance by relaxing the coupling to the electron ). the aim of this work is to study a manifestation of this behaviour in the parameter space of the model. specifically, we are interested in determining whether the critical exponents are scale invariant ( i.e., invariant to changes in the parameters of the system ), or exhibit deviations from it. because of the interplay between these two properties for the system as a whole, and the effects of the magnetic field on the microscopic behaviour, it is very important to gain a better understanding of these issues. in recent years, there has been great progress in understanding the underlying physics behind these spectacular effects. at the same time, however, new challenges appear, such as the existence of a finite - size lattice regime in which the critical behavior is completely absent. this would lead to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the conventional definition of phase transition, especially when it comes to describing the behaviour of systems in the vicinity of one of these critical points.
we present results from a multiwavelength study of the blazar pks 0537@xmath0441, including _ fermi _, _ swift _, atom, rem and sma data. strong variability has been observed in @xmath2 rays, with two major flaring episodes in 2009 july and 2010 march, and a harder - when - brighter spectral behaviour, quite common for fsrqs and lsp bl lacs, in 2010 march. the average lat spectrum accumulated over 20 months shows a significant curvature, well described both by a bpl model with @xcmath3 = 2290 mev and a log - parabola model. a quite steep pds slope ( @xfig4 = 1.5 @xik5 0.2 ) has been estimated, in agreement with those observed for the brightest fsrq 3c 454.3. only moderate variability between flux and photon index has been obtained from the deep x - ray observations of october 2008. a significant correlation has been found between the optical flux and the gamma - ray flux, with no correlation with the radio flux or the _ einstein _ index. we present the first comprehensive analysis of the multi - band light curves of this source. the flux at mm wavelengths is found to be correlated with the [ ] band flux, while the flux in the x - rays is about a factor of three smaller. in the optical, the spectrum is well described by a two - component model, with a high - energy electron component and a low - energy ssc component. a consistent analysis has been performed for the synchrotron and compton - scattered emission, respectively. assuming a break in the electron distribution, the present data indicate the presence of compton scattering of ssc photons, probably from the central engine. the increased activity in 2010 seems to indicate a co - spatial emission region, beyond the broad line region, and an emission dominated by ssc emission. we discuss these results in the context of different blazar activity states observed at other wavelengths.

we have used the eso low - resolution spectropolarimeter fors1 to search for magnetic fields in a sample of 50 magnetically active asymptotic giant branch ( haebe ) stars. twelve stars were detected in both balmer and metal lines, while four were only marginally detected in their emission lines. we conclude that for most of the sample stars, _ bona fide _ magnetic fields are likely to be present. in hd 144432, hd 31468 and hd 144668, we detect a strong longitudinal magnetic field, with a mean field intensity of @xmath0 g. in the case of bf ori, we tentatively detect a field, of order 150 g, inferred from the balmer lines. the detection significance distribution of magnetic field strength in these stars is statistically identical, and is consistent with a uniform population of non - magnetic stars. this result indicates that our sample does not contain a significantly larger number of stars with strong fields than the main sequence stars. to interpret the general results of this survey, we explore the influence of magnetic fields on the late stages of the formation of intermediate - mass stars. we use monte carlo simulations to calculate lower limits on the surface dipole surface intensities of our sample stars. taking into account the mean intensity of the dipole as a function of stellar rotation axis and inclined angle to the line - of - sight, we estimate that the magnetic fields may be around 1 kg and 3 kg for main sequence rotators, respectively. however, our results are not consistent with ordered magnetic fields frequently producing longitudinal fields stronger than 150 g. we also tentatively conclude that cpd-53 295 may host a magnetic field which is present in the observations, but we can not strictly rule out the presence of a field of this strength in this star. finally, we use the observations of hd 101412 to place constraints on the magnetic field strengths required to account for the late accretion episode. we estimate the field required to produce the observed late - time magnetism in hae be stars to be in the range of 3 to 6 kg.

we study the quantum dynamics of the bianchi ix model within the context of supergravity theories. this is done by generalizing the formalism we used in [ phys. rev. e * 81 *, 051103 ( 2009 ) ] to describe the degrees of freedom of the gravitino by means of a dirac - like gamma - matrix representation. in second - order form, the lagrangian density @xmath0 of the original ` ` simple '' four - dimensional supergravity theory is gauge - fixed by the six local lorentz rotations, and fails to describe any of the six possible time - dependent libration terms in the original theory. hence, the usual kac moody algebras are not applicable ( at least for the three - sphere limit ). furthermore, we find that there are terms quartic in the fermions that allow supergravity to exist, _ i.e. _ there is an extra contribution to the gravitational part of the equations of motion for the vectors. these terms are used to determine the structure of hidden hyperbolic moody structures that have been conjectured in the supergravity / belinskii - khalatnikov / lifshitz ( bkl ) complex near a spatial singularity. similarly, the bkl class of a spatial ( but not spatial ) singularity leads to a chaotic billiard motion within the weyl chamber of the rank-3 kacood - algebra. the dynamics of such billiard states has been the subject of previous studies. on the other hand, a similar behavior has been found in the cosmological context for the associated bkl - like moody algebra. thus, we hope to make progress in the study of this class of models by first extending our analysis to the spatially homogeneous sector of maximal supergravity, before moving on to the realm of ( spatially ) homogeneous field theories.
the general properties of x - ray point sources detected in the chandra observation of the intermediate luminosity elliptical galaxy ngc 3379 are discussed. point sources are resolved into 74 sources, which are coincident with 50 % of the emission within the central 5 kpc. the luminosity function of the point sources is best fit by a single power - law, with a slope of @xmath0, similar to results for s0 galaxies and other ellipticals observed by chandra. spectral analysis of the diffuse emission indicates that it is comprised of either thermal emission from the accretion disk or gas expelled by the central agn. assuming a uniform amount of cooling with the gas mass in theumbra, the total mass of the gas in the ulx could be no larger than 10@xmath1 ergs. the presence of a micro - quasar - like feature in the light curve indicates that the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is dynamically relaxed, while there are indications of recent star formation events in the central parts of the galaxy. the agn spectrum is consistent with that of a mcd emission line, indicating stellar masses of the accreting objects. the mass - radius relation for a he core burning star or a white dwarf predicts a much larger mass for the secondary which is in an early - type galaxy. currently there is no evidence for any pre - existing super - eddington accretion rate system in ngc3379. the observed de - brightening of the central 50 kpc corresponds to a cooling time of approximately 5 times the sound crossing time. the radio luminosity, optical depth and hardness ratios of the off - nuclear sources are all consistent with the expectations for a black hole population with dynamically established kinematics. the central object is not thermalized, suggesting that it could be a stellar mass black hole, although such objects have been observed in a few isolated cases in theocal4 and leo i groups. the x - rays are well - described by thermal bremsstrahlung within the framework of the mekal model, with the effective temperature being same as the interstellar medium in these objects.
we prove that, for spherically symmetric asymptotically flat initial data, the maximal developments of anti - trapped surfaces are non - evolutionary. the study of such systems is a blooming field of study. in particular, there is a great interest in understanding how the non - trivial behavior of solutions to the p.d.s. equations holds when the structure of the initial data is modified by the action of the group. we address a basic question : given a two - dimensional submanifold @xmath0 of non - empty einstein - matter, what are the appropriate ` ` appropriate '' initial data sources for the maximal development of the problem? this question is intimately related to birkhoff s theory of the bernoulli numbers @xcite. we answer this question in the affirmative. we formulate the following three statements. 1. we are motivated by the proposition that the energy of a future point emanating from an ingoing null ray can only be characterized by a finite number of singularities. 2. we include a discussion of the realm of applicability of our first statement, and of any subtleties that might arise immediately after its formulation. 3. we assume that the future point is a connected tangent vector, and we treat the following as an a priori bound : assuming the matter is of compact support, we have another bound : the matter has a finite energy such that the cosmological constant vanishes in the future. this is done in a similar way to how einstein s theory works for massless self - gravitating systems. 4. we prove the following for the case of defocusing a laser beam, in the limit where it is on the defocusing side of a point in the sky. the field of this is a subset of the domain of outer communications, i.e., the domain where the standard curvature is to be embedded. it is modeled on the so - called _ domain of annihilation _, which is an aspect of the standard theory of electrovacuum. 5. we compare the above results with numerical simulations. 6. we estimate the initial value problem, and show that it is upper - bounded with respect to the _ initial _ value problem. this shows that the theory holds, both for matter with compact support and for matter whose behavior is sufficiently tame.
the multiplicity distribution of all charged particles, as well as that of like - sign particles, is studied in the context of a model for @xmath0 annihilation using high statistics data collected with the opal detector at lep. in one - dimensional phase space, in rapidity, azimuthal angle and ( the logarithm of ) transverse momentum, high - order bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) are used to measure genuine correlations between two or more hadrons produced in the same reaction. the two - particle and all - charge cumulants, which are known to be sensitive to the microscopic details of the hadronization dynamics, are measured up to fourth order in two dimensions. in three dimensions, the data are compared to a model computed using normalized factorial cumulant moments, i.e., with several algorithms available in the literature. in the model described, the number of hadrons in each multiplet is allowed to vary continuously, thereby allowing for the study of the stochastic interdependence among groups of different particles. the data allow the experimentally meaningful comparison with predictions, based on models computed with several popular algorithms that are currently available. it is found that the data support the presence of short - range be - type correlations in the multiplets, which have previously been assumed to be insensitive to particle charge. in contrast, correlations in multiplets composed of particles of different charges show a strong dependence on particle rapidity ( and thus the same order of magnitude ). in addition, the domain - size dependence of the higher - order moments, measured in the current data, is found to be much stronger than that observed in earlier opal observations. as a check of the consistency of our results, we compare them with predictions from a model to reproduce the observed oscillatory behaviour of the multiplicity. the model indicates that some model uncertainties may be the result of model discrepancies, in particular due to incomplete treatment of be interference effects.
we perform n - body simulations of satellite galaxy evolution and its induced tidal tail morphology. the objective of this study is to understand the physical processes responsible for satellite galaxy disruption rather than reproducing the evolutionary history of any individual milky way satellite galaxy. we generate three different size satellites, i.e. the massive satellite, the low - mass satellite, and the tiny mass satellite. we demonstrate that the satellite decelerates ( accelerates ) the leading tail beyond the satellite s tidal radius, which is proportional to the satellite mass. for the massive satellites, the spatial correlation between the tail s energy and angular momentum is broken by the interaction of the host halo s gravitational field and the self - gravity of the satellite itself. this leads to the formation of several apparently disassociated phase - space clumps before disruption. since the satellite torques the tidal tail, the distribution of the tidal tails in the observational plane is rather different from predictions that exclude such satellite torquing. in addition, the simulations provide six - dimensional information of the potential of the galaxy s gravitational force, which can be used to compare with upcoming astrometric measurements. we find that the dynamics of satellite tidal tails depends sensitively on satellite mass and orbit. for satellite sizes of @xmath0, the leading and trailing tail do not coincide at all distances from the centre and they have different velocity distribution in the radial velocity distribution. for larger satellites, in agreement with recent observational campaigns, the tail star counts and radial velocity distributions are consistent with simple hill - jacobi theory ( generalised to a wider range of sizes and densities ) and do not show any significant trends with satellite properties. on the other hand, for intermediate mass satellites, a detailed analysis of the tail morphology can not be avoided and we have to assume the satellite has a complex halo structure. as a result, the interpretation of the tidally generated tidal tails and their observational implications are not straightforward.

the extremely large telescope ( vlt ) is a focal plane array of @xmath0 telescopes which has been instrumental in the growth of our knowledge of the universe. we describe the instrument vsi which will provide interferometric imaging at 1 milli - arcsecond spatial resolution for an unprecedented number of targets. vsi will be able to provide spectrally and spatially - resolved ` ` image cubes '' for large classes of previously inaccessible targets. it will also allow imaging of targets which no bright reference is sufficiently close by. the instrument features 3 cryogenic vessels. the control system includes several servo - loop controls and management of the observing software. the science software manages both data processing and image reconstruction. we discuss the instrument, its hardware, and possible future developments. in the near future the vlti could be extended with an additional 6 to 8 telescopes to make use of the capability of vsi. this would provide an unprecedented ability to serve a broad user community within eso and at the same time provide the opportunity for breakthroughs in many areas at the forefront of astrophysics. the vsi instrument comprises single mode fibers, an integrated optics chip, and 4 spectral resolutions through a cooled spectrograph. it also features an internal fringe tracker and an optimization system which allows for servo optical path length differences and optimize the fiber injection of the input beams to the required level. address = max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik, giessenbachstrasse 1, 85741 garching, germany address = european - very large telescope, piazzale della repubblica 10, 35122 pescara, italy, altaddress = laboratoire leprince - ringuet, ecole polytechnique, cnrs, 46 rue fr haulaitis, 75231 paris, france address = enaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via emilio bianchi 46, 23807 merate ( lc ) italy address = dept. of astronomy & astrophysics, pennsylvania state university, university park, pa 16802, usa address = dipartimento di fisica, universit di baltimo, via saragat 1, 44122 baltimore, uk address = department of astronomy and steward observatory, university of minnesota, 115 church st. se, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa
we describe the origin of butcher series and their crucial role in the development of numerical methods. they are named in honour of the new zealand mathematician john butcher. butcher series were introduced in a series of ten sole - authored papers in the years 19631972. a runge kutta method is a numerical approximation of the exact flow of defined by graham and kroupa in each of its underlying vector spaces. we prove that a numerical method has a butcher series if and only if it preserves affine - relatedness, which means that the method preserves invariant affine subspaces, automatically. all these properties are desirable when designing general - purpose ordinary differential equation software. so, to summarize, butcher series are objects intrinsically associated to the set of vector fields on vector ( properly, affine ) spaces of _ all _ dimensions. their ubiquity, then, naturally explains their interest in numerical analysis and simplification. our title question, _ what are butcher series, really? _, is a question about the algebraic and geometric structure of rooted trees and elementary differentials. robin merson s work on rooted trees was inspired by the project of desmond king - hele. he designed a tapestry of orbits for the first time in 1957 that allowed them to estimate the density of the upper atmosphere and ( after sputnik 2 ) the shape of the earth. this development, perhaps regarded initially as a bookkeeping device for finding and keeping track of the different terms, has over time become central to the combinatorial and algebraic study of b - series. merson _ and the butcher series _ have a complicated history. born in brookhaven in 1933, he came to australia and married in 1945. in the 1950 s, he married melanie van der jeugt. and in 1980 he was married. together in the united states of america. their children are now married and have two daughters, melanie and terienne. the old couple have a son, jerry, who is a geophysicist, and phd student in george s college, brussels. jerry and melanie moved to california in 1983 to pursue a more distinguished career in nuclear physics. their marriage was confirmed by the marriage privilege of having your affairs approved by the royal society of belfast, belfast and china. later, in 1983, the marriage was dissolved by the unions of the union, in what is now known as the greatestord british colony. the
the lanczos bidiagonalization ( lsqr ) method and the truncated svd ( tsvd ) method have been seen to have very similar regularizing effects on the discrete ill - posed problem @xmath0 and it is therefore desirable to investigate and identify their full and partial regularizations. in this paper, we concentrate on the lazzeropoulos sqypson ( lsmr ) and tsvd method and make a rigorous and extensive analysis on their regularizations for severely, moderately and mildly ill problems. in particular, we identify the full regularization of l sqr for all three kinds of problems. first, we point out an intrinsic intrinsic fact that the best rank lanczo bidiangularization near best rank approximation to the 2-norm is not unique, let alone its near best value. we prove that, for each such rank, its smallest nonzero singular value may be smaller than its smallest single - value ( with respect to the norm ) in natural order. we then derive some follow - up results that play a central role in analyzing the regularization. we consider general best and near best ranks and we investigate the behavior of the singles - and - doubles ( ritz ) functions for different choices of the norm. we obtain strong constraints on the decay rates of singles and doubles ritz functions, and we show that they decay sufficiently fast to be of practical practical importance to be reliably realizable in practice. in the meantime, exploiting some results on the degree of numericity of lsmrs and cgls, we also identify the ( full ) and ( partial ) regularization in the linear isotropic ( lazzr ) type method, which can be seen as a heuristic explanation on good numerical results. these results suggest that, at least for a large class of ill problems, the langevinck - eldn ( cg ) and langlo - schoenfliordan ( cgl ) methods have an excellent regularization, and it should be particularly useful to identify the cg type methods to that problem. how well or accurately does a cg mode ( e.g., cgme ) attempt to approximate or capture the dominant right singular subspace of a problem of interest for a different kind of ill problem? we then turn to the physically interesting and important question of : _ do the lsqrs of langrodynamics and spanish numerical methods have the full or partial regularization? _ we answer this question in the affirmative by showing that
we present a study of the star formation activity and the gas distribution in ic 2574 using deep 21 cm ( hi ) imaging from the vla. the observations reveal a wealth of stellar features, including a ` ` finger '', a knotty tidal stream, the northeast complex of hii regions, and an extended tail of star formation in the south - west. from the analysis of the pixel - by - pixel color maps in the hi supergiant shell and in the control apertures, we are able to construct a mass surface density map of stellar age and massosity from the comparison of the observed colors with simple stellar population models synthesized with starburst99 models. our best - fitting model indicates the occurrence of two major bursts, one about 100 myr ago and the other during the last 10 myr. the older burst appears to be spatially confined within the inner 4 kpc ( in galactocentric radius ), while the younger burst occupies the wider region of the north - east. we compare the stellar ages and the mass surface densities of the recently formed populations with the hi column density all across this galaxy, and do not find any significant correlation with the star forming activity nor with the available hi gas. the lack of any correlation between star formation and hi is in contrast with the expectation of a relationship between hi and star formation based on both formation of and feedback from young stars. we argue that the star - formation activity ( i.e. the efficient creation of hi holes via ionization of hi via stellar radiation ) is unlikely to be regulated by the hi gas reservoir, nor is it likely to be actively expeling or ionizing a significant fraction of the interstellar medium. we discuss two possible mechanisms to explain the formation of the hi holes : ( 1 ) the stellar winds driving the holes themselves have a kinetic energy that is larger than the kinetic energy of the in - situ supernova explosions ; ( 2 ) the holes are formed during the dynamical age of the young stellar population, and the stellar feedback is not efficient in driving them. on a global scale, we find that the global star formation rate ( sfr ) is a factor @xmath0 lower than the hi sfr.
the gluon dyson schwinger equation in landau - gauge qcd is solved numerically. taking care of various violations of gauge invariance in the approximation, it is found that the renormalized equation for the coupled system of ghosts and gluons in the landau gauge, originally proposed by mandelstam, can be cast in a non perturbative, renormalization group invariant form. we derive the infrared behavior of the strong coupling constant from the solution obtained by solving the original equation semi - analytically. the running coupling is shown to be singular in the infrared, i.e., the product of the coupling and self energy does not acquire multiplicative renormalisation. this allows to relate the coefficient of the @xmath0 function to the string tension and related terms in the interaction to the infrared fixed point. furthermore, we prove the identity of the identity coefficient and derive an infrared singularity corresponding to a linearly rising potential. 1.5 cm * residuals : * the gw - dyson - winger equation + * i.m. dremin@xmath1 * + * m.v. pauchy haldad [ cols= " < ", ] ( submitted to physics letters b ) + * z. phys. b * * nous considrons une relation entre la dynamique irrgularire et la littrale de qcd. bien que la dmonstration repose sur le bien pos, nous tudions les fon sous - suite des grands nombres avec la dpendence des parties. le deuxime auteur a t realise rcequation paramtran un revtement diffrentieusent pour les grands paramtres. en tendant un en le pas, trouv par avec ceux existe un vecteur de tous les ressorts. lobjet de thorie extrmale des systmes factorisations du fondament dans lunification, fut peut tre perturbation sph. dans le cas cristallin, on associe au cnrs, la reprsentation du fond suprieure de la physique thorique et de chimie des phnomnes. cette article is accepted for publication in journal of theoretical physics * b * # 1 * ( # 2 ) # 3. # 1#2#3nucl. phys.
we investigate the detailed enrichment histories of individual elements imprinted on the surface abundances of galactic halo stars using a large sample of stars of nearly 9,000 stars, collected by the saga database. we focus on the metallicity dependence and spatial variation of the mean enhancements relative to iron. for nine elements with the sufficient data, carbon, @xmath0-elements ( mg, si, ca, and ti ), the odd - atomic number element ( sc ), and the iron - peak elements ( co, ni, and zn ), we identify the different evolutionary stages of these elements. considering possible non - linear nature of enrichments, we apply the to inspect the difference in the mean abundance ratios to iron for different metallicities. we find a steep variation, or breaks, in the relationship between the mean enhancement at lower and higher metallicities, as observed in the star formation rates, sfr, and initial mass function ( imf ). across the most metal - rich, all the elements except co and sc exhibit downturns in the enrichment history. for the relatively metal - poor ( emp ) stars, the imf and the spatial distribution of low - mass stars are well - correlated. we identify two different stellar populations, iia and iib, which trace different modes of star formation. iia is characterized by a high - mass imf(s ), which is driven by the gas - rich supernovae ( sne ), while iib is more likely to be formed in mini - halos and survives to present - day. we discuss the origins of these two populations. regarding their chemical enrichment processes. in the emp phase, core - collapsed sne first enriched the interstellar medium with most of metals and iron in halos of relatively small masses, after birth in their host halos. in this case, type ia sne would have propagated from dwarf spheroidal galaxies into more massive halos through the subsequent merging event with larger mass - losing progenitors. conversely, for the iib phase, the would - be object would have been formed in the dense cold dark matter halo of a massive star, or in the thin disk of a primordial galaxy. our study demonstrates the existence of two distinct star formation modes in the early universe, distinguished by the amount of enrichment carried by each one. we suggest the following scenario that each mode is related to its environment : ( 1 ) core - collapse sne enrich the ism with metals through accretion and
the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) has already accumulated a rich collection of early afterglow lightcurves of nearly one half of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ). from the current sample of xrt bursts, we find that the early rapid - to shallow decay transition of the light curves can be well described by a combination of a single power law, with the break coming from a steep decay following the prompt emission, as well as from a gradual ` ` break '' at the end of the last pulse of the burst. we show that the former is usually accompanied by a well - defined temporal steepening break, while the latter is caused by a gradual rebrightening due to the internal dissipation of energy in the fireball. assuming that the curve reflects the curve of the curvature effect observed in grbs, we search for an appropriate @xmath0 for the beginning of the next prompt decay phase ( the ` ` follow - up '' phase ), which allows us to search for a relation between the steep decay slope and the flux at the peak ( ` ` reverse shock '' ), as implied by the very high apparent grb radiation efficiency. we tentatively conclude that the x - raysquake at the start of the decay phase can be interpreted as reprocessed ` ` internal '' emission from the grb prompt emission site. we also discuss the case of a continuously refreshed forward shock, with three possible mechanisms discussed : ( a ) the emission from a ) freely propagating out of the fireball, ( b ) a marginally rebrightened region of the shock front, and ( c ) the reverse shock emission from within the forward shock ( as opposed to the usual internal shock scenario ). epsf.sty epsfig.

we set up a formalism to analyze the phenomenon of synchronization in a lattice of coupled sine circle maps. we identify the independent variables, the differences and the sums of variable values at neighbouring sites, and show that, for the synchronized solution, all the features as seen in the single circle map are lifted to this extra dimension, for an arbitrary spatial period @xmath0. the temporal fixed point case for the synchronised solution, i.e. the spatial period one and temporal period two solution can be solved explicitly to obtain the corresponding width of the stability interval. we also demonstrate that this analysis can easily be extended via the following linear stability analysis. for a specific case, namely the single shift map, we find that as long as the difference of nearest neighbour sites is zero, we obtain synchronised solutions, irrespective of the corresponding temporal period. in this case, we also show that the stability matrix retaining its block diagonal form can be easily extended to higher spatial periods. the formalism set up here may also be used to identify and model any kind of synchronised temporal behavior. for example, as an example, the arnold tongues, and the complete devil s staircase, may be interpreted as synchronised periodic orbits in the case of coupled shift maps. recent studies on synchronization in dynamical systems have shown that it is possible to achieve highly stable behaviour even at the lowest level of the system, if the system is coupled to its nearest neighbours via normal symmetric coupling and periodic boundary conditions @xcite. it is therefore of crucial importance to establish the precise nature of these phenomena, and to understand the role that they may play in the design of the systems observed in the systems under consideration. in recent years, there has been great interest in the synchronization of spatially and temporally stable states, both within and between systems. a synchronised state is defined by a set of equations in the phase space, which are invariant under local perturbations. most of the work has been done for single circle maps, and dynamics of their two dimensional ( 2d ) unitary dynamics have been addressed in the context of monte carlo simulation systems. recently, it has been proposed that synchronization may be observed in more complex systems, such as 2d non commutative lattices of edge - coupled 1d chains, with 1d closed chains of lattice sites. in these systems, if two nodes are coupled by a third non - linear term in their parameter space, then their synchronisation is no longer a simple consequence of the
we consider the experimentally relevant phenomenon of diffraction limited phase space propagation of a single photon through a gas of ultracold atoms. in the thomas - fermi limit, when only interactions are taken into account, the diffraction coefficient is proportional to the atomic number and appears as a narrow, sharply peaked on - site wannier function. this is due to the fact that interactions are usually negligible for most atoms. on the other hand, when interactions are included, the in - trap particle distribution usually splits into a condensed and non - condensed component with a significantly broader momentum distribution than in the ideal gas case. in particular, in the case of a finite interaction energy, the post - expansion momentum distribution for the condensate has a sharp peak at the first lateral peak of the interference pattern, _ i.e. _ when the interaction energy is released as kinetic expansion energy. we describe the theoretical mechanisms for this phenomenon analytically, and we show that the observed visibility depends on the parameterization of the thermal cloud density, _ e.g. _ the number of condensed atoms per site. we also give a simple semiclassical description of the inhomogeneous thermal cloud, for which interaction effects are usually usually neglected to a first approximation. ultrafast cooling and trapping techniques allow for the controlled creation of ultra - cold atomic clouds with properties similar to those of high - temperature superconductors @xcite. the understanding of these systems is further aided by the advent of new experimental techniques, such as by using high - intensity laser pulses which are sensitive to very small fluctuations of the laser wavelength. in these studies, one is usually led to the conclusion that even a tiny concentration of atoms is sufficient to condense a whole brillouin zone. just before releasing the cloud from the trap, the first moments of its expansion are characterized by a high - frequency noise, which is, typically, accompanied by a noise frequency that is a factor @xmath0 larger than the cavity frequency. hence, this kind of measurement is very useful only for moderately bright atoms ( the so - called ` ` first - excited bloch band '' ). to improve the statistics of such measurements, it is common to use the same experimental technique to measure the intensity of the incident laser pulses themselves at different times of its investigation. in this letter, we will derive the conditions for the experiment to be able to discriminate the two different cloud components and to identify the parameters that drive the different density distributions. the calculations presented in this paper are based on a
we report the stimulated optical excitation of high finesse whispering gallery mechanical resonances via stimulated brillouin amplification in a microsphere using a tunable parametric oscillator. the mechanical resonator is implemented as a two - dimensional fabry - perot cavity with stokes optical resonances that are separated by one acoustical wavelength from the interface with the environment. by measuring the fine structure of the beat - spectrum, we verify the presence of a narrow and strong lorentzian that originates from the optical resonance width. further, we show that four - wave mixing of the mechanical beat does not interfere with the experimental measurements and is therefore useful for optical - spectroscopic applications. mechanical oscillation is a fundamental process in physics where one interacts with electromagnetic fields in a non - linear fashion. this process has several important applications such as ultrafast optical and microwave cooling @xcite, optical pumping and cycling of mechanical resonators for cavity optomechanics @xcites, and optoelectric devices for high - finesse optical spectroscopy and frequency estimation @xcitethat, in general, these processes share a lot in common and are often related to each other. a vibrational resonance is a specific example of an optical cavity mode that has a broad range of acoustic and mechanical properties. such resonant optical modes are essential to the operation of many solid - state devices that utilize mechanical elements such as superconducting transistors and light harvesters. in this regard, analogies are provided by whispering - gallery modes that propagate azimuthally just like the optical modes that excite them. however, while these optical modes excite vibrational modes in resonators, their direct connection to the optical properties of the material they are generated by is not understood. as such, the frequency of these mechanical modes is not directly measurable, thus these vibrations are not available for practical applications. here, we present a novel approach to optical stimulated oscillation that relies on a single dimensionless parameter, the taper - sphere distance, to drive the mechanical mode that is stimulated by a broadband optical spectrum analyzer in silica as depicted in fig. [ fig : setup](a ). by slowly varying the amplitude of the pump and the optical fidelity of the optical stokes mode, we observe that the mechanical finesse is indeed stimulated and that this optical frequency, @xmath0100 mhz, is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the optical finesse. this stimulated optical frequency modulation is tunable with a continuous - in
we present a cosmological sph simulation of galaxy formation in a @xmath0 cold dark matter universe. we follow the accumulation of mass and the evolution of the stellar mass function of galaxies in the simulation, using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm gadget-2. the simulation includes one gas rich cluster size halos with masses of 10@xmath1, and the rest of the galaxies have a baryonic mass distribution consistent with the observations. we find that the simulation overproduce galaxies at all masses, and that the removal of baryons that were accreted through hot mode accretion dramatically lowers their masses. in particular, the mass - weighted temperature threshold for star formation reduces by 10 - 20 % the value of previous estimates, even when the simulation included only weak feedback. this effect is extremely evident when we compare the simulated galaxies with the observed cosmic hydrogen mass function, which remains nearly unchanged in the simulations. this result suggests that either agn radio mode feedback, enhanced star formation, or a combination of starburst winds and/or quasar ` ` radio mode '' feedback are important to explain the buildup of the red sequence in massive halos, although none of these mechanisms completely shuts down star formation at late times. we suggest that the most efficient ejective mechanism that can convert rapidly cooling gas into stars is ` ` preventive '' feedback, by which the supernova energy released during star formation balances cold cloud formation and evaporation by the hot medium. this form of preventive feedback is especially important at low redshifts, where the low gas fractions of galaxies with small gas fractions make merger driven central gas flows less efficient. in addition, ` ` extreme '' ejective feedback from massive agn is probably required to completely suppress the accretion of gas below a threshold mass, i.e., below the mass at which x - ray emitting hot gas is completely suppressed. we discuss where in this scenario the observed star formation rates and stellar mass functions are reproduced by the feedback mechanism, and we draw inferences about where in redshift and galaxy / halo mass gas accretion must be suppressed to bring the simulation into agreement with observations.

the implications of the recent ultra deep vlt / vimos u - band observations in the goods - s field ( nonino et al. 2009 ) allow to investigate the escape of lyman continuum photons ( lyc ) from high - redshift galaxies. since not evident contaminations have been reported at redshift @xmath0 1, it is important to study the risk of foreground contamination of lyc emission in these systems. this is addressed by computing monte - carlo simulations from which it is concluded that the median contribution of foreground sources to the residual flux measure below the lyman limit is estimated. it turns out that, contrary to the results of numerical simulations ( e.g., inoue 2009 ), the contribution of galaxies with extremely high escape fractions ( even larger than unity ) to the lyc escape fraction is expected to be minimal. conversely, in the case of lower escape fractions, where galaxies turn out to be inefficient in releasing ionising radiation into the intergalactic medium, they may play a dominant role in the redshift regime. if this is the case, then it may be expected that, as redshift increases, the fraction of galaxies contaminated by foreground blue compact sources increases dramatically. on the other hand, the evolution of the escape fraction appears to be reasonably well explained by a shift of the spatial distribution of galaxies to lower redshifts as the limiting magnitude of the detected galaxies increases. it is argued that a simple seeing shift can not be ascribed to foreground contamination and therefore the whole scenario is more speculative. however, if the blue compact source is not a contaminant, it would appear as an ultradeep, high resolution ` ` morphologically detected '' source down to u@xmath1 30., in particular attention is paid to the possibility that it could be a false detection, since a single blue galaxy would hardly be contaminant in such a case. _ subject headings : _ ultraviolet : galaxies galaxies : evolution galaxies : formation ultraviolet : stars # 1#1
we present a generalization of the perron frobenius ( pf ) theorem for pair of nonsquare matrices, whose vertex set is the set on @xmath0 constraints ( one per entity ) and whose edges represent direct influence between the constraints. we provide a suitable definition of the theorem based on the property that every maximal square ( legal ) subsystem is irreducible. as a motivating example, let us consider the _ power control problem _, one of the most fundamental problems in wireless networks. we first establish that there exists an optimal solution in which only one supporter per entity is required to work. we prove that this solution is in fact the optimal solution of an embedded square pf system. next, we show that the theorem still holds even when the matrices are not square, as it would be if they were, and we define the corresponding _ constraint graph _, which captures the role of the best square representation of the system. from this point of view, the main problem is then to find the optimal power assignment for the transmitters ( as high as possible ), in order to ease the decoding process. we derive a generalized pf theorem for this constrained system and prove that it still holds when the _ maximal eigenpair _ of the matrix is nonnegative. our second contribution is provided by a polynomial - time algorithm, which is actually a linear program, and which allows us to employ the well known interior point method for testing the effectiveness of the implementers. in the context of the multiple transmitters model, this algorithm can be formulated as a ( non - convex ) problem, which can be solved elegantly by casting it as an optimization problem, as in program. it can also be employed, in a similar manner, to test the performance of the program in scenarios where the receiver has a large number of affectors ( transmitters ), while the receiver only has a single active supporter.
the kinematics of the undoubtably the final stage of the evolution of a planetary nebula, ngc 7293, are investigated with australian ( 3.9 m ) telescope pv arrays of [ oiii ] 5007 and [ nii ] 6584 emission lines. a detailed comparison is made with previously published hst images of the nebula of the central star, odell & handron ( 1996 ). the heii 6560 enclosed within the bi - polar central shell is found to be well resolved and kinematically consistent with the final stages of the red giant ( rg ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phases of the star s evolution. the possibility that the fast wind that was initially created by the star in an attempt to resolve the nebular structure is considered and is shown to be a plausible solution. the origin of the radial ` spokes ', that are prominent in the bright helical nebulosity and extending to to within 30 of the core, is discussed. possible origins of these spokes are discussed. furthermore, models of the bi polar / toroidal nebula are compared with the latest high resolution acs / lris imaging of this central region. it is shown that a large volume, @xmath0 70 radii, containing the known cometary globules is expanding radially within the central torus at the rate of 14.3. this is in good agreement with the very simple dynamical models for the creation of planetary nebulae. the model predicts a very clumpy configuration of the innermost part of the circumstellar material as a result of the interaction of the toroid with its many times denser ` cometary'knots. the clumpy nature of the structure means that the optical emission from the central region is blocked effectively in its outermost regions, preventing the direct ionisation of the lobes by the diffuse ionised radiation field. the axisymmetric shape of the model is then expected to be modified as a consequence of this bow shock / fast wind interaction. various effects including bulk turbulence, thermal motion and radiation pressure due to the ionising radiation field are also considered. to appear in _ the astrophysical journal _, vol. 495, 10 september 2004.

the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by integral has opened a new astrophysical setting for our understanding of the astrophysical processes leading to the formation of a black hole and the emission of grbs. we can follow in great detail not only the initial grb energy spectrum, but also the entire temporal structure of the grb emission from the prompt emission to the latest afterglow phases. we obtain for the first time a very good agreement between our theoretical spectral analysis and the observations in the case of grb 031203 observed by integral. in addition, we predict very precisely the detailed dynamics of the process which sets in at the horizon of the black hole, for which we obtain a very accurate analytical expression of the exact analytic solution of the equations of motion. we then examine the possibility of formulating a general relativistic model for grbs by adopting, after suitable space - time transformations, a planckian distribution for the time - integrated spectra in the observer frame. this model has a very large redundancy built in. any departures from the correct theoretical treatment in this very complex system manifest themselves in the observations. it is so that, as the model is properly developed and verified, its solution will have existence and uniqueness. in order to check the correctness of our analytical results, we have found necessary to establish clear guidelines by introducing three basic paradigms for the interpretation ofgrbs. the first one, the paradigm of ` ` the fireshell in the livermore code '', covers three fundamental issues important for understanding the new physics of gravitationally collapsed objects and allowed to the publication of a very popular article : the ` ` black hole uniqueness theorem ''. this ansatz, still today after thirty years, is still the only consistent paradigm to describe grb structure. + * a ) * the existence of a grb model and the subsequent emission and the characterization of its most general black hole is a problem of a great deal of current interest and, possibly, future importance for astrophysics. the second paradigm is relevant for the issue of the presence or absence of jets. in this specific case, we are able to show that, among all the possible highly nonlinear nonlinear terms, only the ones corresponding solely to the einstein maxwell theory survive as the outcome of the gravitational collapse process. as a by - product we obtain, in the field of general relativity, the luminosity emitted in a fixed energy band and the photon number spectrum starting from the hypothesis that we can hypothesis that the radiation emitted in the
the infrared background ( ebl ) at 15@xmath0 m is a fossil record of the light radiated by galaxies since their formation. most of the ebl is due to luminous infrared galaxies, which however have not yet been detected in the mid - infrared ( mir ). a new technique, based on the isocam camera, has been used to detect dusty starbursts up to @xmath1 1. we present results from two deep extragalactic surveys : the cfrs-14 and the chandra x - ray observatories in the lockman hole and hdfn respectively. it is found that the fraction of galaxies with star formation rates higher than ( 10 - 60 ) % is very small and that the main source of the mir light is star formation and not accretion around a black hole. this result is confirmed by the optical and ir observations. moreover, we demonstrate that the mir luminosities at 6.75, 12 and 15@0 m are strongly correlated with each other and with the bolometric ir luminosity for local galaxies. this suggests that the boundary photon index at many wavelengths between these two samples is small, unless the galaxies sample a very large population of galaxies. the infrared galaxy luminosity density, calculated by fitting the number counts of galaxies detected in both surveys, is more consistent with the local value than with the mir one. based on our results, we suggest that the deepest optical and near - infrared surveys, available at present, are the most efficient at detecting the galaxies responsible for the cirb. the proposed optical technique, which has been widely used in the study of starburst galaxies, is finally presented. address = isecam, piazzale della repubblica 10, 65122, pescara, italy, email=katia.rodriguez@pleo.fr address = wsrt, hasselt planet science laboratory, 1 story, california institute of technology, pasadena, ca 91125, usa address = sicomp, universidad de mxico, depto. de fsica, p.o. box 1663, das javes, nm 87528 mxica, altaddress = departamento de astronomia, universidade federal do rio grande do norte, ca 95058, natal, rn, brazil
we report on our recent global three - dimensional simulations of the interaction of a supersonic wind with a non - uniform radiative cloud. our main goal is to investigate the possible survival mechanism of a cloud accelerated by a hot freely expanding wind. we consider two different cloud geometries, which enable us to fully investigate the initial shape and structure of the cloud on its subsequent evolution. our global simulations found that soft x - rays can arise from ( i ) mass - loading from ablated clouds, ( ii ) the intermediate temperature interface between the hot wind and cool filaments, ( iii ) bow shocks upstream of clouds accelerated into the outflow, and ( iv ) interactions between these bow shocks. we have performed a detailed resolution study of the wind / cloud interaction. our simulations were performed on the sgi altix computer operated by the australian partnership for advanced computing. we find that a cloud with a more uniform density distribution survives longer than an identical adiabatic cloud. this is a direct result of further resolving the kelvin - helmholtz instability, which grows more quickly at shorter wavelengths. we also find that the mass flux increases with increasing numerical resolution. from our simulations we reconfirm the fact that a tenuous cloud can not form filaments with densities as high as those observed in starburst - driven winds. we confirm the formation of the filamentary structure described in paper i by our definition of the ram - pressure as the key mechanism for the collimation of cloudlets into structures. however, in order for this to be a viable mechanism, either the wind breaks up the cloud into many small clouds, or the dense clouds entrained by the flow have been entrained into the stream. in order to understand which mechanisms are most important, we perform a direct comparison between the results of our models and those found in previous studies that implement radiative cooling in their simulations. we conclude that thermal conduction may be the best means of protecting a cloud from the destructive kinematic instability.

we report the results of molecular line observations of ngc1068 with the spire and photodetector array camera and spectrometer, which have revealed the presence of a giant x - ray - dominated region ( xdr ) in this prototypical starburst galaxy. in particular we have detected for the first time the j = 1 - 0 transition of hydrogen fluoride in the local universe, characteristic of all the heavy element groups common to the milky way. in addition, three fine - structure lines, including the two lines from neutral carbon and the [ nii]205 @xmath0 m line, have been detected, in addition to the three atomic lines observed with the _ herschel_-spire fts in absorption in m82, the ulirg arp220, and the coverleaf quasar at z=2.56. we have analyzed the origin of the j=1 - 0 lines by fitting them with radiation transfer models which include a two - component component, associated with the circum - nuclear region ( cnd ) and a medium excitation component, which accounts for the water - like molecules and excitation region ( me ). the me component of the cnd is found to have a kinetic temperature of 40@xmath1 k, a mass of m(h@xday2 ) n(7 - 30 @xida ) @xiff2, and a density of n(9 - 10@xiff3 @xfig0 @xft4 @xld with a volume density n(n - 10)_up to 10(17 - 30 ) _, similar to the regions found in ulirgs mrk231 and m82. the radiation transfer model fits to the data do not exclude, but do not constrain, the two components responsible for the excitation of the co, as well as the contributions from other partially extended molecular lines, which should be detected with future submillimetre telescopes. a cnd contribution of 0.2 - 1 % is suggested by the observed and predicted co surface brightness, while a contribution from a pure rotational co component ( i.e., non - thermal excitation ) is also possible. the overall picture that emerges from our molecular line study is that of two or more components, with different contributions from the uv through xdr regions, in a process that can only be satisfactorily understood in the context of the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model.
time - reversal symmetry, which breaks under time - reversal conditions, is a fundamental property of nature. here, we show that actuation of non - deforming particles under oscillating fields is possible without the need for anisotropic drag. the concept, which is illustrated by analytic and numerical simulations, is transfer from a single sd - particle to particles that form a two - dimensional cluster. within the cluster, the translation of particles is possible but it requires a multi - component object ( cluster ). it is shown that this concept can be adapted to describe effectively a swarm of interacting sd - particles in a ring. furthermore, we demonstrate that the interparticle interaction gives rise to a non - reciprocal translation, which can be controlled by the magnetic configuration of a cluster. this concept applies to any system that is actuated by an oscillating field and is the basis for a new concept of collective behavior described by the group velocity field @xcite. in the recent years, there has been a great interest in the collective motion of many different types of microscopic objects. passive particles, which move in the @xmath0 plane, exhibit translational and rotational patterns. in contrast, collective motion is defined as the motion of two or more components, called clusters, within a spatial space that is not necessarily empty. collective motion in real space is achieved by transferring the degrees of freedom of each component from one component to its nearest vicinity or by subjecting the particles to a net magnetic field. recently, it has been experimentally realized that actuated clusters can be formed by soft magnetic measurements, which periodically change the magnitude and position of the field. in this paper, we extend the concepts of collective motion to the situation when interacting particles are oscillated by an external field. as an example, a sphere with a central dipole performs flip - flops while its side facing a wall is rotated by an infinitesimal angle, which leads to time - reversed translation. in a highly viscous environment, however, the hindrance between interacting particles depends solely on the amplitude of the external field and does not depend on the orientation of the particle center. we have addressed this problem by considering the role of magnetic asymmetry on the translation. if the magnetic center of a sphere is shifted away from the geometric center of the sphere, resulting in a change of the translation direction, then the dipole can follow the field via reciprocal oscillations. however, for particles with a shifted point dipole, the direction of these oscillations is not symmetric with respect
we present new hst / acs photometry of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies in the perseus cluster, combining these with previous data from the antlia, fornax, and virgo clusters and the local group. we investigate the relation between v - band absolute magnitude and several structural parameters of early - type galaxies, such as the half - light radius, the srsic exponent @xmath0, the central surface brightness, and the v@xmath1 colour. the results are in line with previous photometric studies. as a possible explanation for the power - law behaviour of the v -band absolute magnitude, we consider the luminosity - metallicity relation of galaxies that have not yet started to form stars. we find that the relation is broken down by the presence of ensembles or groups at a larger distance from the central galaxy. this leads to a breakdown of the photometric scaling relations with both luminosity and environment. on the other hand, when one considers the density - morphology relation, the relations are in a good agreement with recent numerical simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation. it is likely that there is an underlying unity in the physics driving the formation and evolution of stellar systems, with the environment playing a role that is in many situations subordinate to that of internal processes. epsf.sty # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 1 # 1 to size # 1 = to size = eufm10 scaled2 = cmbx10 scaled1 = cmr7 scaled2 psfig.sty [ firstpage ] galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : dwarf galaxies : clusters : general
we present a spectroscopic study of the star formation history and chemical evolution of the early galactic population residing in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. we have obtained multi - slit low resolution spectra of 226 rr lyrae stars and 3 anomalous cepheids in a 15@xmath0 area around the galaxy centre using fors2 at the vlt, covering the 3450 - 5900 wavelength range. we find that the average luminosity, metal abundance and range in metal abundance of these ancient stellar populations are similar to those of other old stellar populations in sculptor, such as the horizontal branch stars and the old galactic globular clusters ngc 3201 and ngc 6171. however, a significant dispersion is found in the dispersion of their average luminosities ( @xmath1 mag ), which can be explained in terms of a metallicity spread of the stars, being equal to 0.6 dex. as a more plausible scenario for the chemical enrichment history of sculptor we postulate that the early stellar components in this galaxy were almost entirely concentrated in their present location. the abundance distribution and size of the metal - enriched portion of the sample are consistent with the old, metal - poor stellar populations that inhabited the galaxy blue - horizontal branch a few gyr ago, and that formed most of its stars before the start of the recent galactic merger. the large spread in metallicities is also supported by the bimodality in the spatial distribution of the ancient sculptor red giant branch ( hb ) stars, which shows an abrupt change in its distribution at about 12 arcmin from the galaxy center, which is modelled on the change in the hb distribution observed for red giants in @xcite and inferred from high resolution spectroscopy of red giants. the blue horizontal branch component of the galaxy is found to be significantly over - abundant with respect to the metal spread, most probably due to the contribution of the old metal - rich population. within the uncertainties in the upper limit of the present analysis, we can not rule out a scenario in which the red hb giant branch and the early metal enrichment were both due to an inter - stellar system, but not due to systematic effects.

we investigate formation of massive star clusters ( vymcs ) through subcluster merging in a turbulent molecular gas cloud. the subclusters are envisioned to fall onto each other from close initial separations ( @xmath0 ) and to merge collectively after evolving for a few myr. we evolve the above initial configurations using the state - of - the art nbody6 code. the background plummer gas potential, if present, is the dominant component of the global potential well. during the infall and the merger process, the potential well of the system changes with time but the final virialized stellar distribution and the global minimum of the final potential well must be concentric for an energetically stable configuration. the timescales for the merge and the expansion of the merged cluster, if any, can be substantially longer than the dynamical time of the proto - stars initially in the core - halo configuration. we show that the resulting cluster profile and kinematics of the observed hd97950 can be fairly and optimally reproduced either by a monolithic initial stellar distribution or by a cluster that has formed promptly ( in a short time ) from a sub - cluster. the latter confirms the observed properties of the cluster. we also explore the effects of a background gas potential. the model of kinematic infall and of star formation efficiency consistently predicts the presence of residual gas after the merging process. if the model is correct, the cluster will have an stellar mass function ( imf ) that is nearly uniform within a given half - mass radius ( given the background potential ). this would be consistent with the observed slope of the proper imf and with the lower stellar mass limit. furthermore, the model would have difficulty in reproducing the observed surface mass density profile of hd 97950, implying that the imf is truncated. for the latter case, a substantial residual gas expulsion ( by mass ) is essential for getting the observed profile right. we apply these results to the formation of rcw 38 in the large magellanic cloud and to the central cluster of the galactic ` ` giant nebula '' ngc 3603.

we calculate the dark matter ( dm ) distribution in the centre of the @xmath0cen cluster of galaxies, considering the most promising dark matter candidates for probing the cusp of its intergalactic medium, weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ). the possibility that a massive black hole might be hiding in the core of the cluster strongly impacts the estimation of the dm distribution around it. we use recent high angular resolution hst spectroscopy of the central region to estimate the density of stars in the cluster, in particular the presence of an imbh. we find that the stellar density profile around the black hole is shallower than that expected from baryonic evolution models with a nfw profile, although not necessarily by as much as a factor of five. from the current stellar kinematics, we estimate that the blackbody - dominated dm halo has a total mass of about 0.2m@xmath1 and the mass of the initial dm subhalo could be as high as 0.8m@xcite. in this case, the wd - to - photon flux ratio could be higher, up to 2, than that for a milky way - like galaxy, as suggested by the small amount of observed near the cluster center. we also consider a scenario where the imbh is not completely stripped, but in fact, there is a nuclear star cluster remnant at its center, suggesting that it is a globular cluster or a small dwarf spheroidal cluster. using the most of the existing photometric properties of this type of cluster, we argue that it might be a good candidate for the core dark matter cusp, although it is not clear as to whether or not there is enough dark matter there. the large fraction of main - sequence stars within the central cluster radius allows us to disentangle the competing effects of dm heating and cooling. we discuss observational predictions and compare them with the most recent theoretical predictions.

merlin and hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of the nearby, low - redshift radio galaxy 3c305 have revealed the presence of a dust lane and a peculiar shaped radio lobe, suggestive of the capture of interstellar medium by the accreting galaxy. the kinematics of the gas and the radio jet are intimately linked. the neutral hydrogen absorption is localised on scales of @xmath0120 pc from the southwest jet and lobe, indicating that the neutral gas is in front of the radio structure. however, no absorption is detected against the much stronger northeast lobe despite the obvious presence of dust lanes. we interpet as evidence that the northeast lobe is behind the dust lane. merlin hi absorption observations are used to determine the column density of neutral hydrogen at the position of the southwest lobe. the results are consistent with the idea that the radio emission is directed along the jet, away from the observer, while the emission lines trace a circular path around the nucleus. this suggests that the active nucleus is undergoing discuration by the ionised gas and that dust may be obscuring the central 0.210@xmath210 arcsec in radius. although the shape of the central region is not well understood, we hypothesise that the nucleus is surrounded by dust and that the obscuring torus is a result of hard uv radiation from the central agn. we have also used hst images of the [ oiii ] emission line to provide a new constraint on the distribution of dust and gas in the central 6.5 arcsec of the galaxy. we find that the optical dust to gas ratio is close to its canonical value of 0.2, which indicates that most of the dust in the galaxy is bound up in dust lanes rather than being captured in a specific structure. the low neutral hydrogen column density and the apparent disc - like geometry of the overall galaxy suggest that obscuration may not be the primary mechanism for forming the central active nucleus, although it may be an effect of photoionization of high energy photons by the uv - excited dust lane in the centre of the active galaxy.3c305 is an example of a galaxy harbouring too much of central activity. its radio morphology is remarkably similar to that of nearby elliptical galaxies, suggesting that active galaxies harbour more compact radio structures than normal galaxies. -0.4 in [ firstpage ] galaxies : active galaxies : jets galaxies : ism radio continuum : galaxies
the quantum memory encoded in the majorana modes of a @xmath0-wave superconductor is known to be fragile to impurities. here we study the effect of proximity effect on the decoherence of the quantum memory. we find that it is possible to excite quasi - particles with energies just above the proximity - induced gap according to the fermi golden rule. this effect is by itself infectious to the whole superconducting system. institute for theoretical physics, chinese academy of sciences, beijing 100190, china department of physics and astronomy, mississippi state university, carnegie mellon university, university park, ms 39762, usa.@xcite in the last decade, there has been a great interest in the quantum nature of many - body systems. superconductivity ( sec ) @xcite is one of the most promising materials to encode quantum information because it is a non - trivial and well - defined order parameter. in this respect, it has been more and more scrutinized as a building block to build a quantum computer. although the current interest in superconductors is driven by the necessity to cut the cost of the construction, a fundamental requirement for the performance of the architecture is its robustness against impurities and fluctuations in the material properties. this is known as the strength of the gap since a weak defect can destroy the superconducted order. indeed, the gap is strong enough to form a spin - gap leading to time - reversal symmetry breaking through the pairing degeneracy. a majorana wire, having the geometry of a gap, is one such physical structure which is well - suited for the purpose of quantum information processing. several different realizations of majorana wires have been proposed in the literature, the most notable one being the toric code in 2d, which has been shown to be robust even in the presence of disorder ( _ e.g. _, imperfect contacts with an external wire, or quantum scattering of the quasiparticles ). recently, a new kind of wire based on a half - filled conduction ring has been proposed, which is robust against disorder and has a very long coherence length thanks to the symmetry of the two majorana wavefunctions. however, in this work we will show that the length of the wire does not seem to be a sufficient condition for the stability of the big blue bump. in general, we will find that the eigenstates of the one - dimensional bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg )

the random trajectory of a round flagellar bacteria in a rotating field is analysed. it is shown that in the synchronous regime the magnetic moment of the swimmer rotates with the angular velocity of the field. at small times the motion of the bacterium is ballistic due to random switching of the direction of rotation of a rotary motor. at large times it is described by a power spectrum of curvature fluctuations. this relation is used to analyse the properties of random swimming trajectories of the around swimmers. the estimated diffusion coefficient for a range of switching rates is obtained as a function of the ratio of the switching rate to the frequency of the rotating field. another indication for the frequency dependence of the diffusion coefficient is provided by a comparison of a stochastic trajectory observed in the experiment with a simulation of the poisson process. one of the most important classes of swimmers is the circle swimmer. a swimmer is said to be a circle if in the large times its direction of motion is ballistic. in order to describe the swimming direction and in the small times by a closed set of equations for the curvature center of a swimming trajectory one may introduce a periodic or quasi - periodic switching rate, which is a linear combination of the doppler speed and gradient. the aim of a particle analysis is to find the characteristics of such periodic trajectories and to study their properties. line - of - sight trajectories were first considered by frenet et al. in @xcite they introduced the concept of circle swimmers and described their motion as a collection of circles, according to the fokker - planck equation. they defined a circle trajectory as an arc of circles with radius @xmath0. later on, also swimmers with curves, which have the same radius dependence as the circular trajectory, were considered and conclusions were drawn about the direction and times of switching rate depending on the relative magnitudes of their curvature centers. the relation of circular trajectory with mean displacement and mean square displacement was obtained by j. stasheff, phys. rev. e * 80 *, 026302 ( 2004 ). it was later confirmed by n. krasznahorkay and c. w. spasibskii, _ evolution of solitary bacteria _ ( nova science, new york, 1998 ). the effect of torqued swimmers on the statistics of flagella pendulum, pose a great challenge for theoretical and numerical methods. a particular example for this problem was considered in
we present the results of a detailed analysis of the x - ray properties of a sample of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies observed using _ asca _ sis and sis1. we find that the 0.0 to 10.0 kev continuum in most of the sample can be well represented by a powerlaw with an index of @xmath0, and that the emission features due to highly - ionized fe and other elements are typically detectable in the 6.47.1 kev band in at least half of the sources. the underlying continuum in some sources shows evidence for a significant curvature, which can be represented, in certain cases, by an additional powerlaw component of energy - dependent slope. we show that the best - fitting parameters are likely to be the effective temperature of the absorbing gas, the column density of the gas, and the location of the emitting region relative to the primary continuum. in the majority of sources the ionized absorber is a single component which is associated with the accretion disk, although in several objects a two - component model with a compton - reflection component or a second absorbing gas component is required to represent the absorbing material. we demonstrate, however, that the true number of absorbers is in fact often far fewer absorbers than expected from a single absorber, particularly in the case of ngc 3516. we discuss the origin of these different components in detail, and demonstrate that allowing for multiple absorbers in the 210 kev regime is necessary in order to derive reliable parameters for the stability of the various components. we also consider the importance of spectral fitting methods, such as those which allow for the inclusion of the contribution from other, thermal and non - thermal emission ( e.g. from oblique absorption lines ). in many cases it is found that these two absorption components are correlated with the variable optical emission features seen in the uv. we suggest that in some cases the co - existence of two or more warm, optically thick absorbers may be the cause of the observed variability in the optical. = -0.5 cm [ firstpage ] galaxies : active galaxies : individual : mcg-6 - 30 - 15 galaxies : jets and outflows x - rays : galaxies
we used the akari fis bright source catalog to construct the local infrared ( ir ) luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies. this is the first attempt to use an ir lf, which is several times larger than previous work, to measure the peak of the dust emission in the fir wavelength and thus the @xmath0 luminosity of galaxies, and thereby to base our cosmological evolution studies at high redshift both by the current akari, spitzer, and herschel satellites and by next - generation ir satellites such as wise, jwst, and spica. we found cross - matches of 2357 galaxies, with which we will measure ir lfs. among these, 97, 98, and 87 % of sources the number of galaxies used are similar to iras, despite the twice increase in the optical ( sdss ) sample. from the spitzer survey and galex survey, we will also compare the agn fraction as a function of redshift. in our first paper, we measured the optical line - ratio of agn ( active galactic nuclei ) and star - forming galaxies ( sfg ). after adding the galaxies considered in this paper to the sdss agn sample, we cross - correlated the kron et al. ( 2002 ) extended survey with the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ). the two samples have similar line - ratios and redshifts, suggesting there is no significant contamination from agn in the observations. in addition, we compared the fis and wise infrared luminosity functions with the galaxy spectral energy distributions fitted by different sed models. we find the best fit with a simple power - law, although the chel ( chemical evolution models without seds ) fits the data better. more detailed sed fits will be presented in a forthcoming paper. among the 1710,000 optically - selected agn based on the optical spectra, 905,000 show dominant agn emission, with agn fractions ranging from 4.9@xmath1/\alpha$ ] to 9.1@xfig.7/\beta$ ]. the results show the majority ( 96 % ) of the total ir luminosity is emitted by sfg, while only 4.8 % is produced by agn at z=0.031, in contrast to previous findings. considering the redshift evolution and uncertainties in the sed fitting, the present data still supports the fact that agn contribution is already negligible in the lirgs range.
we present a detailed study of the interstellar matter in the nearby low luminosity radio galaxy ngc 4410a and its companions, and compare its properties with those of other radio galaxies. using the vla and nrao 12 m telescope, we mapped the radio continuum emission, the 21 cm hi line, and the surface brightness brightness in the vicinity of the interacting galaxy pair ngc4410a+b. our mapping of the hi line brightness confirms the presence of a double - lobed, symmetric structure in this galaxy, as seen in previous observations of this system. the second lobe is severely distorted, with a size of @xmath05@xmath1 ( 180 kpc ), and is aligned with the optical ring around the nucleus. we also find a very large ( 45 kpc = 120 kpc, diameter ; 90 kpc=1.0 ) ` tail'of radio emission extending to the east and west. a single - sided x - ray outflow, likely of starburst or quasar origin, is seen near the eastern edge of the radio lobe. we infer an upper limit to the mass of hot gas in this group of around 40 %, based on hi flux densities consistent with the virial mass of the group. the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion of this group is about 2.8 times the local sound speed. we discuss the implications of these observations in the context of the galaxy merger, and conclude that this galaxy - galaxy merger is probably the result of a cluster - cluster merger, rather than an encounter with an intracluster medium. the galaxy group is a remarkably small group of galaxies, consisting of only five of which are strongly interacting, and these galaxies have been caused by the interaction with an external medium, either interstellar gas or gas related to the galaxies. the disturbance of this radio structure was probably caused by an encounter between the interstellar gas and the intracuster medium, although the present observations can not rule out the possibility that the distorted radio structure is caused by a collision or close encounter.
we provide a semiclassical trace formula for an @xmath0 anosov flow with nondegenerate periodic orbits which does not depend on the period of the flow. the trace formula is derived using ideas and results from microlocal analysis. in particular, we find a bound on the volume of the set of trajectories which return to their originating point after a given time. we also provide a self - contained proof of the theorem of baladi relating the number of closed trajectories to the slope of the resolvent of a flow. then we consider the meromorphic continuation of the original flow. as a first application, we provide a microlocal description of the microlocal structure of the continuation and prove some results on it. for example, we show that for sufficiently regular distributions the wave front set at radial sources is controlled. pacs numbers : : 89.75.hc ; 89.65.jh ; 90.40.+s. one of the most active lines of research in the history of physics is the study of flow anisotropies @xcite. an important example is the buzek and zee ( 1981 ) which proved that the divergence of ruelle zeta functions in incompressible nonlinear systems is a property of flow invariant submanifolds of compact manifolds. they defined the divergence as the ratio of the size of a divergent set of divergence products of divergent components of the same set with respect to the divergence product of their divergence products in terms of the divergence products themselves. another important instance was the finding the fredholm property of the schartz - yang divergences in differential forms ( *??? * theorem 1, sec. 4, p.279 ), which states that for large enough sets of divergence ratios and divergence functions the divergent sets converge to zero. in the case of divergence, the divergence has been measured in various way and the estimates ( for example using pde methods ) have proved in various contexts. in this paper, for the first time, we use microlocally defined exponential weights to provide a set of bound microlocal properties for the wave fronts of principal component ( re)@xmath1 flows with periodic orbits. the importance of microlocal measures of flow properties is discussed in the appendix by comparing the results obtained in the present paper with baladi s. we should mention that the results of guillemin, baladi, and baladi are all consistent with each other and with the conclusions in the
we present silicon - on - insulator waveguides with built - in edge coupling. the devices are fabricated using unibond@xmath0 smartcut materials, characterized by a @xmath1 integrated field. the inverse design process is used to characterize the devices, with structure optimized while allowing the permittivity to continuously vary ( linear parameterization ). we describe the fabrication and characterization procedures and provide insight into the financial nature of the devices. silicon, with a strong spin - orbit interaction, is one of the most promising materials for low - power electronics @xcite. in the last decade, silicon has reached a substantial maturity as a device platform. in 2013, photonics research group identified a new class of photonic devices, based on the organic electrical polarization of the silicon surface. in 2015, cryogenic group of nanophotonics was identified, leading to a new generation of integrated devices based on broadband light - emitting diodes. conceptually, these devices are similar to light emitting diode ( led ) devices with a fiber - coupled fiber in the case below. here, we present the characterization of these devices and their efficiency. we address the question of device efficiency by determining the number of photons that are needed to yield a given device. our analysis shows that the length of the conduction lane in silicon is not large enough to neglect the importance of conduction at the scale of the device, and it is this thin thickness that leads us to consider a broadband optimization method. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix # 2 # 1dag@dag.res.in,@page # 1dual@dhu.ac.uk, ryuji.box@pika.edu 0.5 cm k. srinivasan and o. painter, ` ` ultrafast single - photon diode with gpu - accelerated maxwell s equations, '' appl. phys. lett. * 90 *, 077010 ( 2010 ). h. takahashi, _ optical waveguide theory _ ( chapman & hall, new york, 2000 ). y. kawakami, _ quantum optics _ ( springer - verlag, 2006 ). i. shimokawa, w. kobayashi, and m. a. koshio,``vertical optical beam transfer from a silicon single - crystal nanocavity to a gpu '' opt. express * 15 *, 14601462 ( 2007 ). k. yoshida,
we present a detailed re - analysis of the star cluster system in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ), based on new photometry of the central 1020@xmath0 of h03 obtained from the massey ( 2002 ) ccd survey. using a monte - carlo numerical simulation of the lmc, we investigate the parameter space over which the characteristic disruption time - scale @xmath1 can be reliably retrieved from the integrated cluster mass distribution ( or the distribution of points in poissonnian error bars ). in this test we consider star clusters characterised by constant cold dark matter flat core masses ( cfrs ), assumed to evolve with time to a present - day of about 5 gyr. to this end, we first re - determine the fiducial detection limit above which the cluster sample is ( fairly ) complete from the cosmic microwave background finite element ( cmf ) finite, in order to avoid severe incompleteness effects. we then explore the sensitivity of the observed cluster cfr to variations in the initial mass distribution, the shape of the cluster mass function ( cfr ), and the presence of the secular dynamical cas ( i.e., aging - driven secular evolution ). when the faint end slope of the cfr is known, we find that the observed lmc cluster distribution can be reproduced to better than about 0.3 clusters per 10 myr for a cfr spanning 3 gyr in time. for a cluster of this mass, the best - fit cfr has a shape of 0.9 gyr ago, with an overall shape consistent with an increase in cfr over time of about 100 per cent. infant mortality and infant weight loss scenarios can not contribute significantly to the variation in the observed cfr, while secular evolution can not, on the whole, account for the observed properties of the icmf. we conclude that the well - established age - metallicity degeneracy between the present day cfr and the cluster disruption scaling with respect to the detection limit can not be accounted for by a linear relation other than the fading - driven turn - over in the integrated cmf. further, because of the bright detection limit, we are able to exclude the possibility that the present distribution of lmc clusters may not be a faithful mirror of the underlying cfr in the long run. we show that the absence of significant cluster disruption at intermediate and old age implies that the most likely scenario for the onset of cluster disruption in clusters with cfr turns - over is
we report the first detection of h i lines in circumstellar disks. using the _ spitzer _ heritage archive we have re - reduced the short - high ( sh ) spectra of disks - bearing young stars acquired in the standard staring mode and which have multiple on - source exposures ( n - cycle @xmath0 and sky observations ). in particular we find that debris disks have lower h i line and continuum luminosities than typical full disk disks. we also find that the h i(7 - 6 ) line is always tracing the same disk region as the [ ne ii ] line, and that it is not tracing an outflow originating from the inner circumstellar disk or the photosphere of the accretion disk. instead, we observe a strong correlation between the luminosity of the hr7(610610 ) line and the mass accretion rate ; this correlation is similar to that found by hartmann et al. for the pf@xmath1 series in the near - infrared ( nir ). these results not only suggest that h i and the other commonly observed mid - ir hydrogen lines trace accretion, but also suggest that these lines are produced by hot gas with a relatively high hydrogen column density ( as expected in accretion funnels ). another way we have employed to investigate the chromospheric origin of the hydrogen lines is to consider the effect of uv - excess emission on the measured accretion luminosity. finally, we also discuss the origin of water - contaminated disks. in fact, our analysis shows that the absence of water emission in the sh module is typical for more evolved transitional and debris disks, while full disks can either have a water - rich spectrum or not. we note that, as for full and transitional disks, the detection of the mid - ic lines in the _spitzer _ spectrum of debris disks can not, strictly speaking, be ruled out.
in the near future, we will start to see more and more examples of short - period wolf - rayet / x - ray binaries with neutron stars as companions. these systems are expected to be the outcome of the later evolution of black - hole and/or neutron star companions in which the evolved massive donor stars in these systems start to overflow their roche lobes and become close binaries, consisting of a supergiant donor star and a compact star. we consider the expected mass ratio of the compact star to the donor star, and we show that some of these systems may be in the common envelope evolution. we will show that the most likely scenario for this kind of evolution is that in systems with a donor star with a radiative envelope, a common envelope will form above the radiative boundary when the star begins to overflow its roche lobe. this allows the systems to enter a common - envelope evolution, and the final episode of mass transfer may lead to spiral - in, where the orbital period of the system is significantly reduced. in this case, the surviving companion will be a black hole of mass @xmath0 and has a mass of order 10@xmath1. there are only a few other neutron - star binaries known with such large black hole companions, and most of them have been thought to be so due to the fact that the one close companion is a wr star of type wn5. for these systems, we suggest the possibility of formation of a ` ` double - neutron '', a rare case in which both the neutron star and the black hole have the same mass, and both of them may be close binaries. if this is the case, there is a sudden decrease of the orbital periods of the two stars coincident with the end of the roche - lobe overflow, and an opportunity for neutron star formation. binaries : close stars : binaries stars : individual : ss433 stars : neutron stars : white dwarfs x - rays : binaries
we present the results from a detailed abundance analysis of three isolated and normal a - type stars in the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy sextansa based on high resolution spectra obtained at the eso / vlt using uves. the stellar data constitute a record of the star formation history of the galaxy over the last 15gyr. the mean metallicity of the three stars is found to be @xmath0\right>=-0.99\pm0.04\rm 0.06}$ ] which makes these three stars the to date the most metal - poor massive stars in any galaxy to date. their red giant branch ( rgb ) stars are of great importance due to their large spread in age. we find that iron and chromium are produced in sne of high and low mass stars, respectively. the ti abundances are derived from a large number of lines of the dominant ionization stage of singly ionized titanium and are in good agreement with iron. for the first time, we derive individual iron - group abundances, which suggest that the present - day iron group abundance is very small in comparison with predicted nebular abundances. we examine the chemical homogeneity of this young galaxy. the spatial distribution of abundances shows a hint of chemical inhomogeneities i.e., there are regions where the elements of interest have not yet had time to mix with the interstellar medium and thus are less likely to be produced in situ in a low mass stellar population. on the other hand, the general dependence of the abundance trends on the stellar parameters is small, most of the abundances being derived from analyses of the nebular emission lines of regions not available in the studies of local group galaxies. we show that the @xcite and [ o / fe ] ratios are similar in all three stars, indicating that the chemical mixing of the newly produced elements and their subsequent redistribution through the ism is almost independent of the age and abundance spread in the galaxy.

we develop a model to handle the high - frequency dynamics of market orders. in the limit order book ( lob ), market makers formulate as impulse controls the time evolution of limit orders, as well as the market spread, which is modelled as a discrete time stationary markov process. the agent relying on the control is assumed to be small, in the sense that she does not influence the bid - ask spread. the limit orders are executed when they meet incoming counterpart market orders, which completely match the limit sell and limit buy orders of the small agent. we study in detail classical frameworks including mean - variance criterion and exponential utility criterion, and present direct calibration results for all quantities involved in the model. we formulate in detail the optimal market making control problem, and derive the associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman quasi variational inequality from dynamic programming principle. we show how one can reduce the number of state variables to the mid - price of the trading asset close to zero during the trading day, and often equilibrate the position on the risky asset. finally, we show that the execution risk, the risk that limit orders may not be executed, or be partially executed, comes from the fact that market orders may be delayed or even cancelled, which fundamentally impacts the dynamics of executions. * market making *, a. kuriyagawa, s. mori, and y. yamamoto, ` ` focus on the impact of increased liquidity on financial stability, '' j. stochastics * 10 *, 3345 ( 1995 ). g. p. agrawal, ( john wiley & sons, new york, ny 10025 ). * electronic trading of options in foreign exchange markets : a review *, n. liu, r. l. parameswaran, and s. c. dosanjh, _ econometric litterature _ ( princeton university press, princeton, nj 08544, 2008 ). m. uiberacker, m. erdmann, and m. zograff ` ` maximizing an angel s offering of liquidity to the market, '' quant quant. * 17 *, 609260 ( 2010 ). a. naylor, c. tatishvili, and c. d. whittaker ` ` monte carlo evaluation of the efficiency of a liquidity provider model, '' mon. not. r. soc. * 66 *, 871892 ( 2005 ). t. huber,
we develop a mathematical model of retinitis pigmentosa that tracks the progression of the disease through all stages and subtypes of this disease. the physical mechanisms of the interaction between the photoreceptors and trophic factors are explicitly modeled and incorporated. by varying between one and three parameters of the system, we can observe many different progressions of cone - rod rp and rod - cone rp. based on the stability conditions of the transcritical bifurcations, our model suggests that future physiological experiments and research should focus on the shedding and renewal of rods and cones for each class of photoreceptor ( @xmath0 ) as well as on the carrying capacity and location of the troppic factors secreted by the rpe. to the best of our knowledge, no experimental work has been done to date that discusses the production rate of trops in the _ absence _ of photoresceptors. our model offers a potential understanding of the mechanisms behind the various manifestations of rp through the transition from the weakly transcritical to the strongly transcritical regime and thus provides a potentially crucial advance in understanding this transition. * in retina pigmentosa, a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that affects approximately 1 in 4000 individuals worldwide, the primary progenitors are assumed to be normal rods that are expressed in plant cells. however, there is no rigorous diagnostic scheme to distinguish between a normal rod os and a mutated rod os ( so far ). in rp, this confusion is caused by a combination of mutations of the rods, their interaction with the cone os, and the removal of genetic contributions to the rods that cause their death. since rp research has so far not considered the genetic reason for the existence of these different types of mutations, we are not certain what the mutation(s ) that cause rp or what else the rp cause. in general, our work suggests to look for mechanisms that can halt or reverse rp without an apparent need for genetic mutations and that can be incorporated into current and future therapeutic approaches to the disease. *
we present a high - resolution simulation of the dynamical spiral - in phase of a common envelope common envelope ( ce ) event with the moving - mesh hydrodynamics ( arepo ) code. we consider a red giant ( rg ) model in which a fraction of the envelope is filled with a gravitation - only star ( ` ` core '' ). we also model a non - resolved, compact companion star. the arepo code solves the euler equations on a moving grid with adaptive resolution. this allows us to study the flow structure in unprecedented detail. large - scale shear flows develop and cause kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in the outer part of the spiral structure. the flow between the rg core and the companion remains smooth ; shocks begin outside the innermost region. in the simulations, the envelope ejects its envelope on a timescale of @xmath0d, caused by the initial plunge - in of the companion. the mass that is initially transferred to the companion is the sum of a stellar mass and a small amount of the red giant mass, which is the same as in standard stellar evolution models. the system remains co - rotating and the envelope develops turbulent convection in the early stages of its evolution. the central engine of the convection is a healpix shell with a density with a central protoplanet that rotates with a sub - keplerian velocity. this shell is unstable and breaks up into different mass shells. behind the shells, the flow is turbulent and shear features emerge. the direction of these flows is tangential, leading to strong perturbations and eventually to the end of the simulation. the fate of these small - scale features is uncertain in this phase.

we study the propagation of weakly nonlinear long waves in a periodically inhomogeneous waveguide, governed by the variable - coefficient korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation. using a perturbative expansion based on integral equations and direct numerical simulations, we show that, for the case when the dispersion undergoes a periodic change in sign, stable solitary - wave solutions are possible in a region defined by the average dispersion and the initial momentum of the system. further, it is shown that a sufficiently weak fifth - order dispersion, which, generally speaking, is small, does not destroy these solitary waves. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 g. i. stegeman and m. segev, _ optical fibers : molding the flow of light _ ( princeton university press, princeton, 1995 ). l. gilmozzi, ` ` propagation of solitary waves in nonlinear waveguides, '' j. lightwave technol. * 25*(12 ), 47504762 ( 1991 ). a. s. howell, r. r. heckenberg, and j. g. thompson, _ propagation of rossby waves and solitons _ ( academic press, rochester, 2007 ). d. m. greenberger, m. letttinger, a. shimony, d. meiser, and a. zeilinger,``resonant soliton streams in fiber - optic fibers, '' opt. commun. * 244 *, 11701173 ( 1994 ). k. mattle, h. weinfurter, p. julienne, and p. l. dumas,``advances in optical soliton propagation, '' jetp lett. * 26*(5 ), 590649 ( 1998 ). j. reithmaier, j. simonet, and k. nordholt, _ nonlinear optical waveguide concepts : analytical and numerical part i _ ( naucon, 2006 ). i. t. chanelire, e. biermann, and d. marpaung, _ dispersion - managed wave propagation in fiber networks : theory and numerical simulations _ ( optical society of america, 2010 ). m. szakll, s. krauss, i. v. konopacky, and n. a. salilov, _ numerical solution of
in this review we summarize the results of hera experiments on high energy hadron scattering, focusing on the region where the center of mass energy is significantly larger than the typical mass scale associated with hadron structure. we discuss the role of the bjorken scaling variable, @xmath0, for modeling the hadronic environment of the quarks and gluons participating in the hard process, and identify some specific ` ` consequences '' which are of particular importance in making the transition from hera to lhc. in particular, we study the ` ` black disk limit '' in high energy qcd simulations, in which the size of the transverse area of leading partons is substantially smaller than the area associated with the nucleon in soft ( hadronic ) interactions at high energies. this leads to a fast ` ` disappearance '' of the black disk coefficient in the qcd equation, and a ` ` rapidity gap '' for the growth of interaction with energy. we also study the diffractive processes underlying such high energy phenomena, such as the perturbative growth of the gluon density in the proton, the froissart bound in hadron elastic scattering, and the production of dijets with large transverse momenta or heavy particles ( higgs bosons, fermions ). some of these processes require a specific form of factorization, which is possible because of the smallness of the effective coupling constant in small space, which allows one to calculate their amplitudes using a technique called ` ` factorization a systematic separation into a hard quark hadron scattered ( dis ) ''. we outline the parameters under which unitarity of the scattering matrix is allowed to play a role in the analysis of diffractive data, as well as in the description of heavy diffraction at tevatron energies. we comment on the gains that can be made for studies of low transverse plane parton distributions in exclusive vector meson production processes at hera, using the method of ` ` pre qcd '', and discuss the opportunities for studying of small@xmath1 dynamics provided by the planned electron ion collider.
let @xmath0 be a group acting by isometries, coboundedly and acylindrically on a non - elementary geodesic metric space, whose action is a loxodromic one. we show that there is an injective class of conjugates to such an action, whose axes are bounded by the square of the distance of the subgroup. moreover we establish useful arithmetic properties of the action, as well as its non - trivial finitely generated subgroups. msc : 43a46, 47a56, 22d10 let @xma be an odd - dimensional non - abelian group, acting by eigenvalues of the normal group in a family of subgroups with one of the following properties : for any finitely generating subgroup, there exists an orthogonality class of generating subgroups whose axes have bounded intersection with each other. this is the first time that this property has been observed for any non - vanishing hyperbolic group. we also say that it is also the second and the third case, since the previous result follows from a symmetry breaking theorem of graham and graham. the semi - algebraic structure of any group is determined by its isometry, and the isometry and the action of the group are determined by it. thus the main result of this paper applies to groups with no finite normal group, and it is a consequence of the general equivalence principle that every group admitting an infinite irreducible normal group is end - bounding by an isometry that does not have a finite inverses in it. for some groups in general, this is true only for those whose isometry involves a central subgroup with a letter in the form of a preprint, where the first term is an elementary equation and the second term is conjugate multiplication. the case where both sides of a group are due to the same group isend ( see figure [ fig1 ] ). in this paper we establish some general relations between points in the space and the quotient group that can be used to probe the topology of groups with non - zero normal groups. these relations are sufficiently general to apply to the general case when all groups have finite normal subgroups, and in particular to the special cases where the normal groups are not finite. this paper is organized as follows. in section 1 we give a general introduction to the theory of quasi - geodesics, which will be useful for applications in combinatorics, representation theory, and
the dynamics of vortices and localized quasi - solitons in a rotating quasi - one - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - einstein condensate, in the quadratic axisymmetric trap, is considered. both quiescent and moving the motion, of the larmor ( cyclotron ) type, is imposed on them by the application of a kick, either by the 2d harmonic potential with frequency @xmath0, or by the 1d ramp potential. the trap is designed to be an anharmonic with respect to the rotation. phase diagrams of this model are investigated in detail, both in the mean - field approximation [ i.e., using the gross - pitaevskii equation and its linearization for small perturbations ], and in the framework of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations [ ii ]. it is shown that, for an appropriate set of parameters, stable localized patterns can be found in the lowest landau level ( lll ) under the anharmonicity of the trap. in this case, the instability threshold is crossed by the auxiliary 1d forcing term in the schrdinger equation. in the second setting, the relative strength of the two forcing terms is explicitly evaluated, by means of a numerical diagonalization of the many - body bosonic hamiltonian. the obtained stationary solutions for the system are further compared with variational approximations, and it is demonstrated that they match well the observed locations of the nonlinear lll modes in the parameter space of the effective lagrangian. this work also highlights the critical role played by the angular velocity in the van der waals variational approximation [ va ] in our approach. using this va, we demonstrate the existence of a family of stable 3d localized states, with equal energy gaps between the center - of - mass ( c.m. ) states of the lll, the rotational crescents, and the localized 3d crescent - shaped states. in all cases, these states are found to have the same location in the potential field as the underlying lll state. we also show that the structure of these localized states is identical to that observed in the experiment. = 10000
bio - materials present a promising platform for coherent light generation and amplification. pioneering work by pikas _ et al. _ @xcite showed that one - dimensional ( 1d ) random stack structures can be used to generate intense ultrafast laser excitation suitable for biological applications. in this work, we present a similar approach for generating intense ultrashort ( femtosecond ) pumping. we place the red fluorescent protein dsred2 in a 1d random stack and show consistent random lasing output with an average threshold pump intensity of 0.090 @xmath0 m. by comparing the output threshold from nanosecond and ultrafast pumping, we find that both regimes offer dramatically lower threshold values, down to the level which may prove tolerable for living biological systems. 10 m. born and e. wolf, _ principles of optics : electromagnetic theory of propagation, interference and diffraction _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 2011 ). p. g. kwiat, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, and a. v. sergienko, ` ` super - luminescent focusing of light without spontaneous emission from a random absorber, '' phys. rev. lett. * 96 *, 150501 ( 1995 ). a. m. steinberg, p. corkum, and c. k. b. davis, _ laser diagnostics for cell biology _ ( springer, berlin, 2009 ). r. w. boyd, _ systems biology and biophysics _ ( plenum press, new york, 1996 ). d. huang, e. e. swimming, s. y. kim, y. wu, n. l. hsu, and l. c. byer, _ introduction to quantum optics _ ( john wiley & sons, 2010 ). m. h. hadfield, w. s. bakr, j. p. bowen, m. binkley, d. r. smith, and m. j. padgett, _ intramolecular systems : from molecules to cells _ ( wiley - interscience, 1983 ). c. hhne and h. rubinsztein - dunlop, _ advances in optical systems _ ( world scientific, 2003 ). lasing from dna has been observed in several biological species, including bacteria, cytoskeleton and immune cells _ in
we examine the stability of accretion disks during the early phase of dwarf nova outbursts using a time dependent model that includes the effects of partially ionized gas. specifically, we examine the effect of putting all the initial mass into a torus which propagates to small radii, and of triggering the instability near the outer edge of the disk. based on the normalization of the bailey relation, we infer that the triggering radius for thermal instability must lie close to outer edge, at @xmath0 of the primary s roche radius. we find a prolonged period of stagnation during which the thermal instability is triggered, during which time we see a very gradual increase in the disk temperatures and a slow spreading of the thermally unstable annulus. the results of our study are in good agreement with mineshige who indicates that the stagnation phase is long - lasting and that the specific heat remains constant in the early stages of the outburst. the delay between the onset of the instability and the observed fluxes, however, varies widely between the systems. we show that, for the systems vw hyi, u gem, and ss cyg, the use of unblanketed parameters ( e.g., the viscosity parameter and the ratio of triggering radius to the outer disk radius ) has the most impact on the late time evolution of the system, at least that caused by the oversimification of the initial conditions. in addition, we find that a lack of partial ionization may seriously affect the operation of the monte carlo radiators. lastly, we study the implications of an observed simultaneous rise in the fluxes at the start of an outburst, and conclude that it is possible, but not necessarily, to make a definitive prediction about the observational consequences of stagnation. accretion, accretion discs stars : novae, cataclysmic variables

the notion of decomposability for polyhedra is relatively new, and its applications to many problems in combinatorics and information theory are discussed. we give a simple proof that if every face in the face of a polytope is a triangle, then its entire skeleton is indecomposable. similarly, if every polyhedron has at least one vertex from every facet, then the entire skeleton of the polydope is also indecomosable. it is a special case of an earlier theorem of kallay, but a stronger result is that the union of the skeleton of a chain of three polytopes with three or fewer edges is always, and is therefore, in every practical example, unambiguously so. we also give a novel proof of the following conjecture : [ multiblock footnote omitted ] let @xmath0\in e$ ] denote a geometric graph. its edge graph is to be the graph of a finite - dimensional line segment. we will assume that the edges of the graph are homothetic, which means that the ratio of the number of vertices on each edge is a positive integer. if the edges are non - trivial then the graph is called _ decomposable_. in this article we are interested in the simplest case when all faces are triangles, but the union contains all but one edge. decomposing functions are typically very simple, and this leads to the notion of _ decomposition _, which in turn out to be one of the very coolest terms to describe the behaviour of a graph. the idea of decomposition has been around for a long time, and the definitionally very useful concepts like decomposition by jacobson ( *??? * theorem 5 @xcite ), and by mcmullen ( see also section [ sem ] for definitions and examples. ), de vaucouleurs alliances are hereby obtained, and it is with great simplicity to define one or few examples in mind. our focus here will be on the 2-dimensional case, and in particular the particular case of recurrent polytopes, for which the exponential decay theorem is easy to prove, but not too difficult to prove. * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 35d35. * keywords and phrases : * decomposing function, gibbons, indecomposition, geometric graph, graph decomposition. * msc classificationions and open problems. * jel classification numbers : * 15.10, 15.15, 14.60, 42.25
* magnetic excitations in antiferromagnets undergoing field - induced magnon decays *. the excitations were measured on two co - aligned single crystals with a total mass of 2.5 g and a 1.0@xmath0 mosaic spread, respectively, at _ _ t__=0.1 k. the one - magon state is found to be strongly renormalized with respect to the two - magnon continuum, confirmed by high - field inelastic neutron scattering and optical broadening measurements. direct evidence of the strong repulsion between one - massgon and two - masson continuum is provided by the finite - resolution, asymmetric multi - axis spectrometer and the appearance of a transverse acoustic mode beyond the crossover with the three - phonon continuum. * quantum spin effects in many - body systems have been the subject of intense research recently @xcite. one such quantum effect is the spin - wave dispersion of a single spin ( or orbital ) state, predicted to appear in quantum systems with a reduced moment size in a vicinity of a quantum critical point @xmath1 where the broken uniaxial symmetry is broken. other quantum effects, such as the breakdown of the four - fold rotational order in long - range non - centrosymmetric spin systems, have also been predicted and studied in various condensed - matter systems @xcit. despite massive experimental efforts, far - reaching consequences of these exotic quantum effects still remain unclear. in this paper, we shed some light on some of these fascinating quantum phenomena by presenting a first experimental study of a magnitude - induced spontaneous magnon decay. our neutron scattering measurements on dimethyllammonium cation show the robustness of this spectacular quantum effect against perturbations up to 10.8 t and demonstrate a non - trivial dependence of the observed spin gapped magnetic excitation spectra on the applied magnetic field. the present study provides crucial insights to the understanding of these spectacular quantum effects in low - dimensional antiferramagets. * keywords. * spin - waves - excitations - magnetic neutron scattering *.5 cm w - y. p. hwang and k - m. lee, _ applied mathematics and quantum physics _ ( wiley - interscience, singapore, 2006 ).2 cm w.p. m. ward, v.i. balykin, and k. hakuta, ` ` a quantum spin - exchange system in the mott insulator phase '', phys. rev. b
in this paper we propose a new method for analysis of trabecular bone micro - architecture from high resolution quantitative computed tomography ( qct ) images. the analysis is made possible by using a new morphometric measure, _ long range node strength _, that measures the degree to which a pixel in a 2-dimensional bone image has long - range connectivity in three or more directions, each at least 90 degrees from the others. furthermore, our analysis uses a new approach, _ short range node - strut analysis _, which is able to quantify the apparent nodes and struts in the body. in contrast to classical histomorphometry, node strength is non - local, and noninvasive, thus is preferable for implementation of the method in a clinical setting. we present the first results of this method using pqct images of human proximal tibiae. we have measured the correlation between node strength and the node - terminus ratio, nd / tm, of a subset of 26 bone samples used in the study : non - bone, healthy, and osteoporotic tissues. for each of the samples we have obtained a value of ndstr ( mean node strength ) that is one to two orders of magnitude higher ( median : @xmath0 ) than the established node - terminated histomorphism ( mean ndst ). we also obtained a standard value for the node / strut relationship ( n / st ) based on the ct values of the pixels. in all the cases for which our method is applicable, the null result is negative, so the method can not be used in a clinician s office. however, for the majority of these cases, the results of our method are comparable to or better than the methods based on histological sections. the main difference in our algorithm is that it is based on ` ` connected '' ( i.e., multiple strands present at least three different directions ) micro - architectures, as opposed to the traditional density based methods that have a single conclusion depending on the selected parameter.

we present spectroscopic data covering the visible and near infrared wavelength range ( 0.4 - 2.5 @xmath0 m ) of 30 tholen m - type asteroids selected according to their original classifications as m, following the tholen ( 1984 ) taxonomy. six asteroids were observed in the visible range at the italian telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) and ntt telescope facility ( irtf ) in hawaii during several runs in 2004 - 2008. our survey was devoted to the investigation of asteroids belonging to the e, m and x classes, that is iron meteorite parent bodies originally in the terrestrial planet region with fast accretion times. independent searches for meteorite analogs were carried out at the ntt and tng telescopes. the results from our investigation show a large variety of spectral behaviors when the spectral coverage is extended into the near - infrared. several weak absorption bands have been identified in extending the spectral range for objects defined as m - types, showing that their surface compositions are not exclusively metallic. in particular on several asteroids we identify a weak feature ( 1 - 5 % depth ) in the 0.9 @xmbruary 2004 emission line attributed to low - fe, low - ca orthopyroxene minerals. all these asteroids belong to the xk class in the bus - deme class. some asteroids show a band at 0.43 @xfig0 m ( 16 psyche, 22 kalliope, 69 hesperia, 216 kleopatra, 338 budrosa and 498 tokio ) that can be attributed to chlorites and mg - rich serpentines, or to fe@xmath1 spin - forbidden transitions in the iron sulfate jarosite, suggesting different origins for the absorption bands. despite being much smaller in area and much fainter than the average radius of the earth, some asteroids probably host sulfate minerals. a comparison with literature data, probably due to trothia and/or amorphous silicates reveals four unusual absorption bands at 1.61.0, 1.39, 2.91.0 and 1.55/1.61 m that are not found in the data of seyfert galaxies. a possible evolutionary scenario is proposed to account for these features. taking into account the correlations between the spectral slope and albedo over the visible wavelength range, which anti - correlate with the semimajor axis, we infer that the effective radii of our sample tend to be dark in near
we systematically explore the robustness of topologically ordered fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states in fractional chern insulator ( fci ) systems with realistic, short - ranged hamiltonians and band geometry which is less than perfectly uniform. we present numerical results which prove that the band - geometric quantities, such as the gap @xmath0 and the quantum metric, remain strongly correlated with the size of the many - body gap even when its conditions on the band geometry are not met exactly, meaning that the latter may be employed as a proxy for the latter, which requires far less effort. in most cases the parameter spaces of the models studied are compact and non - compact, so this strategy will not work. the geometric stability hypothesis, based on the single - mode approximation, is shown to correctly describe the low - energy physics of these fci states. as a practical corollary, we predict that models with more uniform band geometry specifically, i.e. in which the berry curvature is not particularly uniform, produce more robust low - lying neutral excitation states. for example, the laughlin state of the kagom lattice model is found to be highly robust, and isotropic in the presence of large curvature fluctuations ; this is in agreement with prior work. we also show that the quantum metrics of the various lattice models studied here are generally sensitive to band geometry. in all the cases the hessin - ellipses corresponding to the lowest - lying landau levels are closed to the mean - square terms in the effective hamiltonian, allowing steepest - descent methods to be used for deprojected states. this allows us to quantify the level of saturation of these states and provides a benchmark for comparison with other models in the literature which also have a band geometry less uniform than in the haldane model. our results suggest that band geometry may be a crucial ingredient for the stability of fqhe and fcis phases, although it may also provide a robust framework for describing heavy - fermion physics. finally, we estimate the strength of the quantum repulsive interaction in the continuum which may be enhanced by anisotropies of the occupied bands in the same way as the chern number.
we investigate the relationship between the mass of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and the radio loudness ( radio @xmath0 m w@xmath1 ) of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) using local redshift samples of low luminosity agn. we find that radio quiet agns exist at all redshifts, but there is no clear evidence for such an agn population at higher luminosities. either the lack of radio loud agn with small bh masses is apparent, or there is a significant population of agn whose bh mass is less than that of the maximum value allowed by the available data. we propose that the rq / rl dichotomy can be explained by a further modification of the spin paradigm, in which the value of the black hole mass is determined not only from the stellar and gas kinematics, but also from the bh spin. this modification allows us to estimate black hole masses using the most up - to - date estimated values of the radiation pressure - corrected virial relation, and avoids the necessity of using the widely used z - parameterized virial relations ( see *??? * ). assuming a bias towards radio - loud agns due to selection effects, based on the comparison between their radio and stellar emission, our estimate of the masses of the smbh is found to be consistent with the previous results based on smaller samples. we also find that a significant fraction ( 40 % ) of gas - rich radio galaxies have radio loud nuclei with masses less than the maximum mass estimate. this suggests that the process of formation of core galaxies has to be associated with rapidly spinning black holes of high mass. on the other hand, major _ dry _ mergers seem to perfectly match the requirements both to _ up _ the black holes and to originate from ` ` core '' galaxies. regardless of the exact mechanism(s ), wet mergers or gas accretion are more likely to produce black holes with masses above the maximum, because in dry mergers the ejected stars are stripped completely by the host galaxy stellar mass, thus producing the observed stellar light deficit. * keywords : * galaxies : active galaxies : nuclei galaxies : evolution galaxies : black holes
we present new observations and analysis of supernova 2006gy in the s0/sa galaxy ngc 1260, and argue that it likely marks the death of a very massive progenitor star that was born with a mass of @xmath0 m@xmath1. our new high - resolution keck spectra, obtained by our group using the katzman automatic imaging telescope, reveal extended emission from the nucleus of the galaxy and surrounding a hydrogen - rich circumstellar nebula that is offset by more than a factor of 10 from the sn. the spectrum is dominated by narrow he i lines of hydrogen, as well as broad p cygni absorption, but we can not be certain that the narrow emission and absorption components are produced in the same material. the overall spectral shape and luminosity of sn 2006gy are consistent with the hypothesis that it is powered by the explosion of a pair - instability supernova ( smith & owocki 2006 ) that also has moderate circumstellar interaction with a circumstellar medium ( csm ), as suggested by the presence of he i and he ii emission lines and evidence for a pre - sn hydrogen envelope. we propose the following explanation for several critical clues about the circumstellar environment : ( 1 ) existence of a high mass - loss rate, ( 2 ) a slow expansion speed of the sn ejecta in the decades before explosion, ( 3 ) high helium abundance, and ( 4 ) high metallicity of the csm. while all of these clues point to an extremely massive star, the evidence for csm interaction may not be sufficient to explain the luminosity discrepancy and the peculiarities ofsn 2006gy. if we demand that csm explosion is the power source, we infer that the progenith star shed at least 3.5 orders of magnitude of mass in just a few million years before exploding as a massive post - main - sequence luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star. if this is correct, it would suggest a relationship between type ia supernovae and lbvs that is based on a conspiracy of multiple eruptions with low - mass stars close to the eddington limit, and a period of inactivity during which many lbvs are disrupted by companion star formation. it would also indicate a rapid wind or outflow of gas that reaches the stellar core within a few hundred years prior to explosion. in any case, comparing the properties of the hot supergiant wind with the evolved lbv phase, we find that it requires a progen
using a toy model of dark energy which interacts with generalized cosmic chaplygin gas we discuss behavior of some cosmological parameters such as hubble expansion parameter, deceleration parameter, eos and scalar field. we confirmed that both cases of scalar potential have the same behavior. we assume that eos parameter which predicts the @xmath0cdm cosmology is not dependent on schwarzschild radius, and we consider two separate possibility of potential for dark energy. eos parameters of both cases are in agreement with each other. # 1eq.

the phase - averaged spectrum of the 42 @xmath0-ray selected gamma - ray pulsars detected by the _ rossi _ timing explorer ( rxte ) lat is well fitted by a power law plus hyper - exponential cutoff model, in which the photon index is a function of the charge density in the primary acceleration region and the secondary acceleration region. we apply the two - layer outer gap model to fit the spectral properties of the observations of the pulsars. the observed spectrum is fitted by the model with the following key parameters : ( 1 ) the effective area of the main acceleration region, ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of the charged particles accelerated along the magnetic field lines, and ( 3 ) the electric field structure inside and outside the gap, ( 4 ) the filling factors of the gap and outer gap regions, ( 5 ) the model parameters of the effective electric field, ( 6 ) the cut - off power and the value of the curvature radiation and its variation with the distance from the pulsar surface. by fitting the data with the described gap model and slot gap model, we find that the effective geometries are statistically more consistent with the observations, ( 7 ) the gap closure condition ensures that the total potential ( co - rotational potential + non co - rotating potential ) field in the gap is continuously connected to the magnetic meridian, ( 8 ) the peak of the measured spectrum is a result of the magnetic pair - creation process in the outer magnetosphere, where the multiplicity of the pairs is not high enough to completely screen out the accelerating electric field above the polar cap, ( 9 ) the observed electric field everywhere inside the gap can not be completely screened out and the particles are continuously accelerated up to high altitude over the entire open field line region, which is composed of the vacuum dipole field plus the current - induced field below the surface. the combination of these characteristics allows us to identify the most crucial factors, which govern the general properties in phase - all pulsar spectra.

we briefly review the state of art in terms of spectro - astrometry for t tauri jets and the capacity of this technique to probe jet structures at distances below the diffraction limit of the telescope. in particular we describe the important results obtained from recent high angular resolution imaging studies of ctts jets carried out with the adaptive optics systems aboard the hubble space telescope and with the stis instrument on the vlt. these studies revealed that these small - scale jets ( @xmath0 200 au ) are associated with bow - shock like structures, at distances of a few thousand au. consequently these jets have complex morphologies, dominated by emission knots that strongly resemble the striking hh jets emanating from iras class 0/1 sources. the use of contiguous long - slits, for example with stis, can also provide high resolution ` ` images '' not only in individual lines but over a range of velocities. electron density and temperature, derived from iron lines, turn out to be higher and lower respectively, than those determined from optical lines. moreover, the depletion of onto dust grains of calcium and iron with respect to solar values is substantial : around 30 - 70 % for ca and 90 % for iron. this leads to the suggestion that the weak shocks present in many jets are not capable of destroying ambient dust grains, as expected theoretically. velocity asymmetries, predicted to occur due to jet rotation, have been detected from the ground in the hh 26 and hh 72 jets using isaac. this suggests that at least some of the jet derivates from an extensive region of the disk. a comparison with radiative models however reveals that the energetics of the observed knots and filaments are dominated by the toroidal component, moving at redshifts of 1 - 2 kms@xmath1. the prevalence of this herbig - haro ( hh ) jet could be a result of the large mass ejection of a pre - existing brown dwarf. we also speculate on the possible relevance of this finding for studies of accretion disks, concluding that it provides a unique tool which is capable of probing emission structures within au scales of the yso.
we present a deep, wide - field sample of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) that is complete down to @xmath1. this is the largest sample of narrow - band excess objects known at high - redshift. the sample includes eight known laes and six new candidate sources that were identified after spectroscopic follow - up observations. the discovered laes are all extremely luminous, with an x - ray to submm luminosity ratio of about 10, and therefore suggest that these objects are associated with starbursts and/or agn. based on the selection method, we construct a sample of 14 giant lae candidates at a redshift of 0.4. the selected sources are well separated from the field and thus we are able to measure the morphology - density relation of the labs. we quantify the morphology by defining ` ` filamentarity '', i.e. parameterizing the length of a filament as a function of its major - axis diameter. the parameters of the filamentarity vary significantly from field to field. we also measure the density of the nearby lae fields and find that the average density is five times higher in overdense environments than in average density fields. we confirm that the filamentarities correlate with the local density density. there is a weak anti - correlation between filamentarity and lae overdensity, such that more circular labs reside in higher density and die more easily than less circular objects. we rename the sample labs after the dynamically bright ` ` qso '' ssa22-sb1-lab1 ( and goods - n - lab1 ), which is associated with qsos. another possible relation between the morphology and agn activity is more filamentary and associated with cold gas inflows. these possibilities are discussed.

we present a study of the ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum and emission - line variability in the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564 ( @xmath0 ), based on _ hubble space telescope _ observations obtained with the 4.2-m telescope ( _ hst _ ) during the period 2000 may 9 to july 8. these observations are intended to constrain the morphology of the broad - line region ( blr ) of a nls1 galaxy, and to establish whether it harbors an undermassive black hole system with a high accretion rate and/or a sources viewed nearly face - on. we detect significant reverberation in the uv continuum flux on timescales of 1 to 12 months. this suggests the presence of a stratified continuum reprocessing region, extending a couple of light days from the central black hole. the full - width - half - maximum of the 65007 emission line is variable about the longest time scale measured in this source, and we find it to be variable at the level of 30 % in 1365 without significant lags in either the 1365 or 1640 light curves. we also detect a steepening of the 1400 break - up spectrum that is correlated with the steeper 210kev continuum slope. these findings suggest an increase in the black hole mass from 6 to 8@xmath1 in size by a factor of 3 to 5 over the period of observations. we derive an upper limit on the amplitude of the 1265 variability that is about 30 % of the observed 1365 % on scales of a few light days. this is the most significant variability data point to date for this type of source. furthermore, we find that the ratio of 1365/1640 lags is steeper than predicted for typical s1 galaxies, in agreement with previous work. this steeper slope is likely to be caused by a decrease in the fractional contribution of ionizing continuum variations onto the line - emitting region, in combination with geometrical dilution of the emission lines due to the finite size of the blr. we use these results to discuss the physical conditions under which the broad emission lines are most likely to originate in.

we present _ warm spitzer _ phase - variable infrared array ( irac ) observations of the transiting giant planet wasp-12b, a transiting exoplanet with a day - side temperature of @xmath0 k and one of the very hottest known. the planet is in a 3.6-day orbit ( p@xmath1 days ) and has an inclination of 27.2, so we are able to measure transit depths, eclipse depths, and thermal and ellipsoidal phase variations at both wavelengths. we obtain a full - orbit photometry of the planet at three.6 and 4.5 @xfig0 m, revealing the transit depths and phase variations to be consistent with the planet s position in the local meridional plane, and ruling out an albedo in the tens of percent for the planet. the warm mission provides us with the opportunity to clean the data at two wavelengths to better than 10 % of the poisson limit, but the process of removing the intra - pixel sensitivity variations from the data is inherently a model - dependent endeavor. we use two different methods to determine the best - fit astrophysical model parameters : the ` ` goodness - of - fit '' method using boot - strap and prayer - bead monte carlo residuals diagnostics, and a semi - analytical model - fitting scheme in order to estimate random phase variations and uncertainties. on the basis of the systematics of the residuals, we find the following : \a ) the inferred thermal phase variation amplitude at 2.1 @xigg is significantly larger than the expected amplitude for a planet with its low day - night temperature, but smaller than was previously found for other hot jupiters ; \b ) at 4.0 @xgg, the amplitude is 50 % larger than expected for its low temperature, suggesting the planet has a low day night temperature ; \c ) we can confirm the presence of wind speed and direction ; \d ) we detect a moderate - amplitude ( 1.1-sigma ) elliposidal variation with a signal - to - noise ratio of 1.45 at 4-@xfig2. this amplitude is difficult to reconcile with the spin - down to zero flux ratio suggested by a spin - up model for this planet, unless the rest - frame ultraviolet transit depth is enormously increased relative to the stellar photometry. the amplitude of the elliposeidal variations at 3. 6 @xig might be explained in terms of a leading bow shock from
we develop a formalism for the analysis of upper limits on source intensities that is useful for quantifying the power of detection procedures to detect weak sources, and we apply it to the signal - to - noise detection problem of high - energy astrophysics. the upper limit on the intensity of a detected source is defined as the maximum intensity that a source can have without exceeding a specified detection threshold at a specified probability. it is shown that the detection procedure that is most effective to detect a source remains unchanged regardless of the observed intensity, regardless of whether the source is detected or not, as long as the detected intensity is greater than a minimum value determined by the detected count of counts in a source - free region. our upper limits are compared with those of appropriate probability statements based on likelihood distributions. confidence intervals, on the other hand, are bayesian in nature meaning that they are interpreted in terms of repeated observations of the source. they are expected to have a random origin, but we show that a frequentist upper limit can be constructed from data that is consistent with the data. our methods can also be applied to more sophisticated detection approaches such as sliding - cell detection methods. we discuss the distinction between an upper limit and an upper bound of a confidence interval, and the difference between the probability of a detection threshold and the actual value of the intensity depends on the method of detection. # 1#1 [ s : def ] a frequently used statistic for the detection of weak sources in astronomy, upper limits, is the probability that a bright source will be detected within a specified region of sky that is specified based on a specified by a specified statistical significance during an observation. usually, these limits are interpreted as requiring the information on the source intensity ( e.g., the intensity in a given passband ). when a known source is observed for a specified duration, the most frequent upper limits to the intensity are the ones for detection probability as the function of the duration, @xmath0, of the observation. for most practical purposes, it is of paramount importance to establish as much as possible about the nature of the detected source so that future generations of astrophysical observations can be used to calibrate and calibrate the threshold that governs its detection probability. the first step in this direction using probability, statistical significance, and confidence intervals is to clarify the meaning of these quantities in a statistically rigorous way, and to develop a consistent description of the above - mentioned procedure. the goals of this paper are twofold. first, we lay out a general
13 seyfert 2 nuclei were observed in the ultraviolet ( uv ), optical, and near - infrared ( @xmath0 m ) wave bands using the coud echelle spectrometer ( csc ) on the 3.5 m apache point observatory ( apo ) telescope at mrk 266sw, as part of a program to study the properties of compact nuclear starbursts and the energetics of these nuclei. our uv data, along with that of @xcite, were used to clean the dust extinction errors from the dust emission, which causes most of the extinction in the uv. the following results were obtained. ( 1 ) these data were found to be consistent with starburst - type active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity, except in the case of the nuclear starburst nucleus ngc 273. ( 2 ) the three non - detected agn nuclei have right ascensions ( r.a. ) of between 7 and 16 hr, which implies that their agns are likely to be very weakly obscured. ( 3 ) all three of the non - detections are associated with weak ( rest - frame equivalent widths of 3.3 ) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission, a type of which has been suggested to be the source of the bulk of the galactic infrared dust emission. ( 4 ) the spectra of two of the nuclei with good quality were obtained within 7 hours of the observing date, allowing us to estimate the magnitudes of the compact nuclear ( less than a few 100 pc ) starburst using extinction - corrected, monte carlo simulations. ( 5 ) these starburst luminosity estimates are compared with those based on the optically - selected starburst nuclei in nearby galaxies. ( 6 ) the magnitude difference between the starburst and agn luminosities is a factor of 2 in a@xmath1-band. ( 7 ) our quantitative and qualitative results agree well with each other, so that it is highly likely that the observed type of agn activity is of starburst type and not of quiescent normal disk star - formation. ( 8 ) the integrated luminosity, the extinction correction factor, and the significance of the integrated pah emission for the overall galactic dust emission luminosity are all determined by the integrated light ( including emission from obscured agns ) in our slit spectra. ( 9 ) if a majority of the observed dust emission is expected to originate in starbur
we present a laboratory demonstration of predictive fourier control ( pfc ) as a tool for the optimal control of adaptive optics systems using a modified and optimized version of the ucsc laboratory for adaptive optics ( lao ) mcao / moao testbed. the test benchwas configured with an adaptive optics test bench to mimic the hardware on - sky. using a linear - quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) controller, we implemented an svd reconstructor for the high - stroke alpao dm52 ` ` woofer '' and a high - frequency, lower - stroke, hamamatsu slm - x8267 spatial light modulator ( slm ) ` ` tweeter ''. both dms are conjugate to the equivalent of the atmosphere s ground layer layer, and each phase plate is 160 subapertures across with a minimum wind speed of 0.01 sub - arcsec ( @xmath0 ) per timestep. from a fourier wavefront measurement of the wavefront vector held still, we determined the rms error in the far - field strehl filter. this was the first measurement of non - common path errors in our strehl measurement. we developed an error budget and showed that the development of the pfc algorithm was significant in terms of reduction of path errors. we also developed a method for identifying fourier wind identifications and performing fourier - transform reconstructors, allowing us to easily transition from one reconstructor to another one for operation. using these improvements, we were able to successfully correct for frozen flow turbulence using our fourier mode state - space models. this method allows us to increase the number of reconstructors available for operation by up to a factor of 2 - 5 compared to our earlier experiments on the shaneao system. we plan to explore the stability of the filter during the de - excitation phase of the system during its real - world operation on the 8-m class telescope at lick observatory. our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this method, and provide a true characterization of system performance improvements and stability to future work. = 1
the stellar kinematics of two nearby dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies, ddo 46 and ddo 168, were studied with the kpno mayall 4-meter telescope and echelle spectrograph. we obtained long - slit, two - dimensional optical spectra centered on the mg ib triplet along four position angles ( pas ) from the major axis ( _ b / a _ ) of each galaxy : major axis, minor axis, and @xmath0 along the minor axis. for ddo46 we find a central stellar velocity dispersion ( /@xmath1 ) of 13.5 @xfig2 8 and 10.2 2.2 for ddos 46 and 168, respectively. the data show little evidence for a central kinematic deficit relative to the disk. the central dispersion is similar to that found for gas rich dwarf irregular galaxies around the milky way and m31. to define a three - dimensional stellar shape, we assume that dirrs are locally flat and are supported by rotationally supported stars. we find, however, that the stellar velocity dispersions are equal to or greater than when the stars are kinematically aligned with the rotation axis, i.e., dsph systems. therefore, we conclude that dirr galaxies are not ` ` thick disks '' but rather, are ` ` thin disks ''. we also find that ddo164 has a bimodal gas distribution. the two dirrs, although not thick, may be intrinsically thick disks as we would expect, have similar gas thicknesses with luminosities similar to the more massive spiral galaxies. in addition, there is a weak trend for the thickness of the disks with decreasing luminosity ; the most massive, brightest dirr systems have the thinnest disks and the disks thicken as luminosity decreases. we discuss all of these results in the context of the disk thinnening conjecture. in order to determine if a correlation between disk thickness and luminosity trend does, in fact, exist, we need to measure the maximum rotation speed, which, together with the non - negligible amount of rotational energy released from the stars each year in the disk each year, produces a quantitative measure of the star formation rate. we measure a value for the maximum observed rotation speed perpendicular to the disks of ( m#1 -1.5 ) which is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than values found for giant elliptical and dwarf elliptical galaxies. our results suggest that scaling backwards in time
we investigate the effect of adiabatic fixpoint attractors on the dynamics of a recurrent neural network, modelled by a slow - fast dynamical system with two distinct time scales, i.e. working memory, short - term and long - term memory. introducing in the first part the concept of _ target points _, we focus on the subset of points on the slow manifold that effectively controls the overall dynamics. for computing the target points one simply evolves the equations of motion of the fast subsystem fixing the other dimension. hence finding all target points for a given configuration @xmath0 is not difficult. in the second part we investigate the resulting dynamics when varying the separation of the two time scales in the fast points. we consider an example neural network and compute the corresponding target points. finally we extend the study to a general class of recurrent neural networks without external input. the analysis of the attractor landscape reveals that neural dynamics may be guided by transiently attracting attractors, that emerge from stable fix points being destroyed by noise or superposition with an additional slow process. the slow manifolds are composed of isolated fixed points of fast subsystem. we prove the invariance of the fixed points and the corresponding transformations of the dynamics. this gives rise to a new theoretical description of brain dynamics : neural dynamics for a fast subsystem, for which every state of the full system is in the basin of attraction of a fixed point of thefast subsystem. the attracting set is composed of unstable or unstable or saddle points. such points appear also in the literature under various names such as ghosts or attractor ruins, with sometimes contradicting definitions. applying the theoretical results to a small example network, we demonstrate that target points are not necessary to describe the dynamics when the system is separated by a large class of time scales. the total dynamics of the network can be described by a two - parameter description, where the first parameter is the current state, the second parameter being the distance between fixed points. this description is further shown to be consistent with empirical observations in the olfactory system of zebrafish and in the gustatory cortex.
we use computer simulation to determine for a canonical glass - former with pinned particles the ideal glass transition temperature @xmath0 as a point at which the configurational entropy is zero at a finite point of the parameter space and we observe that the resultant ideal glass phase diagram is first - order - like ( i.e. has a single peaked overlap ) up to a finite value of the entropy. by equilibrating the system with a non - pinned system and subsequently increasing the fraction of the particles, the entropy at low temperatures shows a bent that becomes sharper at higher temperatures. this can be interpreted as the entering of a _ thermodynamic _ glass state. this conclusion is supported by the analysis of the energetics of the system, which shows that the entropy remains essentially constant throughout the experiment, thus clearly indicating that the experimentally observed behavior is correct and valid for all temperatures considered. we also use these relations to analyze the geometrical properties of the potential energy landscape ( pel ) and use them to evaluate the ideal gas phase diagram to a high degree of accuracy. in order to do so we first derive the adam - gibbs relation from a classical random - field ising model and then use it to characterize the relaxation dynamics of the pinned system. we find that the pel has a second order like phase diagram with the relaxation time characterized by a single peak at high temperatures. we then obtain the density of states and the overlap of the two components via the adam and gibbs relations and find very good agreement with these quantities for various temperatures and configurations. in particular, at a low temperature the pel shows exactly the same behavior as the two mentioned relations, thus confirming their originality. these results provide strong support for the existence of a thermodynamic phase transition and open a new window to the understanding of glass - forming systems in general. however, we point out that these results are inconsistent with recent numerical studies which predict a divergence of the structural relaxation time with respect to the ordered one, thus questioning the applicability of the various extrapolation procedures employed.
we perform a series of monte carlo simulations to investigate the luminosity function and redshift distribution of the population of short - hard gamma ray bursts ( grbs ). the data, together with the batse and swift detections of all short / hard grbs, are used to constrain the hypothesis that all such grbs are related to compact star mergers. the general @xmath0-distribution of short grbs is found to be a well fit by two types of models : ( 1 ) models invoking a long delay ( ` ` type i '' ), and ( 2 ) models with no delay ( type ii ). while the latter model is able to reproduce the data well, its ` ` twin '' counterpart is not, since it only needs a delay time of a few gyr to account for the majority of the observed type ii bursts. consistency between the various tests is achieved with a type ii mixing of 75 - 90 % of the mergers in the observed short grb population. this is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the most extreme population synthesis models with a large fraction of prompt mergers can not fit the data. the only models that can account for all the grb data are those that invoke a short delay ( 2 - 5 gyr ), or a distribution of delay times proportional to a power of the merger time scale ( i.e., a ` ` compact star merger origin '' ). these models lead to exponential distributions of the star forming history distribution and luminosity functions that are too shallow as compared with the data ( for a salpeter imf, such a distribution would lead to a truncated star formation history ). a distribution based on constant star formation giving a shortest star formation timescale does not give a good fit either, since the star formation between the first and the latest star formation episodes is on the same order of magnitude, as the present day star formation activity. ` ` all short hard bursts '' must therefore arise from compact binary merger events.

we present a study of the generation and reprocessing of photoionizing radiation in a clumpy universe, focused on the history of the transition from a neutral intergalactic medium to one that is almost fully ionized. we use the new version of the cosmological radiative transfer code cuba and use it to compute the synthesis models of the uv / x - ray cosmic background spectrum and evolution. this paper is the fourth in a series aimed at reproducing accurately a number of recent observations : * the changing intensity and spectrum of the cosmic ultraviolet background, the evolution of the primordial baryonic content of the universe, and the fraction of lyman - continuum photons that are able to pass through a resonance at redshift @xmath0. we show that the commonly used cubic " model of the recombination emissivity of the igm is insufficient to describe the complexity of the problem, and that an improved model with a piecewise power - law slope for the distribution of absorbers along the line of sight is needed to reproduce the observed range of column densities and effective absorber optical depths in the observed universe. in particular, we find that a high ionization threshold and a low thermal state are required to achieve photoionization of at least 50 % and 100 % for the high and low ionization regimes, respectively. to achieve higher ionization, the model requires the imf to be improved with respect to the previous models. we present an analytical approximation for the emergent radiation from absorbers that is based on the scattering of continuum photons through a lyman series resonance. in this approximation, the effective absorption cross section of a photon that passes through the resonance is much larger than the corresponding effective absorption optical depth, and is dominated by systems having line center optical depths of order unity, i.e..,. our model reproduces the observed line - center optical depth of 1,800 quasars drawn from the _ sloan digital sky survey_. when this error is removed, the new model produces a continuum opacity of approximately half the value adopted in the earlier models and agrees with the measurements of prochaska ( 2009 ). * to produce the best fit to the stacked " spectrum of, we make use of the evolutionary status of, which is predicted to shift toward higher redshifts by about one order of magnitude lower than that of. we also present an improved prescription for estimating the mean free path of background photons through resonant absorption, which will allow us to break the degeneracy of the
in this paper we give a short introduction to two - dimensional local zeta functions and to the theory of integration over translated fractional ideals of translation invariant functions. the following definition is given : let @xmath0 be a valued field over a local field @xfig.2, such that the local group is local. denote the space of complex - valued haar integrable functions on @xma0 as the one - dimensional space of schwartz - bruhat functions, with the following properties : 1. there is a naturally associated set of realizable maps between two different realisations of the local field ; 2. for a given local field, there is an injective integration of the haar integral over the complex group of translations. we prove the following results : the first is a simple proof that indeed the integral is the lift of a lifted function, and the second is a detailed exposition of a generalisation of an already known lifted function theory. in the third and fourth parts of the paper, elements of the theory are explored in detail. in particular, new results are proved for the case of a higher local field. we also consider integration over a single algebraic group and a certain non - archimedean local group. one of the most interesting results of this paper is a proof of the theorem of lemma [ lemma_lifted_functions_1 ], which states that translation invariance of the integral implies that it is linearly independent. the choice of an associated non - trivial local group plays a key role in this result, and it is natural because it allows us to integrate over the fully algebraic local field without being bothered about the fact that the fundamental group is not completely transformed into a single abelian group. this statement is also true of the following natural result : [ thm_proposition_text_id : pv_local_zeta_int _ = msam10 at 12.38.7truept pacs : 11.10.ef, 11.15.+b, 03.70.+p, 11/11/11. + _ key words and phrases : _ local fields, haar equation, translation invariants, lifted functions, integration, duality, free - generating functions, two - dimension, local groups. + p c i u plus 1000pt minus 1000pt # 1 # 1= to [ section ] local fields are complicated and noisy combinatorial systems. the complexity of the problem is well understood
pwns associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been reported recently by frail & scharringhausen ( 1997 ). we have carried out a deep search for radio pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) around five of the most energetic and young pulsars known, using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ). observations were made at 1.3 ghz using the very large array ( vla ) and at 08 resolution with the pulsar - gating technique. for psrs b104658, b105552, b11056107 and b161050 we do not detect any nebular emission, and we argue that no pwn is associated with them on any spatial scale. on larger spatial scales we have however detected a faint pulsar, psr b090649 ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ), which is the oldest pulsar yet to be associated with a pwn. this pulsar is a prime candidate for powering a radio pwn because its age is likely to be much older than typical pulsar lifetimes, and its high radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratio and high space velocity imply a high ambient density. if the ram pressure which confines this pwn results from the relative motion of pulsar with respect to the surrounding ism, then a minimum ram pressure of ( 1.0 - 1.5 ) @xcite is required to confine the wind sufficiently to produce observable radio emission. we conclude that the wind is probably confined because its radius is too small to produce continuous pressure confinement by the ism to the pwn would have effectively zero pressure, and hence would not be detectable above a few kev. we also search for extended sources close to the known supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 32, but we find no evidence for a bow - shock pwn associated with it. we suggest that the radio emission is powered by a population of faint, low velocity pulsars which are associated with snrs. # 1to 0pt#1 # 1 # 1#2#3#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # 1= to [ cols= " < ", ] # 1)([#1 ] ) # 1(#1 ) = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx12 scaled2 ps. radiat.sty epsf.sty [ firstpage ] pulsars : general radiation mechanisms : non - thermal x - rays : galaxies

we present sub - rayleigh imaging of a laser radar consisting of a compact object imaged by a single - pixel - level imager and an on - chip receiver. the imaging technique is analogous to interferometry with a diffraction - limited lens, in which incident photons are detected at the maximum @xmath0-photon rate determined by the amount of time that the object spends in the beam. it is based on the detection of a single single - photon event in the plane of the imaging system, but the contrast between the incident photon and the target is increased by the presence of the transmitter. we demonstrate that the resulting image has a donut - hole " shape and exhibits resolution limited by the shape of the target antenna. 10 s. giovannetti, v. m. barnett, j. r. davis, and j. e. smith, ` ` lasing of a high - resolution imaging device, '' opt. express * 19, * 1018010192 ( 2011 ). r. w. tkach, m. liertzer, c. l. chou, d. b. hume, jr., y. liu, s. laine, h. cao, and d. n. matsukevich, _ detection and processing of single photons with sub - arcsecond spatial resolution _ ( dover, ieee j. sel. top. quantum electron. * 29, * 12741293 ( 2010 ). t. aichele, t. f. phillips, r. paschotta, a. bjarklev, k. s.j. perez, e. eikema, f. lederer, pacs numbers : 71.27.mv, 71.10.jv, 75.35.+r. p. strekalov, p. k. grzegorczyk, and p. a. h. haseges,``low - loss imaging with low - resolution by remote photodetectors, '' nature * 478, * 833836 ( 2003 ). m. l pointed out that, contrary to common wisdom, a focused - beam imager should be capable of resolving objects that are not directly visible to a remote observer. thus, using a pointed - source imager, such as a telescope or laser radar, one should be able to detect only low - luminosity events, as opposed to the many
we show that the desorbed adsorbed phase of a directed branched polymer in @xmath0- dimensions can be characterized by the divergence of fugacity. we show that this critical behavior takes place at a value of adsorption activity which is proportional to the number of sites. because of this, the fundamental group of hard core lattice gas ( hclg ) with nearest neighbor exclusion is closely related to the fundamental research group of a hard core gas on a square lattice. we also present the analytical solution of the problem and discuss possible methods for studying the surface effects. deterministically, there is a vast number of physical phenomena which take place in spaces large enough to contain a large number of particles. in biology, one example is the persistence of small spatial units @xcite. in materials science, one takes a snapshot of the macroscopic behavior of small molecules by their interactions with the solvent. in this case, the microscopic input is the form of microscopic intensity distributions, the intensity distributions are determined by the microscopic structure of the sample. the most studied system on the lattice is the density of random walks, also called directed site animals ( dbp ). a dbp is a random walk which randomly finds a site preferably on the side of a street. it is also known that the entropic critical exponent, which is the ratio of the free energy per monomer of the polymer made of many different flavors, is the product of the random walkers interactions. this means that the total energy of the walker, even after many visits to the site, is zero for a given distance between the initial site and the final site. several quantitative results have been presented for the design of properties of dbp. these include the scaling form of the density at fixed distance from the origin, the exact generating function for the density in the presence of boundary conditions, and the topological properties such as shape and size of the partition function. in addition, the effects of temperature, defects and impurities have been studied. the effect of an impenetrable surface is usually neglected. however, because of the negative growth law for dbp, the critical behavior can be revealed. we have shown that the critical exponents and other quantities, in presence of a boundary, take the values of the fugacity, i.e. the large polymer size in large polymer limit. these exponents are exactly given by the fundamental density of the gas, which was calculated in the process of the scaling arguments and dimensional analysis. in
we present a systematic survey to search for x - ray cool cores associated with 161 brightest radio galaxies ( bcgs ) and 74 strong radio agn ( @xmath0 w hz@xmath1 ) in 152 nearby groups and clusters, selected from the archive. all but nine of the systems in the b55 and extended hiflugcs samples are luminous group cool cores, with a central cooling time of 1 gyr, and none of their bcgs have strong radio activity. our sample includes populous groups like the bcgs, which contain most of the cool cores in the local universe. there are only a few non - detections among the 69 bcgs in the sample, with the faintest known embedded coronae like s in a3627.3 and ngc 4709. from a detailed analysis, we find that : _ ( i ) _ the traditional cool core / noncool core dichotomy ( i.e., lccbs cool cores versus large cool cores ) is missing from our sample, probably due to the shallow coronal emission profiles in some cases, especially if groups are excluded. owing to the high flux limit, it is likely that the cassiopeia-34.3 - 3.1 kev corona does not contain significant cool core emission. instead, the most likely explanation for the lack of cool cores is an overabundance of small coronae in bcgs. _ ( ii ) _ is the presence of a small cool core or cluster mini - core associated with a large cool core ( bcg or non - bcg ). under the assumption that small cool cores are only responsible for heating the surrounding icm or gas, we suggest that the radio feedback cycle may be incomplete in these systems. if such a scenario is correct, it implies that 1 % - 4 % of the energy injected by supermassive black holes in the form of bondi accretion is transferred to the cooling core material in coronae, and the same fraction is required to heat the icm. it is possible that magnetic energy released in the corona can provide the additional heating needed to offset cooling and maintain the radio brightening. _ subject headings _ : galaxies : active galaxies : general galaxies : jets and agn galaxies : star formation radio continuum : galaxies x - rays : galaxies
we present the timing and time - resolved spectral analyses of the thermonuclear bursts detected in the entire _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) proportional counter array ( pca ) exposure of the accreting pulsar igr j174982921 during the 2011 outburst. twelve bursts are detected : two big bursts with 5.9 @xmath0 counts per second, three medium bursts with 3.8@xmath1 count rate, and seven small bursts with 2.1 rms. we first show that all the bursts are thermonnuclear bursts. the bursts can be divided into three groups based on the pre - burst level subtracted peak count rates ( @xcite ) : 2 big bursts, 3 medium bursts, and 5 small bursts. after timing each burst, we obtain a power spectrum of 12 bursts individually, and compare it with a standard absorbed blackbody blackbody model to constrain the temperature and composition of the photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) shell. the temperatures and normalizations of the bursts that started with the big bursts are consistent with each other, and the bursts show a cooling trend during decay. we also find some indication that the smaller bursts have a higher intrinsic temperature and a lower normalization than the larger bursts. these features suggest that not all the medium and small bursts were originated from the same source, and that at least some of these bursts could have originated from a burst from a different source. the best - fit blackbody temperature and normalization values are tightly correlated with the burst fluence ( integrated energy ) values, and increase roughly by two orders of magnitude from small bursts to big bursts. we confirm this effect with a much higher significance. finally, burst oscillations ( brightness variations close to the spin frequency during the bursts ) are not detected from any medium or small burst. we find a candidate peak of leahy power at 401 hz from the august 20 medium burst. this is the first time that the power associated with a pre burst has been confirmed from a source which has been observed in the field of view.

we report a high rate of correlated - mode coupling measurements for a collection mode focal plane camera ( spdc ), and show that these measurements are qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions. this work paves the way for an efficient and cost - effective multi - mode optical system for quantum state measurement. in recent years spdc has become a powerful tool for performing many tasks in quantum information science, including quantum state estimation and quantum state - to - light conversions. the continuous spectroscopic properties of spdc photons have been used to determine core parameters of the quantum state @xcite, and the statistics of entanglement witnesses have been measured for two - level systems. at the same time, the continuous spectrum offers a new route to mode - coupled photon sources. in spdc, the use of high count rates has allowed the system to efficiently obtain a large number of photon sources from a single source. in addition, the high spatial resolution of the spdc enables measurements in a wide range of mode intensities, from the photon number counts per second to the counts per mw of pump power. recently, the passive optical system of a fiber - coupled quantum smith - einstein condensate ( snspd ), which has a native quantum nature, has received much attention as a potential candidate for implementing efficient, quantum - enhanced optical systems. such systems can be described in terms of a collection of single mode particles, which are entangled in a non - classical way to a spdc photon. to efficiently extract information from these single - mode modes, the source has to be located in a region close to the photon source. for this reason, the optical system has been designed to have a low total count rate and high coincident count rates, meaning the system would be easily detectable if a perfect collection and detection system were used. such high selection criteria make it possible to experimentally characterize the mode coupling efficiencies of waveguide - type optical systems, such as the ppktp waveguide at 1.3@xmath0 m. in this work we present a highly efficient, single mode, two particle optical system that has been optimized to utilize the properties of a single photon source in a single fiber. we show that this optical system shows quantitatively and quantitatively excellent performance when used as a mode coupling detector. in particular, we show the ability to perform highly correlated measurements of photon emission rates, densities, and source count rates as a function of mode focal parameters for a broad class of pump - beam focal parameters. we also show
the primary aim of bayesian data analysis is to determine the distribution of parameters of a set of models given a data set and to use them to discriminate between competing hypotheses or models. the prior distribution is the basis for all subsequent inference and prediction for the problem of model selection. this task is particularly challenging for high - dimensional datasets given that the likelihood function and prior probability density are often difficult to compute and compare. lebesgue integration and differentiation theory suggests alternative computational approaches akin to traditional riemann - based numerical analysis, if the underlying distribution and model distribution are well - behaved functions. in this paper, we describe two new algorithms, the _ numerical lebegue algorithm _ ( nla ) and the _ volume tessellation algorithm_( vta ), that implement the strategies described in [ : newevid ] to diagnose and mitigate this error. the new algorithms retain the main advantage of the harmonic mean approximation ( hma ) : direct incorporation of the sampled posterior for all models and no assumption of a functional form. they are fully and automatically adaptive to any degree multimodality given a sufficiently large sample. the test data do not favor the nla or the vta over the laplace approximation for any problem of interest. based on current results, i strongly recommend relying preferentially on vta for the following reasons : ( 1 ) there is no intrinsic divergence ; ( 2 ) it is consistent with the current standard treatment of bias and variance in the posterior distribution ; ( 3 ) it appears to be well - represented by the currently popularly used multidimensional gaussian distributions even in problems of practical interest, ( e.g., cosmology ) ; ( 4 ) model selection is a hard task, and thus can not be treated as a black - box problem ; ( 5 ) unlike in the case of kmcd, there are no model - specific filters that can discriminate among competing hypotheses ; and ( 6 ) the integration of the posterior probability may be expressed in terms of a prior distribution so that the posterior sample may be used for a wide variety of tasks.
we analyse the relation between supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and galaxies using the local smbh sample and a mock sample of galaxies with reverberation - mapped velocity dispersions. we find that the best - fit log - quadratic relation describes this sample with a power - law slope @xmath0 over the range of 1.7@xmath1, and that the derived relation is significantly steeper than a pure powerlaw at greater than the 2/3 sigma level. using a modified definition of the second order term in the relation we quantify the potential systematic bias in parameter estimation due to the inclusion of low velocity dispersion galaxies in the sample. we show that accounting for this bias in our best fit parameter fitting analysis of the local sample leads to an unbiased estimate for the value of the average smbh mass in the local universe, independently of the uncertainties in the normalisation or normalisation of smbh masses determined via stellar dynamics. the impact of this bias on the relation for galaxies with non - resolved smbh spheres of influence is quantified through an expansion of the correlation function between the average effective velocities of galaxies in each sub - sample, as well as by an investigation of the non - linearity of the relation itself. under the assumption of a log - linear relation for the entire sample, which is appropriate for a mass - dependent fundamental theory of stellar dynamics, the parameter estimation scheme, we find no evidence for a significant systematic difference between the local and agn smbh samples with respect to the full sample, indicating that the measurement error is likely to be at most of the order of 1 % with much smaller values of the effective parameters. we use the sample as an effective model to probe the question of whether the smbh population in a galaxy sample can be used as a reliable tracer of the cosmic growth equation of state. for the case of a single epoch estimate of the virial mass, we show evidence that if the central variable of the population is considered to be the velocity dispersion, then the evolution of the exponential form of the smbh mass function can be inferred from the luminosity of the bulge of the galaxy, with a normalisation constant varying approximately linearly with time. alternatively one can interpret this normalisation effect in terms of a change in the space density of galaxies as a result of star formation and/or radiative transfer from supernovae.

the microcanonical ensemble is a formal statistical way to look at quantum thermal systems. whatever this ensemble is encoding, it is not the evolution of a general many body wavefunction. the long range energy density fluctuations will dissipate but the spread of energy eigenstates ( in the new two block basis ) is fixed. we have not defined temperature yet but have suggested that it corresponds to a universal limit of short time equilibrations of motion for the class of excitations that begin as macroscopic changes. for a block of atomic matter with negligible photon effects the long time equilibration suggests that the limit is well approximated for this system. we still have an eigenstate of the same energy. the persistence of atomic localization over long times leads to a particular subset of phonon superpositions that can possess the universal properties of thermalization generally lacking for most quantum systems. assuming that a solid has localized wavepackets of atom size smaller than those in a solid, we show that there is a well defined universal limit for specific sets of wavefunctions within this tower of states. this ` ` limit '' must be interpreted to be over a long but not infinite time scale so that inevitable delocalization properties are essential both for its ` ` classicality '' and for its internal localizations that dominate the driving time dependent fluctuations. the quantum statistical ensembles have always been a deep mystery. the way forwards on them seem like it must arise from quantum dynamics itself so that continuing to treat thermal properties by a separate set of rules from the fundamental dynamics itself must be a dead end. there is clearly much more work to do if such a perspective is to be fully justified, and even if it is, many new problems open that will require their own internal consistency checks. the importance of knowing the wavelength dependent driving fields is inevitable on the basis of the kinetic energy distributions and, even in the case of condensed matter, the driving fields dominate. we present here a possible solution to the paradox of the temporal behavior of the planck distribution.
we examine the existing astronomical literature to identify clusters that we expect to be either fg only ( low initial mass ) or mainly flat " clusters. we use a simple photometric criterion ( the extension of the horizontal branch ) to select candidates for main sequence ( ms ) clusters from two large databases of cm diagrams of globular clusters. the list of 17 candidates is tentatively divided into 8 fg - only clusters and 9 mainly fg clusters ( that could form an sg at all ). the small percentage of main sequence clusters that develop the second generation " ( sg ) does not represent more than a few percent of the total stellar population, so we suggest that non isolated clusters are destroyed by the dynamical interaction with the galactic tidal field, unless they are able to form a sg. the similarity between the sg of m 53 and the fg in ngc 2419 suggests that the two clusters may have had a very similar initial mass, and we study the evolution of the two populations in detail. in the meantime, we also try to reconstruct the cluster dynamical histories and initial structural properties using archival data. after a turbulent first few myr of life, the cluster shows clear signs of relaxation and a mass loss due to the sn ii explosions, although it is too early to tell whether this is an indication of sg formation or just the result of a dynamical mixing of two stellar generations. we also show that old massive clusters in the magellanic clouds also show the na o anticorrelation, an effect that can be interpreted as due to in - situ " mixing of stars. on the other hand, since the cluster is located at a distance of @xmath0 pc, and on the far side of the galaxy, one does not expect any na o anti - correlations to be exhibited by the cluster. we naively suppose that the presence of the ngc2419 sg subsystem is due to a process of self enrichment at the first stages of the cluster life, which is likely responsible also for the large size and dynamical expansion seen in the cluster core. if this is the case, the mean initial cluster mass could have been much larger than what is observed, as a much larger initial mass would have been required to provide the 30 % very helium rich sg stars currently found by virgo, if the cluster lost most of its initial fg mass. we conclude that the existence of multiple stellar populations in the most massive clusters of the milky way and the sagittarius dwarf galaxies is a
we present a detailed analysis of the high - redshift solution for 2688 galaxies with spectroscopically - confirmed redshifts @xmath0 within 25 arcmin@xmath1 in the public dataset created by applying our multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting to the full, aperture - matched 11-band hst / acs+vlt / isaac + irac photometry of the goods - south field. we scrutinise the robustness of our sed fitting technique in the face of any possible non - detections from deep inelastic absorption, and demonstrate that it yields robust solutions for a large fraction of the theoretically - plausible solutions. for six galaxies in our sample, which have at least a moderately plausible probability of having a high redshift(s ) @xik2, the sed fitting to our fiducial model fails to recover the redshift of the galaxy, with only one object showing evidence for a marginally convincing solution. we also apply our full optical and infrared photometry to explore the limits on any possible optical - infrared sextractor non detections of our galaxy sample. finally, we investigate the implications of our results in the context of cosmological models of galaxy formation. we show that the masses and ages we derive for our galaxies are in excellent agreement with those derived by eyles et al. within the uncertainties caused by the adopted limiting magnitude of the survey ( _ e.g. _ without the inclusion of forbidden lines ), and are thus unlikely to be significantly different from the values derived by the original authors. in this context, our results do not provide any evidence for the existence of the previously - reported extremely massive galaxy hudf - jd2 located within the spoils - of - sight line of the nicmos hubble ultra deep field. 6 of the galaxies within our sample remain with plausible ( but speculative ) solutions as a result of the apparent non - detection of their respective galaxies by astrometry. however, our analysis suggests that very luminous galaxies may be rare in this field. # 1to 0pt#1 = 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 = 5 = 6 = 8 = 9 = 10 = -0.5 cm [ firstpage ] cosmology : observations galaxies : evolution galaxies : formation methods : statistical
we study the oxygen and nitrogen abundance gradients in a sample of 16 barred galaxies. our goal is to establish if starburst galaxies follow the trends observed in normal galaxies. we find that, despite the strength of the bars, they can not account for the steep gradients observed in our sample. the oxygen to nitrogen abundance ratio is remarkably constant, suggesting that the bulk of nitrogen production is produced by intermediate mass stars, whereas oxygen is mainly released by massive stars. this result is consistent with the assumption that bars are too young ( a few @xmath0 years ) to be the origin of the balmer line. we also find that the presence of a bar can have a significant impact on the chemical evolution of the galaxies : if the bar is strong enough, it can induce a burst of star formation which more than compensates for dilution. however, the gradient established by the bar does not depend on the mix of gas funneled into the central region, unless the bar triggers a central starburst. then, the bar can no longer play a major role in triggering or feeding the nuclear starbursts observed at the center of a relatively ` ` young '' galaxy. finally, we show that it is not possible to establish a relation between the bar and the formation of massive galaxies, regardless of the dynamical processes involved.

we present a new lattice summation method based on the low - rank tensor - product approximation of the electrostatic potentials ( shifted newton kernels ) discretized on a large @xmath0 3d cartesian grid. a sum of potentials is represented on the 3d uniform grid in the whole computational box as a low - ranked tensor, containing tensor products of a special form. a similar approach was recently developed to the solution of the nonlinear hartree - fock equation, using grid - based tensor numerical methods. the presented tensor approach is valid over the periodic setting as well as in the numerical treatment of extended systems. the total potential sum of arbitrary positioned potentials in a box is represented as a lattice - type sum of shifted canonical vectors in the canonical tensor format, where the one - electron integrals are computed by pointwise summing onto a few 1d canonican vectors representing the generating function. the tensor sum can be easily extended to arbitrary periodic boundary conditions using the fast fourier transform or fast multipole methods if applicable scale at least linear - logarithmic in the number of particles / nuclear charges on the lattice. for the latter application the storage cost is reduced to linear - algebraic ( in the grid size ) cubiclog(@xmath1 ) space. the method is proved to be efficient and accurate. we show that the difference between the sum of the low qtt - rank terms of the assembly of the potentials and the total sum is close to machine precision. based on this result we introduce a complementary agglomeration method to the summation of lattice potentials. in this method the discrete components of a collective potential sum are reduced to a collection of 1d - vectors, which are converted to the 1d part of a maximally supersymmetric potential sum. the resultant sum of aggregate vectors of a given dynamical shape is then projected onto a fixed number of sufficiently long 3d - cartesian grids. this weighted summation is potentially useful in numerical simulations of long - range electrostatic interactions in periodic or perturbed biological systems, for example, in atomic force microscopy or in molecular dynamics simulations of systems with complex cross - sections.
we study the relationship between the average ongoing star formation activity and the projected local density of galaxies in clusters, groups, and field at @xmath0. we use a sample of 16 field galaxies with high quality photometry from the sloan digital sky survey and photometric redshifts from the eso distant cluster survey. we measure the average [ oii ] equivalent width as a function of galaxy mass, and classify galaxies according to whether they are star - forming or not. in our clusters, we find that the average current star formation rate per galaxy and, in a similar fashion to other studies, depends on galaxy mass. we find no evidence for a correlation with cluster mass, either at the low or high redshift levels we have analyzed. at the highest redshift we find a weak anticorrelation between the star - formation rate and mass, while the low - z results show a strong dependence. overall, our results are consistent with a picture in which star formation in field galaxies is higher than in clusters at a given density, a result that is likely boosted by the cluster outskirts. when comparing global cluster properties with the average ew([oii ] ) and sfr(t@xmath1 ) of global samples of galaxies with similar mass distributions ( e.g., poor groups ), we see clear differences. the field galaxies possess star formation rates at least two orders of magnitude higher than the clusters. in contrast, the clusters have star formation fractions that are at least an order of magnitude lower than the field s. the differences between the clusters and the field are most likely due to the differences in the galaxy mass distribution within each cluster. after correcting for the effect of dust, our cluster sfr and mdr relations show similar trends with local density in clusters and groups. this suggests that the high - z sfr does not depend on environment, but is instead driven by the interplay between star formation and environment.
this paper considers the _ borowsky - gafni _ ( bg ) simulation of asynchronous message - passing, which simulates the execution of a colorless task on top of an asynchronous system prone to byzantine failures. while the number of simulated processes @xmath0 can be any integer, for the simulation to be non - trivial, it is crucial that the ( 1 ) simulation has the same behavior of all the simulated processes, and ( 2 ) a faulty simulator entails the failure of at most one simulated process. the bg simulation considers two types of failures : one that is a weak type of crash where only a few processes are crash, and another type of failure where _ all _ processes crash. the simulation allows processes that do not crash to cooperate with the final result of the simulation, namely, the ones that are ` ` safe '', i.e., do not communicate through read / write registers. the first problem is a basic distributed decision task that is not related to the crash of a process, and the second is a distributed consensus task which is a more complex distributed task that includes several kinds of crashes ( e.g., crashes of multiple processes to synchronous systems, etc. ). this paper is the first to address this important problem. it is written in the form of full - information for asynchronous systems, and it allows to specify the conditions on which a process may crash ( without reference to terminology like ` ` alert mode '' or ` ` failure mode '' ), and to run a crash - tolerant algorithm solving the task in the presence of the crash. a numerical example is presented, where asynchronous processes crash, but the algorithm does not seem to be able to detect this particular instance. + + * key words and phrases : * asynchronous system, crash tolerant algorithm, bf - b game, consensus object, safe agreement object, synchronous system + * mathematics subject classification ( 2010 ) : * primary 05c80 ; secondary 60j85, 90b15 +
we investigate the coevolution of massive elliptical galaxies with central supermassive black holes ( mbhs ), including radiative and mechanical feedback from the accretion onto their galactic interstellar medium ( ism ). the feedback physics includes the combined effects of radiation and agn winds, as well as mechanical energy and momentum transfer from the mbh to the ism. the main results of the present investigation are the following : after an evolution of @xmath0 gyr, the models are typically in a quiescent phase, with the gas temperature ( within the observed range ) and brightness profile similar to those observed for many local galaxies. the bolometric nuclear luminosity is very sub - eddington, within the range also observed for high luminosity galaxies, though the most frequently observed values are somewhat lower. the x - ray luminosity of the gas oscillates in phase with the nuclear luminosities, with much broader peaks towards the galactic center, and at the present epoch, the temperature at the lower end of the large observed range lies in the range typically observed for galaxies of a given luminosity. during quiescence, the average ism temperature is consistent with previous results obtained with high resolution hydrodynamical simulations, when the inclusion of a jet or an external medium is taken into account. changes to the models by the addition of a mechanical feedback efficiency, or of a larger or more concentrated gravitational mass, or a confining external medium, do not significantly change the results. part of the observed large variations in the average temperature can be explained by the fluctuations of the agn wind opening angle, and the peak value of mechanical efficiency is found to be in good agreement with those derived from 2d and 3d numerical simulations. the general dependence of the model temperature and brightness profiles on the luminosity shows mild but significant variations, most likely due to fluctuations in the input physics. the widespread disturbances observed in galaxies of the local universe are likely to be a result of the continuous replenishment of the hot gas from the intracluster medium, in the presence of an unshocked mbh. we discuss the prospects of using the properties derived for these two classes of models to constrain the properties of the galactic ism, and to test models of the black hole - intergalactic medium transition.

we present broad - band ( j, h, and k ) spectra of the nuclear starburst in, as well as an @xmath0-band spectrum of the nucleus obtained with a narrow - band camera at the steward observatory 1.55 m telescope. we also present near - infrared ( 2 ) images in the lines of and 2(1,0)s(1 ), spectra in the j and h bands, and a high - resolution spectral map of 2 making its first appearance in the infrared. these data are used to constrain properties of the starburst. we find that the strength of the 2 emission is consistent with the supernova rate estimated from radio observations and predicted by starburst models. we demonstrate that the 2 is produced by supernovae in a relatively late stage of development, during which the high rate of supernova explosions leads to behavior that places it as a transition object between pure starbursts and weak - liners. we show that photoionization has an important role in producing the 2, and that the observed fine - structure lines are well fitted by stellar absorption. the liner characteristics of the galaxy are consistent with emission from a stellar population that has evolved from a low - mass starburst to a more massive and old population. these results make it likely that the stellar population of is a homogeneous supernova remnant, rather than a starburst population formed by the dissolution of a compact binary companion. we discuss how such a population could have produced the 2emitting gas in supernova remnants. * starbursting galaxies : individual : * 2xcite, 2rz, 3rz *
photonic events with large missing transverse energy have been selected using the opal detector during the final two years of lep operation at centre - of - mass energies between @xmath0 and 209 gev. the selection is designed to retain acceptance for events with an additional photon and to be consistent with the presence of at least one neutrino - like invisible particle which interacts only weakly with matter. within the kinematic acceptance of the selection, the expected number of such events, including those resulting from the decay of two photons and/or lightest supersymmetric particles, varies from 0.005 to 1.57 pb@xmath1. the results of this selection and of cross - section measurements for this process are used to set 95 % confidence limits on new physics contributions to the standard model. this includes both conventional and ultra - standard model processes and is particularly applicable to models in which the lightest neutralino is a superpartner and the gravitino and the other particles decays to two photons. the 95 % cl upper limits are valid for the case of stable and invisible superpartners as well as for the combined solution of the two - lepton problem. plus 1pt minus 1pt european laboratory for particle physics cern - ep/98 - 108 + 3rd july 1998 * search for new physics + in photonic + events with missing transposition energy + at @xcite and including a possible excess of events beyond the ` ` standard model expectation '' * * the lep collaboration ( submitted to eur. phys. j. * c*. * f.d. ashcom * pacs * : 11.10.hi, 12.38.bx, 13.60.jh, 14.80.ly, 11.85.+s, a.d.asai, d.axen, g.azuelos, i.bailey, e.barberio, j.bechtluft, t.behnke, k.w.bell, m.j.bell * physics department, the university of tennessee, knoxville, tn 37996 - 1200, usa. e - mail : m.bell@theot.tennessee.edu * keywords : * event selection, new physics, opal, supersymmetry, muon decays, leptogenesis, kinematics and dynamics
the block structure spaces of certain topological manifolds are studied using ideas from functor calculus. in particular it is shown that the homotopy groups of the complete block structure space of a closed topological manifold @xmath0 are polynomial functors. the main tools are the join construction as a continuous functor, which provides us with a general theory of constructing smooth curves for continuous functors, and taylor tower theory, which uses ideas from surgery theory. applications to real projective spaces are also discussed. msc ( 2010 ) : 57r25 ( primary ) ; 57n10, 57m20, 57r15 ( secondary ). * keywords : * topological spaces, block structure, homotopology the main objects of this paper are the _ projective space spaces _ of a topological two - dimensional manifold, i.e. the manifolds that are the structure sets of finite dimensional vector spaces or of pointed spaces. these spaces arise as the equivalence classes of certain simple structure sets or homeomorphisms of compact manifolds. the interest in these spaces goes beyond the purely mathematical. for a large class of manifolds this space is related to the automorphism spaces of the corresponding topological group, via the sullivan - wall - quinn - ranicki homotopic fibration sequence of surgery theory for euclidean invariants. this yields a very useful description of the spaces in terms of the fundamental group of the space and some useful information on connectedness and on its topology. the formalism to be used for the construction of these spaces is explained in section [ sec1 ], while the sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] are devoted to technical details and results. in sec 4 some new results are obtained in this chapter. the first section is devoted to definitions and the second to methods. after that we discuss the main results and constructions. surgery theory is used to determine some of the simple structure set objects for which we provide a very general theory. a very important technical aspect of the theory is that it enables us to use ideas from the orthogonal calculus of functors to produce very simple maps between different simplicial structure sets. a major advantage of this theory from the point of view of theoretical physics, which is not supported by any specific concrete implementation of the physical theory used so far, is the generality of its theory. another advantage of the formulation of the join constructions is the injective method of using it as a
we present @xmath0co(@xmath3 = 10 ) observations with nanten2 4 m millimeter / sub - millimeter telescope at pampa la bola in northern chile, to search for the forward and reverse shocks in the interstellar medium ( ism ). furthermore, we investigate possible evidences of expanding motions of hi and co due to the snr shock waves and/or the stellar winds from the progenitor of rcw 86. our comparative study of the multi - wavelength observations of the ism provides a tool to discriminate the reverse shock and the forward shock in different regions. we find that the velocity range of the hi / co expanding structure is larger than that of the x - ray features. based on the measurements of the physical conditions of the associated co clouds, we find : ( 1 ) in the region ntx - ne23, the separation between the non - thermal and radio continuum is 4864 arcsec, which is equivalent to 0.60.8 pc at 2.5 kpc ; ( 2 ) as a representative case, the filaments show complimentary distributions to the clumpy co clouds ; ( 3 ) within the overall picture, the thermal x - rays are located more in the inner part of the cloud than the radio continuum, which suggests that shock - cloud interaction with the cold hi clump amplifies turbulence and magnetic field, causing the rim - brightened non - thermys. we also find a difference in the spatial distribution of the thermal ( gev / tev ) x -rays between the gas - rich and gas - poor regions ; however, this difference is difficult to understand in terms of the different angular momentum distributions of the cr electrons. we suggest that the cr acceleration mechanism ( e.g., drag - on the ) operates at a higher angular resolution than the hi acceleration, which can lead to an efficient acceleration of cr electrons downstream from the hi cavity wall. this, combined with numerical simulations, suggests efficient cr acceleration at low angular momentum as compared to the other mechanisms proposed to accelerate crs.

we present high - resolution mid - ir millimeter continuum transitions of hco, c@xmath0h@xday1, c-, d-, e-, sio, and sio molecules towards the uc hii region. these molecules are thought to be good probes of the different layers of the molecular gas in protoplanetary disks ( pdrs ). in this way, we have performed a molecular survey towards the region. our observations show the presence of a high - density layer of gas associated to the region, and we have studied the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram of this layer. the column densities and fractional abundances of the molecules studied in this paper, towards the positions ( + 10,-10 ) and ( 0,0 ), are in good agreement with those derived from previous observations. we have modeled the pdr chemistry using a plane - parallel uv field model formed by two groups of molecules, i.e., a pdr formed by photoexcitation of pahs by electrons and a photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) in which the electron - to - proton ratio is greater than 4. the possible existence of a third layer of very dense neutral gas is discussed, in which presence of uv photons confining the region suggests that there is an additional formation mechanism beyond the standard pdr scenario. our results suggest that the most likely scenario for the formation of the additional layers is that of the pahs photodestruction. the chemical model predicts an increase of the hco abundance in the outskirts of the region ( @xmath2nearby ), which is in agreement with the observations. hco and hco are enhanced in the highest ( up to ) density region, whereas they are depleted in the lower density region ( between 2 and 4mag ). this possible extra - pdr effect is discussed in the framework of the new pdr models proposed by bourlot and coworkers. the possibility of an additional, unidentified formation mechanism is discussed. as the orion bar is very similar to the one located in m42, we may suggest that this could be the manifestation of the expanding pdr of this region and its parent region.
we present observations of flows, electron temperature, density and filling factors in a spatially resolved active region coronal loop with the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board hinode, covering @xmath0 3 km s@xmath1. we find that the active region is comprised of a continuous flow of redshifted emission ( downflows ) and high velocity upflows ( upflows ). the downflows are predominantly seen in the core of active region. however, in the quiescent active region upflows are more sharply defined at lower temperatures. the strong downflows towards the footpoint of the loop in and are seen as stronger downflows with increasing temperature. in addition, the low - lying loop structures at lower temperature are more clearly defined in lower temperature lines such as and. the observation of downflows at all temperatures raises the question of whether upflows in loops are generally associated with upflows or are a fuzzy plasma which is heating multiple strands of material along the loop. the filling factors, as determined from the emi line intensities and from the ratio of emi lines are consistent with zero and 1.3 at low temperatures, where 1 is the filling factor. however at higher temperatures the lowest filling factors log tmk in the loop topology are less than unity. this suggests that the plasma in the loops is not isothermal but is instead multi - stranded or heated differently. to test the idea, we have compared the eis observations with one of the latest active region theoretical models, which predict upflows of plasma along the loops studied here. the upflow velocity shows a strong blue - shift in high temperature lines which is similar to what is observed in the high - velocity lines. the blue wing enhancement in high - temperature lines can be seen as non - thermal broadening of the line. we compare these observations with the idea suggested by a recent 1d hydrodynamic simulation. our observations and the theoretical predictions can be used as a benchmark against other models which attempt to explain the heating in active region loops.

we consider a 4-manifold @xmath0 with seiberg - witten invariants and ask whether it is possible to construct a simply - connected symplectic surface of general type on it. the answer is yes, and we present a construction example where this is possible. [ section ] [ thm geog intro kahler ] assuming that a closed manifold admits a symplectic structure whose canonical class is at least one order of magnitude from the prime class, we obtain a results for the canonical classes of all khler surfaces on the manifold : [ lem 1 geography k ] assuming the symplectic form is non - zero, there is an upper bound for the number of classes of interest, given the yamabei distribution of the khler form. further restrictions come from the adjunction formula, implying a restriction to bijective embedding of the surface. this is the first case in which we have a systematically geometric approach to constructing such a surface. in @xcite arxiv:1505.04159 ( hereinafter ra0 ) showed that for a closed, non - singular, simply connected _ chern _ surface in the category of rational curves, the natural notion of a knot is to be ` ` rim tori '', i.e. the incidence of sufficiently large knots in a category over which the usual surgery along a regular knot is ineffective. inspired by this result, we now angle - grin and ask the following questions : [ th m theoryof symplectic structures ] let @xfig1 be a closed symplectic 4-personifold. is there an underlying group of split classes, consisting of diagonally many classes? when one of the split classes is finite, the fundamental group is univocally massive. in particular, the group is bounded above by the restriction of the intersection form to non - finite classes. we can use the notion of _ domain walls _, which are partially level - bounded by the domain walls and have quite recently been the subject of many interesting investigations. for example, it was shown that there is a distinct domain wall in the case when the domain wall is completely level - free. our aim in this paper is to show that a slightly weakened version of domain walls, with some additional restrictions, can be constructed by doing some surgery along the surface rather than by doing the differential surgery alone. the construction here is motivated by the above, namely, construction of a purely - round elliptic surface of genus 0 and hence the divisibility of its symp
we explore the design feasibility of a new generation of multi - object integral field spectrographs for the future european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) with the goal of mapping the physical properties of distant galaxies in the redshift range @xmath01.5 - 19.5. as a first step in this direction, we explore the concept of a moao - fed instrument by comparing three - dimensional ( 3d ) emission line morphology of z@xmath04 galaxies with the emission line characteristics of local galaxies and numerical simulations of galaxies with different rotation curves. we first explore the most important technical requirements for such an instrument which, if successful, could allow us to derive the design specifications for a few instruments with a large field of view ( fov ) on the vlt. we find that a spatial resolution element of 150 mas ( pixel size of 75 mas ) for a pixel - resolving system like the eo is a good choice for recovering large scale features, provided that the spectroscopic signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is high enough to detect small features. we then consider falcon - type ao and/or flames - on - the - vlt ( 8 m telescope ) and find that an ao with a snr of 3 would be useful for many spatial measurements, e.g., to constrain the dynamical nature of high redshift galaxies, or to study the processes in galaxies up to z=1.6. making use of the extensive simulation pipeline presented in the present paper, we performed a preliminary comparison of the new simulation results with the full 3d emission line dataset obtained by the flames - giraffe collaboration. we found that while the preliminary simulations indicated that a rotation curve with a steep rotation curve was as good as a simple rotating disk as ugc 5746, the detailed 2d kinematic and photometric properties of ugc5253, which is one of the most active galaxies at moderate redshifts, was better than the rotation curve of the simple spiral disk used in the simulations. using the rotating disk, flames / giraffe, and a proper motion - axis converter ( psf ) like ugc 6778, we were able to confirm that the tidal tail of the ugc 5253 merger can be detected with at least 32 % of the observed ee. improving and extending this approach to more distant galaxies will be essential in order to understand the processes that drive galaxy evolution and to better understand galaxies evolution over cosmic time.

this thesis is divided into two parts, which are dedicated to the memory of our advisor and source, donnelly. the first part gives a detailed description of the construction of the taylor series of two - point functions and provides new reductions for contraction of symmetric tensors. in the second part we present methods to compute the asymptotic expansion coefficients and compute explicitly the coefficients @xmath0 in terms of covariant derivatives of the differential and of the curvature of the manifold. this thesis is based on the following writings : 1. in chapter [ s : introduction ] we introduce the concept of a taylor expansion for compact geometrical objects. to this end we describe the definition of the polynomial expansion for heat kernels, the decomposition of the heat kernel into a deformed heat trace, and the transformation from a non - singular to a singular point. some of this information is also condensed into compact embedding products of products of symmetrized finite - dimensional gaussian integrals. in this chapter we provide new results for the as- and as - mappings of curvature invariants. we prove new proofs for expansion theorems such as expansion - curved - point, as well as for expansion - plane - curve. we present an algorithm for computation of the magnitudes of the exponents. this algorithm is implemented in a laplace implementation and is shown to be either equal in complexity to the original one, or simpler than the laplace algorithm. a natural question to ask is which higher dimensional polynomials are constant in the expansion. we answer this question in the affirmative. provided that the metric of the metric space is not flat, as is the case for compact riemannian manifolds, there exists a naturally natural question of how many hyperbolic 2-manifolds are needed to express the symmetrization of a ricci - flat tangent vector. we show that the answer is indeed unity in the sense that the yang - yang tangent bundle of vela - vela dualities are not filled in. however, if we use non - local coordinates to define our coordinates, we can still express non - zero tensors in an automatic algorithm.
we present @xmath0-band integral field spectroscopy of the central region of the barred, starbursting spiral galaxy m83, obtained with the cirpass instrument on the gemini south telescope. the line - of - sight stellar velocity field shows that massive star formation ( sf ) continues to the north of the nucleus, with a concentration of sf extending to the south - west. it is dominated in visible light by the star - forming arc and a prominent ` ` dust lane '', at the position of the photometric and kinematic centres. but using also archival _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ images, and assuming that the hi@xmath1 fabry - perot velocity field is representative of the surrounding gas, we study the structure and properties of the circumnuclear region using the new data set. we use a harmonic decomposition model to constrain the position and nature of the kinematically centroid, and show that the best - fit to the data does not shift significantly the centroid position from that of the visible nucleus. the area of massive sf is spatially and spectrally resolved into a prominent set of bar - shaped lanes, separated by a prominent dust lane. these provide the first direct visual evidence for a hidden nucleus in this galaxy, although the exact nature of this hidden nucleus remains uncertain. the gas and dust properties of this region are also compared with those of the region outside the optical disk, in particular the gas velocity dispersion, which is enhanced relative to the starburst arc. we find that the gas inside the bar is subject to considerable local perturbations whose effects can not be accounted for by the harmonic model. we conclude that the observed in m83 is consistent with a previous suggestion that the nucleus is the site of a hidden galaxy merger, and that a dramatic external event such as a galaxy - galaxy interaction or a merger is required to account for the enhanced sf in this area.

we present a method for the synthesis and propagation of electromagnetic waves in metamaterials. the method is based on the interplay of spatial modes of the waveguide with the polarization of the background medium. it can be applied to the case of zero - mode condensation in a planar waveguide and allows one to tailor the dispersion laws of the modes to achieve a desired faraday rotation. we present a concrete example of the method in a graphene flake and show that, by properly choosing the refractive index, one can implement a tailored polarization rotation in the presence of a background medium with a uniaxial permittivity matrix. finally, we discuss the implementation of our method in the context of graphene. the manipulation of the electromagnetic field by means of nanoscale spatial modes has attracted a lot of interest recently. the idea to use the modes of a waveguide as scatterers has been developed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated in several systems. in this context, it is relevant to understand the effects that the different modes have on the interference of the field and can have a strong influence on the properties of the signal emitted by the device. for instance, the faraday effect, recently observed in some microwave rydberg - like effects, is a manifestation of the polarization - rotation of a microwave riemannian surface, a phenomenon which is not related to the normal - mode dispersion relation of the graphene flakes considered in the discussion. this effect has been considered as an important tool for characterizing different types of spintronics, e.g.low frequency gyroscopy, fiber grating and high - frequency conversion. it has been shown that the multiparameter interaction between two spatially separated waves can be totally characterized by a linear polarization tilting of the input signal, that is by a back - scattering term in the taylor expansion. the objective of the present paper is to develop a general methodology for the mode conversion into a common spatial mode coherently coupled to a microwave signal. in doing so, we address a number of different issues that may arise in practice and we suggest a possible solution to the problem of mode - dependent propagation in graphene flakes, i.e., the conversion of a single mode to its spatial counterpart at a common operating frequency and vice versa. we also discuss the effects of a frequency dependent refraction index on the efficiency of the transformation and we show that the method can be extended to other waveguide types with different mode phases. a large class of metam
the effect of paramagnetic ( magnetic ) defects on the muon spin precession frequency of the electrons in polycrystalline diamond was studied by @xmath0li spin resonance spectroscopy. it was found that the paramagnetic centre of the muonic atom in the 1s state of graphite has covalent chemical bonds with the three nearest carbon atoms and the fourth carbon atom has an unpaired spin ( one dangling bond ). the susceptibility of the carbon atom was found to be constant in the magnetic field of 14 koe. the effects of magnetic impurities, formed either by hydrogen or nitrogen ( the diameters of 3.5 mm and 1.3 mm ) in the acceptor centre, were studied with the quantum design squid magnetometer. the results of the measurements are presented in detail in magnetic fields of 95.2 oe and 20.0 koe for both samples. the durant magnetic moments of negative muons in graphite exhibit a linear dependence of their magnetic moment on the external magnetic field in the temperature range from 0 to 50 koe, and on the temperature variation of their frequency shift. in contrast, no linear dependence is observed in the synthetic carbon diamond sample studied. the development of an efficient toolbox for the measurement of magnetic properties of materials is one of the main goals of modern research. in this context, the search for new phases of nanophotonic compounds is of great importance because of their great potential for technological applications and the high tunability in manipulating and manipulating of magnetic moments. of particular interest are antiferromagnetic carbon allotropes such as n@xmath1 crystals. for example, the artificial crystals based on carbon nanotubes are highly desirable due to their outstanding mechanical properties and facile mechanical properties @xcite. synthetic diamond is relatively well isolated from environmental effects and its high optical depth makes it an ideal test bed for nanophotonics and quantum information processing. in the past few years a lot of research efforts are focused on its magnetic properties and on its mechanical properties ( e.g. the tunability of muon dynamics and precession ). recently, a large number of theoretical predictions and simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of magnetic and impurity effects on the mechanical properties of diamond materials. the predictions are based on the theoretical prediction of a simple model, namely, linear temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for muon rotations, and it is expected that the presence of magnetic defects, such as impurities in the carbon colour, would result
we investigate whether accretion onto the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the centres of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) can be characterised by the bondi accretion rate, which is thought to be a promising route for the gas supply to the smbh in the near future. we have studied the agn activity in 9 nearby, x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies including eight bcgs with recent _ chandra x ray observatory _ observations. in all these systems, we find that the increase in the hot gas density and temperature at the innermost measurement radius ( @xmath0 kpc ) is accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of the surrounding hot gas. we assume a simple power - law for the temperature and density profiles, and derive a new technique to estimate the bonduiscat line - of - sight velocity dispersion, which does not depend on the gas mass and the gas density. except for the central part of the central region of perseus cluster, where the density profile might have been affected by the angular momentum and/or temporal agn heating, we assume that the hot accretion proceeds through a bondi flow in a nearly hydrostatic equilibrium with a sound crossing time of about 0.1 myr. the cold gas accretion is assumed to proceed through an adiabatic process in the core, which triggers a cold gas disk and may produce the observed cold gas discs. the estimated agn jet powers are compared with the observed agn accretion rates. it is found that the minimum power required to offset by the slow conduction timescale and the lack of radiative cooling in the cool cores in the bcgs is insufficient to compensate for the radiative energy loss of the cluster cool cores. we propose a model in which attributes the efficiency of the cold accretion discs on the black hole surface to their buoyancy timescale. this model provides a reasonable fit to the observed gas temperature profiles and reduces the need for a large cold gas disc. besides, it provides a good explanation for the observed temperature gradients in the central regions of the lowest redshifts.

we present new observations of the wing ford band ( @xmath0=200335 ) and the cai line at 10345 for a sample of galaxies in the coma cluster region. compared to previous work, we probe the possible variations in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) with galaxy mass and age, and control for possible element abundance errors. the results are compared to the predictions of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models in the optical and near infrared, using new spectral synthesis models which account for abundance variations and possible confounding parameters. we find a range of imfs, ranging from a chabrier - like to a heavier - than - salpeter imf, and a strong supersaturation of red - sequence galaxies with [ mg / fe]@xmath20.1. the analysis of our sample is challenging because it must simultaneously account for all three of these ` ` classical '' imf - indicators ( the nai doublet, caii triplet, and so on ). perhaps to compensate for this tension, the models require enhancements of na / fe by up to an order of magnitude over the solar ratio. the stellar mass - to - light ratio is found to be sensitive to the level of enrichment of old stellar populations. conroy & van dokkum ( 2012b ) found that the imf favoured by the ssp models is a factor of 34 larger than that favoured by our sample, and that this trend is basically independent of the assumed abundance pattern. our analysis agrees with this result, but for different reasons : ( a ) we have few galaxies ( in our lowest sample ), and ( b ) we are sampling a very large range of velocity dispersions. our results, in conjunction with other work, allows us to probe the magnitude of galaxy mass variations for which the abundances of key elements ( na, fe, k ) are not yet well constrained.
this is the fourth paper of a series that aims to study the x - ray absorption properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) observed in the integral all - sky survey by integral. this first paper focuses on the sample of 272 agn observed by integral in the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) band. + the sample has two great strengths : a ) all sources have optical spectra, which means a secure identification and a measured redshift ( the only exception is the bl lac object rx j0137.7 + 5814 for which no redshift measure is available ), and b ) all objects have high resolution ( r@xmath0200.5 - 7.0 @xmath1 100 000 ) x - rays available, which provides a measure of the intrinsic absorption in each source. the sample spans a large range in source parameters and is therefore representative of the population of agn seen by integral for the first time. + in addition to the local seyferts, igr j22517 + 2218 ( a broad line qso ) and pks j04221.04 - 21104 ( a narrow line galaxy ), there are several peculiar objects ; peculiar objects belonging to the liner, xbong and type 2 qso classes are discussed. the fraction of absorbed agn is represented at 80 % and 50 % for the types 1 ( broad line ) and 2 ( narrow line ) agn respectively. we find a significant increase ( by a factor of 5 - 10 in terms of the 20 - 100 kev luminosity bin ) from source to source ; for the particular objects discussed here, the change is more gradual than the decrease in source luminosity. + most of the objects covered by the present sample show evidence for intrinsic absorption, i.e. absorbed type 1 agn, very heavily absorbed type 2 agn and type 3 qso s / liners. the average column density of column density at 20 kev in the sample is log n=0.0014 = 3.7 ; the value varies from 0.1 to 1.4 due to the large spread in source optical depths, but the overall flattening is generally consistent with the flattening implied by assigning an appropriate criterion to each optical class. at low redshift the column density is dominated by narrow objects, while at high redshift it belongs mostly to the narrow line ( bl ) class. + overall the sample demonstrates the advantages of optical absorption as a tool to test the agn unification theory.
in mathematical science, homology is a general procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules to a given topological space and/or manifold. it has become a popular approach for the characterization, identification and analysis of topological features in large data sets. in the past decade, persistent homology has been used as an efficient computational tool for the visualization, analysis and interpretation of nano - bio data. compared with traditional computational topology, geometric partial differential equations, i.e., the laplace - beltrami flow, can be utilized to proactively extract desirable topological traits from biomolecular data. however, compared to commonly used computational homology which results in truly metric free or coordinate free representations, persistent hology is able to embed geometric information to topological invariants so that the birth " and death " of isolated components, circles, rings, loops, holes, pockets, voids or cavities at all geometric scales can be monitored by topological measurements. as a proof of principle, we utilize differential geometry theory of surfaces to minimize the surface free energy,, resulting in an objective - oriented continuous differential equation, which branches into a differentiable hypersurface element representation. the proposed objective - orientation is further utilized to construct an objective functional to optimize desirable features in data. as an example, we show that the specific intrinsic feature of a beta barrel, namely the inner ring structure, is enhanced by the proposed geometric pdes. whereas, some undesirable topological feature due to the vietoris - rips complex can be effectively suppressed in the present approach. we further apply this geometric pde based persistence method to the quantitative prediction of fullerene isomer total curvature energies, for the first time in computational biophysics. persistence homology, differential geometry, full solvation analysis, protein folding, protein stability, protein flexibility, topological signature key laboratory, national institut des hautes tudes scientifiques, toulon - var, bp 110, f-75014 toulon, france.
the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) base station ( bs ) is expected to be capable of providing significant energy efficiency and system capacity improvements, but it is limited by the limited number of antenna elements ( aes ) available for the users. this motivates us to consider the promising techniques, such as large - scale mimo ( ls - mimo ) and spatial modulation ( sm)-mimo, which are attracting much attention as promising solutions to the multi - user signal detection problem at the bs. in this paper, we propose a joint transmission scheme for the ul - users in terms of sub - megaparsec single - carrier ( cpsc ) blocks, where only a single ae is required to serve multiple users. in order to boost the system performance, we first exploit the distributed sparsity of the aggregate sm signal and the group spersion of multiple aggregate sm signals in the proposed scheme. then, a group subspace pursuit ( gsp ) algorithm is developed to acquire the sparse solutions to under - determined linear systems, and we propose an appropriately structured compressive sensing ( scs)-based mud that solves the optimization problem with the aid of two steps. in the first step, we estimate the spatial constellation symbols, i.e., the index of @xmath0 users active antenna elements in a single cpsc block. subsequently, a joint sm transmission scheme is employed at the users, and the scs - based mud is exploited for improving the signal detection performance. we conduct simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mud with the conventional mmse - based and cs - based detectors. thereby it is demonstrated that the proposed sm - analogues are orders of magnitude more efficient and superior than the conventional ones. 99 t. beracle and b. j. m. jones, ` ` spectral efficiency and hardware cost of radio constellation symbols in cellular networks, '' ieee j. sel. top. quantum electron. * 20*(12 ), 13741379 ( 2010 ). k. srinivasan and k. sobolewski, _ transmission and processing of high - complexity spatial modulation systems _ ( springer - verlag, heidelberg, 2009 ). s. strauf, r. krmer, k. danzmann, and r. t. vellekoop, _ high - spectral - efficiency spatial modulation - based signal detectors for 5 g : a review _ ( spie, new j. phys. * 5*(5 ),
we present a study of the angle @xmath0 between the local magnetic field orientation and the underlying dust emission gradient orientation for a sample of 50 star - forming regions observed in high - resolution dust submillimeter observations with the submillieter telescopes and the sma and cso. we find that the magnetic field is found to strongly affect the morphology of the local gas, with a strong correlation between magnetic field misalignments and dust emission gradients. although not limited to dust polarization measurements, this observable is representative of group - based differences in the way that sources orientate themselves relative to the major axis of the underlying field. across the entire sample, sources with magnetic field orientations ( iia ) that are ( 1 ) slightly aligned with respect to the surrounding medium - to - high density region ( iib ), ( 2 ) preferentially lie parallel to the source minor axis ( ii ), or ( 3 ) have orientations that are maximally misaligned with respectto the surrounding region ( iii ). in this study, we have identified three distinct groups iia, iib and iii based on the orientation of their magnetic field, finding that roughly half of all the sources in iia show a magnetic field aligned with the iib source ( on average ), which is statistically slightly but not significantly different from the iia sources. iib sources, on average, have about twice as many magnetic field alignments as the iifr sources ( statistically and spectrally ), whereas iii sources average slightly but qualitatively different orientations. the observed differences in magnetic field properties between the samples iia and iib appear to point to a different level of coherence and co 2 co 2 - 1 transition, perhaps hinting at a scale - free self - similar origin for the observed trends. when combined with polarization - intensity gradient methods, this may hint at scale - dependence of magnetic field strength and/or tension force on the small to large scale, i.e., different than what is observed for the small scale magnetic fields probed by carma. a complete, population - averaged scaling analysis yields a tight correlation between the degree of misalignment of the source - averaged field alignment @x math_1 and the average physical field magnitude, suggesting a magnetic - field strength independent correlation, or a highly non - homogeneous distribution of weakly magnetized, non - collapsing systems. this work is part of a larger program, exploring the role of magnetic fields in the formation and evolution of star -
we give a proof of poynting s theorem that if a @xmath0-dimensional non - birefringent medium is non - dissipative, then its light cone has constant signature. specifically, if the lorentz metric of the medium is a nonsaturating one - to - one correspondence with a group of area metrics, then the light cones of the last 16 metaclasses in the classification of @xcite can not decompose into double light cones. this is a consequence of the fact that a fresnel surface decomposes into a double light cone when it has a polynomial factorisation into a linear form. the case where this is true is studied in detail. the study of the propagation speed of electromagnetic waves has been a subject at the forefront of modern physics for more than thirty years. one of the most fundamental problems in physics is the determination of propagation speeds of light. by the application of _ schrdinger s equation _ and other formulations of maxwell s equations, this problem has led to important progresses. it has been shown that by using geometric optics it is possible to measure the speeds of different electromagnetic waves traveling in a medium with different wave speeds. the most studied mediums are usually described by _ skewon - free _ mediums, that is, mediums that have a non - degenerate light cone. a _ nonsaturated medium _ is a medium that has a light cone that has constant propagation speed and is not dissipative. examples include uniaxial crystals and calcite. in this paper we are particularly interested in the last few decades in understanding the so - called _ factoring - out _ relation. it is known that the cosmology contains examples where the light cone of a medium is exactly invertible, namely, it has only 21 free components. the main result of this paper is theorem [ thm : factormedium ] which characterises the speed of different polarised electromagnetic waves as a function of direction. the proof of this theorem is different from similar results for dielectrics, cotangent bundles and fresnel surfaces, but it is of independent interest.
we present a statistical model for the redshift evolution of the mean absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen ( @xmath0 ), conveniently parametrized by input statistics for the ly@xmath1 absorption line. we compare the predictions of this model to the observations of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ), in order to distinguish between their predicted properties when compared to the corresponding predictions of the monte carlo hydrodynamics model. in particular, we find that the observed evolution of @0 is lognormal, irrespective of the presence of lyman limit systems, which strongly indicates that the difference in method and the heterogeneity of the samples of different surveys, especially for sources with identical intrinsic spectra, introduces an artificial bias in its observed evolution, in particular in its scatter. we thus find that it is not possible to estimate the mean change in the magnitude of a source at a given redshift by integrating the spectrum of the source over many lines - of - sight. to rectify this bias, we therefore propose to model the source - attenuation term in terms of the cosmic flux decrement, which is calculated by an ensemble of sdss qso spectra for a wide redshift range. we present the first results of this statistical model, in combination with the results of detailed simulations of the formation of structures in the universe. in this paper we mainly discuss the implications of the present results for the cosmological model with a density field that varies in space and time, with its evolution driven mainly by the hubble expansion, the radiation field of ionising uv sources, and the collapse of structures due to gravity. finally, we compare these and previous measurements to the outcomes of each model for which intensity profiles are expected to develop as a result of gravitational attraction.

this series of lectures at the zakopane school of physics concentrates on multi - particle production in hadronic collisions at high energies in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework. the state of the art in this field was covered at that time in a set of lectures. the theme of these lectures is to develop a systematic theoretical framework for describing multi - parton correlations in qcd. the formalism is fairly general and applicable to any field theory with strong, time dependent classical sources. the subject is described in detail in lecture i, with particular emphasis on how one can calculate the average multiplicity of gluons and quarks produced in proton - nucleus collisions in the regge limit of small @xmath0 and fixed momentum transfer squared @xma0. in lecture ii, we compute the non linear classical yang - mills equations to leading order in the multiplicity for any distribution of such sources. lecture iii presents a derivation of the unitarization formula for the propagator of a gluon pair. in the final lecture, we present numerical simulations of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) multiplicity. the results are very general and very similar to the results of real time simulations of rhic. in particular, we discuss how the rapid fluctuations of the classical fields in the weibel instability, first studied in the context of electromagnetic plasmas, may provide insight into the origins of early thermalization. we also present several applications of the cgc approach to rhic phenomenology. the glasma is considered when two sheets of colored glass collide, producing a large number of partons. a cartoon depicting this collision is shown in fig. [ fig : glasma ]. the rapid growth of parton densities is depicted in the second panel. the source densities discussed in this lecture, as well as the one described in lecture iii, are given as the products of unintegrated distributions in both the proton and the nucleus convoluted with the matrix element for the interactions squared. the problem of limiting fragmentation is discussed in the third panel. a simple power counting in the coupling constant for the qcd propagator is presented. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 )
we give a quantitative test for the bose - gas picture of the bilinear - biquadratic antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field. the product - wavefunction renormalization group method ( pwfrg ) calculations of the @xmath0 curve of this system yield exact values of the magnetization and the effective coupling constant for a large system with spin-@xmath1 explicitly calculated with respect to the system size. in contrast to the conventional conventional spin - wave - theoretical approach, the p wfrg - calculated curves allow us to make quantitative estimation of the value of the ` ` effective '' coupling constant. the value seems to be negative, in agreement with previous results, but, because of the smallness of the coupling constant, it amounts to ` ` kinematical interaction '' between the spin waves. this amounts to a local ` ` boundary '' of the phase diagram. on raising the magnetic field from zero, the system undergoes a level - crossing transition between the singlet ground state and the lowest - energy triplet state. the low - lying excitations admit fermionic interpretation. as a result, just above the excitation gap ( the so - called ` ` haldane gap '' ), the ground state is singlet and non - magnetic, while at higher magnetic fields, the excitations become both single- and triplet. in this sense, it seems to provide a better description of the bulk magnetization than the conventional ferromagnetic - singleton and composite - multiferroic approaches. in addition, the possible existence of the triplet ground state, if it exists, will be of interest to future tunable quantum computation. away from the saturation field, we consider two - body scattering problem to obtain the ground - state - to - excitation ratio of the system. for this purpose, we have also reconsidered the idea of down - spin as a particle ". our consideration shows that, in this view, down - spins can be viewed as ` ` pure '' spin chains with the simple ` ` ` one - particle '' excitation. accordingly, both the conductivity and the spin-1/2 spin-0/2 coupling constant can be shown to be positive. the present result provides a quantitative agreement between the present calculation and previous results in supporting the validity of both the single - particle excitation theory for the full isotropic and single - spin magnetization process.
we study the opinion dynamics of the 2-vector hegselmann and krause ( hk ) compromise model by means of a rate equation for a continuum distribution of opinions. in the presence of a parameter @xmath0, called the _ confidence bound _, which expresses the compatibility among the agents in the opinion space, we find a peculiar kind of synchronization, in which each individual tends to change his natural opinion changing rate. we could interpret this as a sort of bipolarism, i.e. an equilibrium between conservative and progressist components. the coupling between the opinions of the individuals is so strong that whenever two opinions reach agreement, we observe a single final cluster. as a result, we show that the discrete opinion dynamics in the limit of an infinite number of agents can be solved numerically. this allows us to explore the final form of the system and to observe a marked increase in the level of synchronization among the opinions. opinion formation models are very successful to describe the interconnections among the individuals in a society @xcite. much effort has been recently devoted to their detailed analysis in order to understand how the evolution of a society depends on the decisions, opinions and behaviors of individuals. different models are often compared, e.g., in terms of the ` ` culture '' either specific to a specific society or to a general phenomenon in the society. + the aim of this paper is to introduce us to a new kind of opinion dynamics, different from the others, that can be applied to society as a whole and that can provide an important insight into the issue of opinion formation. opinion forming models are based on the dynamics of individuals opinions, on the interaction between individuals, and on the behavior of the social group that represents the social unit. + in the hk model the relationship between individuals opinions is not formal, but it can be represented by a graph, where the vertices represent the agents and the edges relationships between agents. the graph represents a possible ` ` community '', where people live in a social group and they can either interact with each other or they can be connected with other individuals through the social network. this last feature is very important in the functioning of social groups, because if they do not cooperate they will definitely behave according to different social principles. + we start by a discussion of the above-@xmath1 assumptions, which allow us to consider the case of a completely connected graph and with a squared opinion space. in this case we will assume that the dynamics always acts from the edges of this
we consider the problem of entanglement in a single - photon system, where the spatial shape and polarization degrees of freedom are effectively entangled. in this scenario, the quantum state of the photon would be described by the spin - orbit state, whose density matrix has the same form as in the single - excitation manifold. we introduce a measure for delocalization that makes the sum of the contributions of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) and polarization degree of freedom take the form of @xmath0 $ ]. this measure is defined in terms of the degree of coherence of the excitation, and is related to the distribution of the directions in which the first and second order correlation functions can be bettered. in order to quantify coherence, we make use of the concurrence. we compare the result of measuring maximum coherence with that of measuring local ( i.e., not spatially extended ) coherence. finally, we introduce the concept of maximum localization, that is, measurement of the extent of localization at which one of the two photons interacts nonlinearly with the remaining photon, in contrast to the case when only one photon is present in the excited state. by making use of this concept, we are able to describe the simplest one - photon quantum state that can be produced by a spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) process, and we show that it is qualitatively equivalent to the ` ` single - crystal '' state. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 p. pringsheim, ` ` zwei bemerkungen ber den unterschied von lumineszenz - und temperaturstrahlung, '' zeitschrift fr physik * 57 *, 739746 ( 1929 ). p. ben - abdallah and s.- a. biehs ` ` observation of long - lived electronic coherences in photosynthetic complex '', phys. rev. lett. * 100 *, 10411093 ( 1999 ). j. c. knight, p. s. jessen, and h. j. kimble, _ light harvesting : principles and applications _ ( springer - verlag, heidelberg, 2009 ). k. a. nasser, a. v. sergienko, and n. g. lewenstein ` ` manipulation of single photons for quantum information processing '', rev. mod. phys. * 82 *, 123602 ( 2010 )
we further develop the geometric theory of @xmath0-adic ( or nonarchimedean ) fractal strings, given by the first author in _ fractal geometry and number theory _, along with the associated theory of complex dimensions and, especially, of fractal tube formulas. the latter was first developed by michel lapidus and l hng in _ the weyl berry conjecture for fractal drums and its connection with the riemann hypothesis. such a theory, which was later refined and generalized by those same authors, is one of the main goals of this paper. in particular, we focus on the 3-adic cantor string, for which a simple formula for the volume of the ` inner'tube of a self - similar fractal string is provided in terms of the geometric zeta function of the string. the spectral operator is rigorously defined and studied within a proper functional analytic setting. we then introduce a proper notion of minkowski dimension and content, building on the results of [ inner tube ], in order to provide a better understanding of how the ( nontrivial ) spectral operator reflects the ( real ) dimensions of the fractal set. for this purpose, we also provide a unified derivation of one of key results in ( archimedene ) cantor theory, namely, that the ( noncommutative ) geometric counting function of a fractal complex variable is asymptotically converges to a finite value inside the critical strip, where all the ( unobservable ) complex zeros of the star - like riemarr zeta functions reside. this provides a unified proof of an important but hitherto unproved result of the second author in the same context, although our methods and results may be slightly more general. as a further illustration of our results, we computationally solve for a finite subset of the fundamental equations of ( non)arcminute - string theory in the weak - field approximation. in the process, we show that the constant of proportionality is equal to the geometric dimension of the set of ` infinite'fractal spacetimes. finally, we argue that a finite - size representation of the hodge star, once quantized, can be used to represent the geometry of spacetime at very small scales ( below the planck scale ), thereby providing a possible means of extending to a very high level of perturbation theory the recently proposed fractal resolution formula. various possible applications and applications are briefly discussed.
most galaxies experience intense star formation episodes at high redshifts. the cosmic star formation history of the universe ( sfhu ) is dominated by star forming galaxies with total star formation rates @xmath0 m@xmath2/year. high redshift galaxies thus provide a panchromatic picture of the formation of supermassive black holes and their host spheroids. the rate of star formation in these galaxies is on average five times higher than in the milky way, consistent with the theory that the black holes form before the lower mass stellar mass of the host galaxy. high resolution co observations of the molecular gas and dust reveal the signatures of this strongly enhanced star formation process. the ratios of co luminosity to far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities indicate that the fir luminosity is proportional to the massive star formation rate in the host galaxies. this correlation has implications for the co emission - line tracer, which is now a good tracer for the total molecular gas mass, and for quantifying the energetic properties of the ism. since co is optically thick on small scales ( ie. the [ cii ] line traces the cnm and photon - dominated regions associated with star formation ), high resolution submillimeter ( submm ) observations are beginning to pin down the fine structure of the co emitting gas. the evla project has completed its first decade of observations with the 1.3 m and 12 ghz line - of - sight spectrometer, providing the first pan - chromatic studies of the dense gas tracer to reveal all the key elements of the complext process. these studies will become a major complementarity to optical and near - ir studies in the coming years. in addition to deep in - plane co observations using the nrao very large array ( vla ) and the trains, we expect semi - periodic or outburst detections of dense gas via our new 10-marpeter imager, the deep evla next generation array ( nvla - a ). this will be a major step towards our understanding of the process of galaxy formation and the role of dust and gas in the final stages of cosmic structure formation.
we describe a vortex model in 1 + 1 dimensions that contains kinks and also allows for twist. we start with the o(3 ) sigma model where the 1-parameter family of kinks is labeled by the azimuthal field @xmath0. this model is known to be completely integrable. similarly we need a one parameter family of monopole solutions and this can be obtained by extending the model to o(4 ). however, our model contains embedded spaces where the dynamics is that of the sine - gordon model direction. therefore, we should include a twist similar to the one for kinks. we then describe the creation of sphalerons in the electroweak model. since magnetic helicity is conserved in a highly conducting plasma, we conclude that the _ convergence _ of electromagnetic helicity can possibly lead to the production of sphherons, and hence also the twist with a relative twist. the usefulness of magnetic monopoles may be conjectured based on another line of reasoning. in highly conducting plasmas, although well defined, may be open to experimental investigation. for example, a section of a nuclei in its helicity state is called a ` ` skyrmion '' since it is composed of a magnetic monopole and an antimonopole. one of the more interesting phenomena that has been observed in condensed matter physics is that some nuclei are stable in the helicity ( or baryon number ) but there is a large number of possible nuclei. this phenomenon has been studied in great detail in refs. @xcite. it seems like a natural way to study the properties of nuclei, and to attempt to understand the physics of their formation. we will start by describing the model. then we will study specific examples and apply the results to our topic.
we present high cadence @xmath0 observations of the solar atmosphere, obtained using the latest ground- and space - based observatories. prominent oscillatory behaviour is detected throughout the optical and euv image sequences, with remarkable similarities found between the detected wave modes. the observed oscillations are best described as upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic waves, which originate in ultra - low - density ( ud ) structures located in the photospheric umbra. a prominent fan structure in the simultaneous coronal euv images, likely to represent a recent addition to the sdss / dst s imaging capabilities, is observed to extend out of the photosphere, into the chromosphere, and into the corona. by considering the extension of magnetic flux tubes from the solar surface out into the upper solar atmosphere we argue that their radial expansion can be used to propagate the observed waves outward. the resulting wave propagators are able to provide a significant contribution to the damping of coronal slow - mode waves. we suggest that the observed fan structures may serve as efficient conduits for such waves, in particular for those waves that originate from the uds. by combining our observations with a multi - wavelength approach, we investigate the nature of the chromospheric intensity and velocity components, and their dependence on wavelet power. we find that the measured relative intensity perturbations are not consistent with the model predictions, and that the power lost in intensity oscillations is more due to physical sources, such as the thermal conductivity of the coronal gas. finally, we observe the presence of rapid oscillations in the sunspot umbrae, with a period of 3.5 minute oscillations. the mode of these oscillations exhibits considerable power, with regions encompassing the active regions displaying more than three orders - of - magnitude stronger power than the background umbra ; we conclude that the generation of these three minute intensity waves is a robust process.

we have performed a homogeneous photometric and spectroscopic wide - field survey of globular clusters ( gcs ) in the local group galaxy m31 ( triangulum ) covering a field of @xmath0 3@xmath1 3 centered on m31. we have derived new radial velocities for 150 gcs in this survey, and 257 gcs previously known in our previous work ( @xcite, paper i ). the total number of 504 gcs found in the survey is now 321 gcs, of which 211 have been measured. in this paper we present the kinematic properties of the m31 gc system as a function of the projected distance along the major axis. we find 50 friendless gcs and 40 non - neighbor gcs which are showing a strong rotation around the minor axis. the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion of the metal - poor gcs are similar to each other and are about twice larger than the rotation amplitude. the gcs with a measured velocity and metallicity are generally more metal - rich, while those without x - ray detection show weak rotation. in contrast to the milky way, we find that there are several substructures in the spatial distribution of both metal - weakly and strongly rotating gcs along the main axis of m31 : ( i ) there is an extended rotating bulge of about 3 kpc, ( ii ) the gc systems in the bulge show a central concentration of about 40 %, and ( iii ) there are gcs much more concentrated in the halo field than in the disk and in the thin disk. the most important result of this study is that there is a non - rotating, pressure - supported population in m31, which is not seen in the galaxy - bulge. the intermediate - age metal - old population is found to be located in the region close to the major disk ( 615 kpc ), while the younger population is spread over the entire halo. we discuss these results in the framework of the monolithic collapse model according to which the stellar halo is formed by the rapid collapse of a monolithic protogalactic cloud in a dynamical time scale of about 0.1 gyr and accretion / merging based on a semi - analytic multizone chemical evolution model. in addition to this, we also discuss the formation and evolution of the globular cluster halo in terms of the different scenarios for the formation, evolution, and energetics of the h
we study experimentally nonlinear interactions of mutually incoherent beams associated with different floquet - bloch modes of a photonic lattice with self - focusing nonlinearity. the setup enables us to control the beam widths and amplitudes. such flexibility enabled us to reveal novel effects for nonlinear beam propagation regimes that were not accessed in other experimental studies of interband mutual focusing. we observe transitional mutual focusing and defocusing of waves exhibiting diffraction of different magnitude and sign, and study in detail discrete beam break - up induced by highly localized fields. 99 l. mandel and e. wolf, _ optical coherence and quantum optics _ ( cambridge, 1995 ). a. a. malygin, a. n. penin, and a. v. sergienko, ` ` toward single - wave mixing in photonic crystals, '' phys. rev. lett. * 99 *, 16331636 ( 1999 ). p. coullet, l. p. chen, b. f. sanders, and b. e. jones, _ vector optical solitons _ ( taylor & francis, boca raton, 2009 ). m. gregora, m. hewitson, and r. w. boyd, _ self - control of optical wave propagation in periodic media _ ( springer, 2010 ), l.- m. duan, c. huang, t. c. kang, and p. m. gaikhs, '' arxiv:0910.2159v1 [ physics.optics ] * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ). k. mattle, h. weinfurter, p. j. stewart, and c. d. bustamante, _ theory of spontaneous emission in plasmonic crystals _ ( plenum press, 2008 ). g. takahashi, w. taki, k. kobayashi, and m. matsubara, _ wavelength shaping of single - photon transients in a nonlinear dielectric lattice _ ( wiley - interscience, 2000 ). i.v. konishi and k.w.o. honell, _ principle and applications of coupled nonlinear optical interactions in periodic lattices, _ j. opt. soc. _ * 12 *, 213902 ( 2006 ). r. bouwmeester, j.- w. pan,
we develop ideas for the design and fabrication of new robust magnetic materials for applications ranging from magnetoencephalography to biosensing. our ideas are based on the observation that when a magnetic source is placed in a cylindrical shell in a uniform applied field, its radial and angular permeabilities are the same in the shell and all the magnetic energy is transferred from the inner to the outer regions, making the shell material homogeneous and anisotropic. in the case when the source is in the interior, the shell energy is totally transferred to the hole, and the material is homogeneously and isotropic ; no energy is needed in the inner domain. we show that for large applied fields, our ideas can be applied to increase the sensitivity of magnetic sensors ranging from squids to magnetoresistance or hall sensors. in addition, we address the issue of enhanced magnetic energy transfer between magnetic sources and the exterior and find that our results can be interpreted in terms of a separation of two or more magnetic slabs separated by a free - space gap. this leads to a strategy to enhance the surface area of magnetic fields in the exterior by up to 50 %, and up to 100 %, depending on the value of the applied field. wireless communication may also be enhanced by combining our ideas with those for power wireless transmission. any physical implementation of these ideas would require magnetic materials with properties similar to those of superconducting and ferromagnetic materials. the possibilities to use our structures to generate new magnetic materials or to create devices with enhanced properties are discussed. magnetic fields are abundant in nature and have been considered for many fields @xcite. in particular interest is in magnetic sensors, where a large magnetic field is required in order to detect a magnetic field in a given position in the body, for example to measure magnetic activity in the brain. usually, a magnetic sensor is considered to be sensitive to deformable magnetic surfaces because its sensitivity is limited by the minimum number of magnetic fluxes allowed in the given by the given field. for sensing magnetic activity, different magnetic sensors would require different values of the magnetic field and the permeability of the material. for example, a current national science foundation program in nanotechnology, in its first year of operation, will require a field exceeding 2 mjy. because of the current technological developments, more and more magnetic sensors will need to be developed and their applications will be limited by increasing the range of their sensitivity. existing magnetic sensors for different applications will probably be based on existing and coming technologies. in this paper
we compare two relativistic approximate models, the slow rotation expansion of hartle & thorne ( 1968 ) and the exact vacuum solution by manko _ et al. _ ( 2000a, 2000b ). from the stable models in the ht sequence we choose those which have the same gravitational mass and angular momentum as a given numerical model. we quantify the possible overlap of the two approximations. we comparably split the three vacuum exterior spacetimes. we calculate the quadrupole moment @xmath0 as a function of the rotation rate, and compare our results with the circumferential isco radii in the notation of the full einstein - maxwell system ( 2003 ). assuming a typical rotation rate of 1,000 ns, the fastest rotating star is found to be the pulsar psr j1939 + 2134. we use our numerical results to describe the geometrical structure of the weyl scalars and to characterise the non - type - d - ness of the spacetime. as a consequence of the rotating stellar structure, the multipole structures of the most relevant layers of the exterior spacetime ( that is, the lowest - order mass and current multipoles ) would be very useful for astrophysical applications. for example, the detection of gravitational waves emitted by particles in orbit around bhs and compact stars provides an approximate description of a neutron star. we find that the slow - rotation approximation is _ an excellent approximation to the isco predicted by numerical solutions _, relative errors being smaller than 1 % for astrophysically relevant rotation rates, down to the fastest observed millisecond pulsar operator of the variable star corot. in the second part of the paper we compare the results from our simulations with those obtained by other approximate methods, based on a new multi - domain spectral method independently developed by sibgatullin ( 1991 ). we conclude that the numerical calculations presented in this paper are of sufficient accuracy to be used as a guide in the study of rapidly rotating stellar objects.
we postulate that the organization of adipose tissue is driven by a self - organization process driven by bidirectional mechanical interactions between the cells and fibers. to test this hypothesis, we develop a two - dimensional model of a fibrous network composed of cross - linked fiber elements and examine quantitatively the properties of a large class of observed lobular structures, including the clusters of adipocytes and their relationship to the extracellular matrix. we show that the emergence of cell and fiber structures can be driven by simple mechanical interactions as the result of a pattern of small - scale and large - scale stresses induced by the pressure exerted by the growing adipocytes. our mathematical model predicts the existence of new cell clusters surrounded by a disorganized network of weakly linked fibers. moreover, we find that the fiber - connected units forming the network display anisotropy in the shape of the final structures, reflecting the influence of the vasculature. these results suggest that the decision whether a cell cluster develops into an adipocyte is principally driven by its ability to differentiate from a single fiber network. * organization ofilibmolecular tissue in the human organism has been the subject of intense research since the early days of human evolution @xcite. since then a broad range of cell types have been observed, from single cell clusters in the knee, ankle, knee, hip and quadrupole tissue, to complex networks of linked fibers in the brain, the liver, spore and oropharynx. at the same time, there has been growing interest in understanding the relation between cell organization and the tissue function, since it has been linked to a host organism s physiological functions as well as its pathological behavior. one of the key questions to answer in this regard is the how such system organelles self - organize into specific ordered patterns, i.e., how organs or spore networks. to this end, numerous models have been proposed in order to explain the origin and function of particular cell types or morphologies found in human and animal tissue. however, only a few have been able to provide a general understanding of the detailed organization of biological tissue, in particular the origin of the different morphologies observed in human cells. to arrive at this conclusion, we have performed a series of monte - carlo simulations of mixtures of isotropic and nematic particles interacting with a mixture of actin and inert polymer polyethylene glycol ( peg ) and observed that actin filaments bundle together when a threshold concentration of peg is reached.
we describe the use of an electrometer to measure the statistics of nearby charge states in a superconducting tunnel junction. by measuring coulomb oscillations, the population of charge states on an island in the normal state can be directly measured. we demonstrate that this can be used to constrain the bias voltage to be between 1.5 and 4.0v, depending on the measurement bias. simulations and measurements confirm the existence of a current plateau in between the nearest charge states. the back action of the electrometer on the occupied charge states of the island 2 leads to a strong excess of electrons on the second island and a suppression of quasiparticle currents between the two islands. these results allow us to use the current measurements to directly determine the average population of electron states over a nanosecond timescale. in the last few years, superconductivity has emerged as a viable and versatile tool for the study of many- and many - body phenomena in condensed matter physics. its remarkable feature is the possibility to create devices that remain robust even in the face of strong electron correlations. recent experiments have demonstrated the normal - state stability of superconductors such as the tunnel diodes @xcite and the recently discovered high - transition - temperature ( htsc ) mott insulator - insulator ( tis ) @xcire. in this article, we describe a novel method for measuring the statistics in superconductor - electronic devices. by using an electrom electrometer, an external bias voltage device can be built that does not rely on the coupling of the tunnel junction and has a very small dielectric bias voltage. this allows us to continuously monitor and control the local charge state populations on nearby islands. the possibility of measuring local charge states has enabled the experimental discovery of several new charge states recently, i.e., five different charge states for comparison with the five observed in the @xmath0 state @xcitethat were determined by fermi _ et al._@xcite. the population states that can be measured in the 100-mhz range are very similar to those that have been predicted theoretically. it has been verified that the measurement of just one of these charge states will bias the system above the threshold voltage, leaving only one more charge state to be measured. the significance of this method is twofold. first, the number of observable charge states is limited by the scaling of the occupation probability of the charge states with these devices. second, in the 0.75 ev state, where
recent theoretical and experimental work on the photothermal properties of transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) emphasizes the potential for such materials to feature novel topological characterizations. for this purpose, we develop an effective low - energy description of the photoproduction of a monolayer ws@xmath0 using a combination of bulk and thin - film dipole quantum wells. this approach bridges the gap between the rapidly developing field of semiconductor quantum wells and topological insulators out of equilibrium, thereby providing a route towards achieving the latter in an experimentally attainable setting. we show that the three - band nature of the floquet - bloch bands in the remaining brillouin zone leads to a new mechanism to ` switch'on or off one or two chiral edge modes with optical band - gap optical irradiation. the resulting photo - induced gap in the single - particle spectrum scales linearly with pump strength, suggesting substantial energy scales already at low fields, while also ensuring minimal detuning from the band edge. the theoretical analysis of the out - of - equilibrium band inversions connects directly with equilibrium _ ab initio _ calculations, suggesting that the predictions are robust to microscopic detail and should be observable in a range of monolayers tmdc materials. finally, our study suggests a promising strategy to predict and design topological band structures that remain robust to intense pump fields, in particular in the context of potential linearization - dependent multi - photon effects. topological materials consist of crystalline semiconductors with a mixed valence band ( cb ) and a higher - energy conduction band ( xb ). in the simplest picture, the two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure of these materials is determined solely from symmetry, where the cb serves as the energy sink and the xb as the fuel. a key challenge for driving the system strongly is to simultaneously suppress the required changes to the equilibrium band structure while simulteanously mitigating the inevitable absorption and heating induced by the high - energy processes. recent theoretical work on graphene with a gap has suggested that the solution may be in the form of photovoltaics ( pvcs ) with a band gap @xcite, in which the mid - landau levels ( mmws ) in the @xmath1-periodic s - wave superposition state at zero temperature can be realized in terahertz - maxima of the crystal potential. in contrast, it is envisioned that the zero - temperature topological surface
we present simultaneous photometric, polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of the young main sequence star fr cnc. the photometry was carried out with the taurus-2 instrument at the crimean astrophysical observatory. a total of 58 echelle and long - slit spectra have been obtained and analysed. the spectra show that the main sequence velocity field is broadened due to stellar activity. the ca ii h & k lines are formed at different atmospheric altitudes, while the h i doublet at high latitude show significant polarization. we derive a mean rotation velocity of 17.8 @xmath0 1.6, which is in good agreement with the value derived from the doppler imaging, assuming that the circumstellar material is homogeneous. the linear polarization, however, is higher than the theoretical value expected for stellar activity, indicating that additional mechanisms are required to explain the observed polarization. from the 2004 spectra we find an average heliocentric radial velocity ( rv ) per unit heliogentric radius of @xfig@xmath1 = 5.7 km s@xday, which supports the notion that rotational activity is distributed over the surface of the star. an anticorrelation between the rv and the inclination of the stellar axis, which was previously found for the k1v star, is now seen only for the g5v star. we find that the average rv of the 2008 photometrical event is also consistent with the period obtained from the 2006 november 23 photometry. the non - detection of any other flares except for the epoch of _ asas-3 _ observations in 2006 - 2007 implies that this object has a low frequency of flares. in fact, we detect two brightening episodes in the 2007 photometry, which are probably related to the same brightening event observed in the same period. a possible interpretation of these events is that spots are accumulated on the photosphere and released in the direction of the current activity.
we present a numerical method to simulate single shots of an @xmath0-boson system by means of a multiconfigurational schrdinger equation for interacting fermions. the algorithm is based on the perturbative mctdhb approach and uses a plane wave discrete variable representation to represent all orbitals and operators. we obtain positionally resolved maps of each particle from a tensor - to - scalar transformation of a general many - boson wave function. the coordinates of individual particles are drawn from the probability distribution under a fixed orbital prescription. we investigate the dependence of the positions of the particles on the value of the contact interaction and on the time - dependent bose - einstein condensate properties of the boson. the influence of perturbation theory on the dynamics of interacting bosons has been studied in a number of different systems. for instance, in superfluid helium condensates @xcite single spin - orbit interactions have been observed for the first time by probing the single - particle motion in a two - dimensional fluid by the spectroscopic measurement of the scattering length. in three dimensional superfluid systems the situation is more complicated as one introduces orbital fluctuations in the system and the interaction potentials become more and more important. in two dimensional systems such variations are limited by the finite size of the system. with the advent of soliton - nucleon interactions the gross - pitaevskii soliton ( gps ) soliton solution on an infinite line has been proposed as an efficient numerical scheme to treat the problem of many - body dynamics of a trapped two - body system in a fermionic bath. in this work we propose and apply the gps in a numerical simulation of a bosonic system. the objective is to generate a fast enough computer algorithm to run numerical simulations of single shot, i.e. to reduce the computational cost of simulating a tight harmonic confinement experiment, which is very useful for high - resolution experiments. + + * program summary * + + _ title of program : _ single shots + _ catalogue identifier : _ + _ program obtainable from : _ cpc program library, queen s university of belfast, n. ireland + _ computer for which the program is designed and others on which it has been tested : _ sunyaev - titishvili - korolkova - ovchinnikov. + _ operating system(s ) : _ all systems with adaptive optics + _ programming language used : _ fortran (
we describe the morphological development of plumes created in autocatalytic reactions, in which fresh reactant solution is added to a laminar plume which is propelled upwards by viscous forces. we describe the various stages in this process, from the moment of first contact with the reaction front until the plume head reaches a steady state in which it pinches - off. an example of this process is the generation of three plume heads, the evolution of which is well described by a stochastic model. in this simulation, the number of pinch - offs is varied, and the morphology of the plumes is varied. moreover, we consider different concentrations of the glycerol, ranging from 0.3 to 40 %. the simulation results reveal a more complex picture of the flow development during the early stages of plume propagation, compared to the non - reacting case. an important qualitative difference between the two models is the development of a steady - state conduit flow below the head which is not affected by the initial movement of the head. we show that, in the early regime, this conduit only acts as a conduit to transport viscous fluid, and that it has no functional role in the subsequent growth of the subsequent plume. the conduit does not interact with the moving head, so that upwelling flow in the head does not try to reach the head, and no buoyancy flux is delivered to the head by the moving fluid above the conduit. this shows that an autocoatalytic plume still plays not only the role of a conduit, but that it is instead a conduit provider for upwelled fluid traversing the active region. finally, we discuss how the formation of the conduit can qualitatively differentiates plume types based on the growth and end - to - end distance in a variety of reactant solutions. the concept of using a reaction front to drive a reaction is as old as turbulently linked to modern day chemistry, and yet the rate at which modern - day plumes form and grow has remained a subject of considerable interest. a number of recent experimental and theoretical work has begun to elucidate the processes involved in plume morphogenesis, such as the growth of amphiphilic molecules in solution @xcite, formation, turbulence, and buoyancy transport in the cell cytoskeletal bodies of biomolecules such as amphipathic acid and centium disulfide ( e.g. iodide, iodide - based anosulfide
we report the results of a measurement of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element, @xmath0, and the form factor, @xcite, of the semileptonic decaying particle, the signal lepton and the neutrino, identified via the belle detector at kekb. we use a large solid angle spectrometer, based on the 1.5 t superconducting solenoid magnet at the kekb asymmetric collider, to collect a large data sample of 1.8 fb@xmath1 semilepton pairs from the decay of the charm meson @xoul. the data sample covers the range of negative squared four - momentum losses in the plane of negative energy and has enough resolution to measure the missing energy and the excess of energy in the center of mass ( cm ) frame to a point of zero recoil. we extract the energy and momentum from the corresponding missing particle and the cm frame ; this information is correlated with the six - momentum measurements in the previous analysis using a different analysis. from the missing momentum we measure the following quantities : the three - momentum vector of the lepton, the energy - momentum correlation coefficient of the produced particles and the ratio of the two - momentum transfers in the direction perpendicular and parallel to the leptons ( missing energy " ) ; the amplitude of the third - momentum transfer, the ratio ( excess photon energy ) ; and the shape of the anomalous longitudinal component of the electromagnetic shower contribution to the charged particle triaxiality. we estimate the branching fraction from the inclusive decay rate and the corresponding differential decay rate. the results are as follows. = -1.5 cm = 23.cm # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) # = cmr10 scaled 2 to * # 4 * # 1 desy 09 - 050 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * measurement of ckm matrix elements + and the scalar and vector form factors + from inclusive decay rates * + ( # 1,#2,#3)*p.a. belle ( kyoto institute for nuclear research, sokendai, tokyo 169 - 8551, japan * abstract * + m. bernardini, h. bilokon, w.in. bizot, a. borselli, and t. boudry, ` ` observation of a
we identify the action map of the quiver - representations of the three string braid group @xmath0 to the representation spaces of corresponding local quivers, that is, to the identity space of one quiver to the other. using the theory of luna slices we give a partial solution to the problem of classifying simple representations of a finite irreducible component of the triangle. the action is made explicit, by using the zariski dense representation theory, and the quotient set of simple eigenspaces is shown to be a rational family of representations. the general result follows from a result of aidan schofield and relies on the fact that the representation space of a quiver is organised into sections corresponding to its representation spaces. msc ( 2010 ) : 57r15 ( primary ) ; 57n10, 57m20 ( secondary ). this paper is in the ` xxx ` archive as:*`https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2f978-3-540-70575-8.html. see for example @xcite. the historical development of this paper and its extensions can be found in the references at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formalism-mathematics/abstract.cfm. the original interest in the study of quivers was due to the early work of f. deacon, j. higgs, and later work of p. deffayet, r. warburton, c. kuhlmey, and c. henkelman. this work produced a number of important results : ( i ) in the last few years there has been a great interest in understanding quivers one - dimensional representation spaces, as a way to probe the topology of 3-dimensional braid groups, and ( ii ) in understanding their action - spaces which are, to a large extent, related to the 3-manifold structure of the modular group one of order two and three ( as concrete examples for the case of modular groups of order 2 and 3)@xcite ( for a recent collection of such problems see @xcitethat is very helpful in this context. in this paper we are interested in understanding in more details the set of representation spaces one can study, i.e., the parts of the so - called luna - slices, that are, the representation sets of the components of a given finite dimensional representation space,
we present and analyze the agn feedback efficiencies of energy, momentum and mass in accretion flows irradiated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in large scale cosmological and galaxy merger simulations. the simulations capture the radiation - driven outflows formed from a slowly rotating ( sub - keplerian ) infalling gas under the influence of the central super - eddington ( smbh ) black hole ( bh ). the accretion - luminosity and the outer boundary temperature are self - consistently determined in these models. the radial range of the simulations spans from @xmath0 _ or_-@xmath1 pc and the mass - accretion rate is computed as a function of the surrounding gas density. we find that in models with no hard constraint on the smbh mass, the energy feedback efficiency depends only on the adiabatic index and is independent of the galactocentric radius. when this index is large, a power - law fit to the simulations yields the wrong energy - momentum distribution in the presence of the steeper outer boundary density gradient in the simulations. at the inner radius of the computational domain, ( i.e., close to the bondi radius ), the total energy and momentum fluxes of outflows are similar to those in the non - irradiated models. but at larger radii, such dependence becomes much more severe. the inferred agn accretion rates are orders of magnitude larger than those in simple bondi accretion models. our results suggest that additional additional physical processes are required to explain the observed energy and momenta fluxes in the hd simulations to agree with the predictions from observations. in addition, we note that the effect that agn have on the flow of matter in the galaxy is not negligible and that a detailed measurement of this effect is required to distinguish between agn and galaxy accretion feedbacks.

in this report, we explore the higgs - like excitations, which distinguish from the standard higgs amplitude mode in cold atom system, in the system of spin - down current induced by the spin polarization of the atoms. we demonstrate that the excitations can be viewed as the collective excitations of the system, and determine their microscopic structure through the detection of the spin hall currents. the results can be applied to various systems concerning berry phase, in which the spin up current of the atom is suppressed by the increase of the atomic mass, while the spin down current grows slightly. in the same way, the observation of the so coupling can help to understand the mass generation mechanism in the condensed matter physics and in particle physics. higgs excitations play important role in many areas of physics, such as particle physics, condensed matter and nuclear physics. the standard model of particle physics is the one - particle potential which describes the states particle wave interactions and decay of the gauge bosons. however, the generation of non - abelian gauge potential by interactions between particles is a very challenging task. in many cases, the gauge potential is not suited for constructing so coupling between particles. it is only when the constraint condition is satisfied that the particle physics sector opens up for the exploration of so coupling. during the past few years, there has been great progress in the study of spin up and spin down currents in the ultra - cold and ultra - warm atoms. it has been demonstrated that the formation of so - called spin hall current can be caused by the interactions between the spin operators of cold atom and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite. the observed current is of such nature that it is not only useful for experimentalist, but also has important mathematical and practical applications. the origin of the current is due to the broken symmetry in the bec. thus the current leads to an interesting question : is the current suppressed in the presence of the external magnetic field as compared to the one in the absence of magnetic field? the general answer to this question can be yes, if the system can be prepared in a state of higgs superposition where the spin propagating in the bosonic ground state is uncoupled from the external field, can be put into the extreme limit. unfortunately, current suppression is not always realized in experiments. in experiments, it is usually assumed that the system is prepared in an external environment, where the field is provided by a centrally focused laser field. in most of the applications, the cold atom
many experiments in the literature are currently using large interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors to simulate gw bursts. nevertheless, the detectors already built are close to their foreseen sensitivities, so it is important to consider exchanging data and perform analysis in common. such network data analysis methods are compulsory to separate with a sufficient confidence level real gw signals from noise occurring in one particular detector. this paper studies this problem with monte - carlo simulations. the detection efficiency of the network of interferometers is analyzed with respect to the different noise characteristics : the signal shape, its strength and its location in the sky. such comparisons are based on the ligo network and the 2-km hanford network. a new detection formalism is developed based on matched filtering, similar to the standard method but now with a parameter space containing two more unknowns which correspond to the already existing or planned instruments ; consequently, the data analysis procedure becomes more computationally expensive. however, it is shown that this framework is effective in the case of a non - gaussian noise, as it has been used in previous investigations. the main disadvantage of the current analysis method is that it is not optimized for weak signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ). in this paper, we compare the detection performances of coincident and coherent search methods. we consider two configurations of the interferometer network : 1 ) the configuration where a gw signal is numerically present in each detector at time @xmath0, and 2 ) the alignment of the antenna with the network center of curvature. we find that a coincident search is always better than a coherent search. the advantage of the coincident method is illustrated demonstrating also the robustness of this detection method against a significant loss of efficiency caused by a changing of the arm length of the detectors. + * keywords * : gravitational wave, network, coincident detection, coherent search, overlaps, network measurement, detection efficiency, sky tiling.
we report on a first - principle approach to the engineering of boron - doped armchair nanoribbon transistors, which demonstrates that chemical doping can serve as a way to shape the current - voltage characteristics of such devices. the approach is based on a tight - binding model describing graphene and a proper distribution of charges. in order to reproduce the _ ab initio _ results obtained within the green s function formalism, a self - consistent poisson / schrdinger calculation is performed, to include the effects of an applied gate voltage and of a non - zero drain - source bias on the charge density. the electron - hole asymmetry in the valence band is found to increase with doping concentration and ribbon width, although for the optimal doping level of @xmath0 % the gap is still too small for practical applications. we also find that the mobility gap induced by the impurity has a strong effect on the conductance dip on the electron side, while the same gap is observed in the transistors for different doping concentrations. thus, we predict that the inclusion of chemical entities can lead to a significant improvement in the performances of graphene - based transistors in logic applications. = 1 transport studies in nanofabrication techniques have recently attracted a lot of attention, due to the possibility of engineering so - called ` ` quasi - metallic '' devices @xcite with selectively doped atoms ( or molecules ) within the doping range typically 0.1 % in most cases. in such devices, the number of atoms with a given atomic species is larger than the local number of carbon atoms, leading to large gap opening effects in transistors. several theoretical proposals have been put forward to improve the efficiency of transport studies by including specific chemical entities, such as by deriving an interplay between chemical and electronic excitation states, or by tuning the concentration of such atoms to realize a smaller gap in an otherwise perfectly symmetric conductor. although several of these schemes have received substantial attention ( e.g. the ` ` atom hoppings '' package@xcite ), very recently a new method, based on the use of ionic atoms as electron acceptor, has been proposed to overcome many of the challenges faced by existing transport methods, including the need to incorporate electronic degrees of freedom in the otherwise incoherent band - structure of the considered material ( ` ` band - sheet couplings '' ). this approach rests on the fact that, in graphene and other semiconducting materials, the bands are actually band - gap structures, in which the
in this paper we present inter - comparisons of the oscillation frequencies computed by using nine different oscillation codes : adipls, filou, nosc, losc, graco, oscrox, pulse, posc, lnawenr and jc - d. the comparison has been carried out in order to assess to what extent the choice of the numerical integration scheme ( second - order or richardson - extrapolation ) affects the results obtained for different observational cases. we have structured this study in three parts. in step 1, the comparison of the frequencies from the same adiabatic model ( adipl ) code used in the description of the ionization zones of hydrogen and helium, with the same spherical degree and the same mass distribution, has been performed. two different integration schemes have been tested, for the use of different numerical schemes in the solution of the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium : a fourth - order integration scheme, and a two - order scheme, which gives comparable results for the two lowest ( p- and g - modes ) frequencies, together with a small difference in the high - frequency region ( @xmath0 ). in addition, we have tested the codes using different mesh selections in the radial - mode. the relative differences obtained for the different codes have been analyzed in detail, showing that indeed any possible difference between them is likely to be caused by differences in the physical assumption adopted. step 2 presents the results of the inter - comparison for the values of the large and small separations ( ls ), and the ratio of the rapid variation of the high- and low - frequencies. in all cases the results have been compared using the same mesh selection scheme. using a variant of the m4k code, in which is more consistent with the observational data, the results indicate only that between the two codes lacking a good agreement between them are unlikely to be of the same order or higher. using the nosc code filou ( a 4-byte realt " ), some discrepancies have been found in the comparison between the far - infrared and photometric data, in particular with respect to the relative p - mode fraction. however, the authors of this paper stress that systematic differences can be still the origin of the reported discrepancies, and stress the importance of the codes used to compute p - modes, even if they are below the detection limit.

the charge density wave ( @xmath0 ) in the antiferromagnetic - insulator phase of the called cuprates is investigated by means of a one - dimensional hartree - fock model, which is solved in a completely unrestricted way in the lattice symmetry breaking assumption. after elimination of the symmetry restrictions ( over the space of functions in which the single particle states are searched ) the model is extended to consider the effects of hole doping. it is observed that the hole doping yields a variety of changes in the electronic structure of this material. first, the band spectrum of the material is altered in a way that goes beyond the superconducting dome and reveals a gap beneath the dome. a transition such a transition is now considered to determine the properties of the normal state. the results obtained by employing the most unrestricted possible scheme for the orbitals are presented, which allows for the existence of the pseudogap states in the material. then the parameters of the model are determined in a wide range of hole concentrations, from very weak to strong correlation. for the paramagnetic - metallic state the results indicate the appearance of a quantum phase transition at the doping value below the superconductor dome, which goes from hole - like to electron - like for high doping, and then to metallic state for lower doping. the study of the changes of the fermi surfaces reveals a drastic change in their properties as the doping is increased. the analysis of the hole pairs binding energy as a function of the dielectric constant is performed and it is shown that the essential ingredient of pair binding in the high doping state is spin - space entanglement. finally the results are presented for the solution of the exact many electron problem defined by all the electrons and nuclei constituting a crystalline solid. although the description of such a strongly correlated ground state is not admissible in the present work, a new physical prediction coming from the analysis is the existence not only of doubly degenerate single - particle states, but also of pairs with broken symmetry, which could give rise to the high temperature superconductivity in this material, as suggested by the analysis.
the brightest and most massive galaxies in the present - day universe are the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) in rich galaxy clusters. bcg luminosity and structure, however, do not appear to be strongly related to the x - ray properties of the clusters. both the bcg color and the extent of the envelope are tightly correlated with the spatial - relative velocity dispersion within the cluster. the dispersion in the luminosities of the bcgs about the mean hubble relation, measured by the first studies to use bcg as distance indicators, was typically 0.3 to 0.4 magnitudes. a full sky sample of bcgs in abell clusters over the redshift range @xmath0 is used to extend the bulk - flow analysis on bcg properties to greater distances. the sample includes 433 galaxy clusters with mean heliocentric radial velocities, @xcite, and has a sample of 44 bcgs. surface photometry is provided for all bcgs, based on images from the _ hubble space telescope _ and ground - based instruments. the mean redshifts and velocity dispersions for the galaxy clusters are derived from the full - sky photometry. the projected spatial - spatial - offsets and, in some cases, their projected large - scale structures are well - fitted by power - laws over three orders of magnitude in radius. we find a power - law fit of the type seen in galaxy clusters on small scales, with the points of the sample representative of the brightest bcgs sitting very close to the cluster potential and with the faintest possible extents from the center of the potential measured for the 11 clusters in the sample. these results underscore the need to understand at what mass scale the _ unique _ formation and evolution mechanisms of bcg come into play. if bcg formation traces the current cluster evolution, it may testify to the distinct physical processes between clusters. furthermore, bcg growth is suggested to be driven by cannibalism, in agreement with recent simulations of the formation of the coma cluster.
we present results of detailed @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis calculations in two - dimensional hydrodynamic models of delayed detonations in chandrasekhar - mass wd explosions. we adopted a standard recipe for the formation of the @x0-nuclei from thermal pulses in the material accreted on the exploding white dwarf from a normal companion star. the nuclear evolution was calculated in a post - processing step following the thermal history of the tracer particles. we found a significant production of _ all _ light-@xmath1-seeds from these explosions at the same level compared to solar metallicity. for the first time, we are able to explain the synthesis of almost all @xudd0-isotopes in one scenario. the major problem we face is the very low relative abundance of the true @xuth0-neptunes with respect to the average of all other @xogg0-only nuclei. we identified snia as the important contributor to the production of light-, heavy- and iron - group nuclei in the galaxy. with the inclusion of snia in the analysis we found an important contribution from snia to the nuclear abundances of the light- ( down to the atomic mass number @xog2 ) and heavy- ( up to the chemical mass number 30.3 ) @xggs. we estimated that snia may have contributed to the enrichment of the galaxy more effectively than cold - core nuclei ( ccsne ). in agreement with previous studies, we found that for a given stellar equation of state, snia produce about 60 % of the total amount of light and almost 80 % of heavy @xlds in the solar system. if we assume that our model including snia correctly represents the properties of typical snia with a frequency of 70 % then we can expect that about half of the solar mass due to snia is already synthesized in situ prior to the explosion. therefore, it will be possible to observe isotopes of mo and ru in the spectra of the galactic halo field stars at different metallicities and we will be able to give interesting indications on the details of their nucleosynthetic processes. #
we use cosmological simulations to demonstrate that using lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) as large - scale structure tracers can uniquely constrain the mass distribution of dark matter associated with galaxies, given that damped lyman-@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) are often used as tracers of the galaxy mass distribution. we use the treesph simulations of @xcite to compute the projected autocorrelation @xmath1 between the projected distances of the dlas and 651 resolved galaxies, and find that the amplitude of this cross - correlation is inversely proportional to the fraction of galaxies in the same halo, as predicted by the theory. we show that this method is a self - consistent technique to measure dla halo masses given that the mean of the halo mass distribution is a known quantity in the simulations. specifically, we find that if the galaxies are less ( more ) correlated with the dla than with themselves, this implies that the halos of dlas have a lower mean mass than those of the galaxies, as theoretically expected. this is because in hierarchical galaxy formation models, different dla masses lead to different clustering properties with the galaxies since the galaxies around them. we quantify the bias and the excess variance associated with mass ratios that are introduced in this paper. at the 95 % confidence level, the simulated dla - lbg cross - correlations are 1 %, 2 %, and 5 %, respectively. at a similar level of confidence, the signal - to - noise ratio is 25 %, 90 % and 95 % at the 90 %, which means that at a given the luminosity - weighted mean galaxy mass of a dla is 95 % dependent on the galaxy sample used ( i.e., the mass dependence of the clustering statistics on the level of 25 % confidence ). given that only 10 % of galaxies are randomly selected according to their surface brightness ( sfr ), the statistic can be used to estimate the sfr - normalized mean sfr in a meaningful way. this in turn turns out to be a powerful technique to constrain dwarf galaxy masses, and in particular, it provides a constraint on the mass of the dark matter halos associated with dlas, and thus shed new light on their nature.
we report the discovery of co emission lines at the positions of two @xmath0 galaxies, gn20 and gn20.2a, in the goods - n field. a third, unidentified galaxy is also detected in the 3 mm band, likely to be a distant starburst galaxy. we show that reliable photometric redshifts for bright submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) can be determined from the existing optical photometry, as well as the irac and keck photometry. dust continuum at 3.3 mm ( 0.65 mm rest frame ) is significantly detected for gn20, the first such detection in a distant smg. the ir to ir spectral energy distributions suggest very high luminosities of order 2@xmath1, and significant star formation rates ( sfrs ) of order 10. in addition, the ir and radio seds are slightly colder than those of local galaxies of the same luminosity, confirming the results of p06 for lower redshift objects. the fir and sfr properties and ssfrs of these _ strong _ smgs are similar to those of smgs at lower redstrength, @xfig0. radio and submm stacking of nearly all possible @xcite dropout galaxies, together with the sed fitting of the acs to irac seds, shows that typical @xcited starforming galaxies have much lower ssfra than smgs that live in the same region of sky. we identify the gn20 source with a pair of lockman - break galaxies, leading to a total baryonic mass of 4@xcite. the new evidence for a strong overdensity in this structure comes from mancini et al., who find a plausible optical / near - ir counterpart with a measured spectroscopic redshift ( poisson statistics ), and which also happen to find the corresponding co emission line emission line at the position of gn20. we present a new technique to identify high redshift starburst galaxies using a large sample of _ single_- and _ ensemble_-dropout galaxies selected using the new technique. this approach, which is much less sensitive to spatial clustering than previous techniques, allows us to arrive at the first estimate of the density of high - redshift galaxies in this proto - cluster structure. we conclude that the most luminous and massive galaxies at the center of this cluster are very likely members of a very young starburst, and that they have not had a chance to evolve much further in their evolution. finally, we find that the @
we present self - consistent non - lte radiative transfer calculations for the emission properties of co molecular gas in gas - rich galaxy mergers which include star formation and black hole growth, as well as the effects of galactic - scale winds on molecular line emission from starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ). we merge the results of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium thermodynamics ( sph ) simulations from a three - dimensional ( 3d ) model of a starburst galaxy, a disk galaxy, and a model of an agn interacting with a black hole ( bh ). in all of our models, we include both accreting black holes and massive starbursts as the sink particles for the molecular gas. the black holes are included as sink particles which accrete gas from the surrounding ism. we find that galactic outflows are a natural result of merger - induced star formation along with an embedded agn, and that these winds can entrain molecular gas of order @xmath010@xmath1 - 10#xmath2 which imprints generic signatures in the co morphology and emission line profiles of local galaxies. the influence of winds on these molecular gas properties is quantitatively related to the presence of a bh in the ism : the more massive outflows in our models are seen to be more strongly feedback - driven, in contrast to the less - stressed outflows photoionized by the agn. we discuss the different physical parameter choices for driving winds within the galaxy merger models, and we defer to the choice of a merger - orientation to determine which of these attributes most sensitive to reality. we show that for most of our model mergers, the strength and duration of the outflow depend on the starburst - driven wind feedback energy, and on the merger merging history of the galaxies. consequently, while the higher velocity peaks in co emission seen in _ individual _ galaxies due to agn outflows tend to be associated with galaxies with more intense star formation, the low - velocity emission characteristic of molecular gas traces the contributions from mergers - driven winds in larger systems. we provide an example of our methods by applying them to a model for a star - forming disk galaxy in which the observed co j=1 - 0, ( j=2 - 1 ) emission line emission is entrained by the winds associated with the galaxy s starburst activity, and show that this outflow is well - described by our models and may be detectable in current observations. we also explore other possible mechanisms
we present a monte carlo radiative transfer model of the truebeam linac for use with the penelope radiation transport subroutines. this model is not the actual geometry of thetruebeam machine, but an _ ad hoc _ one created with the purpose of providing monte - carlo users a way to circumvent some of the aforementioned limitations of using the varian distributed phase - space files. for the modeling of the 6 and 10 mv fff beams we use the varians golden beam data set ( gbds ) which consists of an iba ( schwarzenbruck, germany ) cc13 ionization chamber and a iba pfd@xmath0 detector. in this study we have used the variable - velocity domain ( vdvd ) tool of the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) to determine the shape of the visual flattening filters of the clinac 2100 linear accelerator. these filters are designed to absorb the contaminant electrons emitted by the primary collimator and to lie approximately at the position of the standard flattening filter. we have performed simulations with the theoretical input parameters ( effective width, fwhm, aspect ratio and minimum distance from the beam axis ) and the beam parameters ( 6- and 10-fff broad band filters ) to explore the sensitivity of the simulated photon dose profiles to the initial beam parameters of the beam. both depth - dose curves and lateral dose profiles at 5.0 and 10.0 cm of depth have been compared with the initial parameters. it is found that the correct choice of the geometry is very sensitive to the adopted maximum step length ( dsmax ) of the electron source. various modifications of the head assembly components situated above the collimation jaws have also been tested and found to produce similar off - axis absorbed dose distributions. 99 a. petti, r. california, usa., ` ` the true beam linac, '' in _ radiation & biomedical engineering, _ c. f. monroe and r. p. hand, eds.

we present calculations of protoneutron star evolutions using opacities that are calculated consistently from the underlying equation of state of dense matter. this allows us to vary the matter compressibility, symmetry energy, and baryonic specific heats, as well as allow the systematic inclusion of hyperons, a kaon condensate, and/or quark matter. the luminosities and average energies are calculated with the diffusion approximation which is known to provide accurate expressions for the fluxes in terms of energy, temperature-, density-, and composition - dependent diffusion coefficients. we find that the initial stellar mass and the total neutrino emission are sensitive to the details of the convection and entropy effects. we include, for the first time, hyperons and the subsequent addition of convection to the eos. as a result of this study, we never reach the point where the hyperons become a significant part of the total emission, which remains a considerable step away from the actual situation. we also study the effects of varying the neutron star mass, the shape of the kelvin - helmholtz expansion, and the presence of strangeness. in all of these cases, changes in the mass of the progenitor and its expansion speed are induced by varying the treatment of entropy and convection. the most significant of these are as follows : + ( 1 ) the development of a multigroup approach and more exact transport near the stellar surface will be necessary to make detailed predictions for current and future neut -ino detectors. + ( 2 ) to a fair approximation, fermi - dirac with a small effective degeneracy parameter for all flavors of neutrinos will be acceptable. for this reason, we further explore the case of a metastable pns for the gm3 parameterization. the effects on the rapid deleptonization and rapid temperature increase could be explained by a charged - current mean free path that is several times larger than in the calculation. on the other hand, a decrease in central density during the deletonization epoch could happen if the thermal contributions to the pressure at 35 times the nuclear density are significant part the total. we can also compare our pns evolutions to kj for cases in which hyperons appear.
we report on the results of the largest and most detailed cosmological n - body ( p@xmath0- to @xmath1-particle ) radiative transfer simulations ever performed. we solve these simulations on a dell linux cluster on up to 1000 cores, using a monte - carlo approach for a fully non - equilibrium chemistry treatment. we discuss the changes in the computational structure caused by the inclusion of rare, rare sources which are subject to cosmic variance. the most important result of these simulations is the sharp increase in the total number of sources ( by a factor of two at early times ), as well as the evolution of the fraction of the total mass in sources, compared to the well - studied fine mesh case. we also show the existence of large regions, within 100 mpc, where no significant star formation has yet taken place. at these times the particles are gravitationally dominated and are well fit within the short - range approximation used for the smoothing of the diffuse ionizing radiation. the presence of rare sources also changes the geometry of the intergalactic medium, significantly increasing its density and increasing its clumpiness. the cosmic web of structures is the backbone of many astrophysical phenomena. while large scale structure formation accounts for the basic requirements to explain the observed structure of the universe, the modeling of the formation of cosmic web is still one of the most challenging problems of modern astrophysics. it requires a level of sophistication unprecedented in the realm of classical cosmology, a combination of new physics and computer science, which is attracting a growing interest from different fields. the main difficulties stem from the length and time scales of the reionization process, which separates simpler, atomic - gas - dominated structures into larger ones, and the different physical processes which are needed to lead to these larger structures. with the advent of powerful modern computer science tools it is now becoming possible to tackle these problems with unprecedented accuracy and speed, bringing with it the promise of greatly improved astrophysical accuracy.
we present an uniform analysis of all available x - ray data of cygnus x-2 during 7 observations in the period between october 1987 and may 1991. in particular, we compare the timing characteristics of the rapid x- ray variability at a specific position in the z track ( near the soft vertex ) between the different observations to those found in the medium and high intensity levels. we find that the z motion is most likely caused by changes in the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star, which may also cause the variations in the width of the motion through the low - level low - frequency noise. the change in the speed of motion is due to an increase in the overall intensity, not to be related to spectral variations. the g - band count rates increase during the high level and decrease during the medium intensity episodes. we do not find any evidence for spectral cooling and we suggest that the difference in the count rates between the high and low intensity levels is probably caused by an anisotropic scattering process, with most of the flux coming from an emission region which is often hidden from our view by a precessing accretion disk. we discuss possible explanations for the different intensity levels and the phenomenon of spectral hardening. we present the first evidence of spectral anisotropy in the outburst spectrum. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3. _ # 1_#2 _ * # 3 *, # 4 = 0.75 in.25 in for gx 5 - 1 gx 340 + 0, aql x-1 # 2 x_#3@xmath00.1433 and gx 4u 1820 - 30.5 in x - rays binaries : general, stars : individual ( gx ) stars : neutron stars : stellar content stars : oscillations sunyaev - zeldovich, novae, takemi, takemoto, therese, tsukuba, nichols, kuulkers et al.

we propose a new numerical approach for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in three dimensions. the scheme is based on the high - resolution wave propagation scheme of leveque and its 3d extension developed by langseth and leveque. in this approach, the magnetic vector potential is treated as a non - conservative system of conservation laws, and the mhd equations are written as a linearized version of ohm s law. a constrained transport method for this system is then formulated, where the divergence error is caused by the fact that the magnetic field is divergence - free. we discuss several gauge conditions that are necessary to achieve this goal, and we then present the implementation of the new method. the new scheme is designed to be easy to implement, computationally efficient, and scalable. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 a. g. radnaev, y. o. dudin, r. zhao, h. h. jenkins, a. kuzmich, and t. p. grangier, ` ` numerical solution of the initial boundary value problems involving a quasi - neutral two - fluid plasma system in 3 dimensions, '' phys. rev. a * 71 *, 011115 ( 2002 ). j. f. brady, d. b. barnes, and j. c. poon, _ computational electrodynamics : the finite - volume paradigm _ ( academic press, 2003 ). w. s. rossmanith, j. j. lezec, and n. e. cornish, _ introduction to numerical solutions _ ( university science books, 1986 ). d. bouwmeester, j.- w. pan, k. danzmann, m. daniell, and w. r. huffman, _ statistical mechanics of plasmas _ ( springer - verlag, heidelberg, 2009 ). p. krabbendam, p. mosk, f. de sterck, londrillo, and del zanna ` ` macroscopic properties of plasma densities in three - dimensional collapse, '' j. phys. : condens. matter * 38 *, 459 - 463 ( 2003 ) c. pfeiffer and v. shlyapvili ( eds., new york non - dev., 1998 ). s. radunsky, c. jadach, and
we discuss the phenomenon of lopsidedness in disks of spiral galaxies. this is a non - axisymmetric spatial distribution of the surface density of old stars in the inner optical region of the disk. contrary to what is usually assumed, it is not due to radial gravity forces unless it is a strong gravitational perturbation. the atomic hydrogen gas is an ideal tracer for this purpose since it is much simpler to analyze and its spatial distribution is well - defined. furthermore, the hi gas is cheap and metal - poor so makes excellent optical tracers. we apply the above method to the hi maps to obtain the fractional fourier amplitudes and phases for a sample of 18 galaxies in the eridanus group. we find that these two - dimensional maps are compatible with a three - phase structure, with the phase varying with radius and with a minimum offset of @xmath0 from the isophotal centre of mass of the galaxies. from the observed lopsidingness, we obtain a value of the halo virialized fractional amplitude a@xmath1. this value is shown to be a general phenomenon and can be measured easily as a function of radius in a galaxy. it also agrees with a recent fourier - analysis study which showed that nearly one third of the 149 galaxies in this sample exhibit 10 % or more asymmetry in the amplitude of the global m=1 mode. we discuss the implications of the above result for the dynamical processes in galaxies, which are believed to be involved in the fueling of the central active galactic nucleus. further we recommend that the frequent tidal interaction between the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud, or the satellite galaxy accretion, should be regarded as the most important mechanism for the origin of disk lopsoredness. since the orbital angular momentum is decoupled from the tidal interaction, tidal interaction can play a significant role in the evolution of the inner regions of galaxies, especially in the central regions of mergers. thus disks of galaxies are excellent tracers of disks of gas, as long as they contain a gas - rich population.
we present an analysis of _ hst _ wfpc2, _ spitzer _, sdss, _ galex _, and h@xmath0 images and spectroscopy of a complex of five young massive star clusters ( yscc ) in the interacting galaxy arp 24 to study the properties and possible formation scenarios of the yscs. the uv / optical band images ( f300w ) were taken with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on board _ spica _ to derive the ultraviolet and optical light distributions and ages of the clusters, and low - resolution irac / mips images to study their warm dust emissions. we find that the brightest infrared bright knot ( k0 ) is found to be associated with a young ( 100 myr ) massive star cluster ( ycc ) complex located at the intersection of the main uv and optical channels in the galaxy s tidal disk. the other three infrared bright knots ( k1, k2, k3 ) are associated with over - dense star - forming clumps or associations, and are likely to be collections of young yccs or dense clusters of several hundreds parsecs in size. the mass and age of each ycc ( 110 myr and several hundred myr, respectively ) are estimated from the u and i - band images after subtraction of the low - band sources, and the results are compared with stellar population synthesis models. the warm infrared dust emissions ( of the so - called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) and dust continuum emissions ) from the ycc complex turn out to be higher than those from the star clusters surrounding it, and this may be caused by the different dust extinctions in the two systems. the ratio of the pah emission to the dust continuum emission in the @xmath1 2 knots ranges from 1.4 to 9.6 and the ratio is largest in the most ` ` cold '' knots and small ` ` hot '' knots, indicating that the two may not be physically associated with the same physical processes that generate pah molecules. the overall warm infrared colors and isotropic infrared to stellar continuum ratio show a possible trend similar to that of young chaotic star clusters in starburst galaxies.
we discuss the results of three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations of the dynamical evolution of a core - collapse supernova following the explosion of a 15.5@xmath0 progenitor star. the considered model had an explosion energy of @xmath1ergs and the initial ejecta of a hydrogen - rich star. we compared the results obtained in 3d with those obtained in 2d simulations and demonstrate that the propagation of the clumps of various chemical species inside the hydrogen envelope is qualitatively different in the two spatial dimensions. in particular, we find that the asymptotic velocities of metal - rich clumps are much higher in the 3d simulations compared with the corresponding 2d results. this discrepancy can be attributed to 2d/3d differences in the growth rate of perturbations at the composition interfaces, which were pointed out by @xcite. we discuss these discrepancies in the frame of a toy model incorporating only richtmyer - meshkov ( rmi ) instabilities at the helium - rich interface with a spherical geometry. to understand the discrepancies between the 2d and 3d results we propose that the3d models exhibit different hydrodynamical forces and different geometry, which lead to different deceleration laws. we demonstrate that this could be a consequence of the different assumptions on the geometry and the drag forces exerted by the convective zones of the stellar objects within the helium layers. in addition, these differences produce the differences visible in the clump propagation speed as well, which has the further consequence that the fastest rayleigh - taylor fingers get stuck in the massive, helium - shell that forms below the base of hydrogen envelope, and stay comoving with the helium matter there. the latter effect determines the long - time evolution of the explosion, and in the end determines quantitatively the extent of large - scale radial mixing. explosion, supernova, chemical composition, stars : formation, winds, outflows
the detection and tracking of space debris poses a risk to important space - based astrophysical objects such as active and passive satellites. here we explore the utility of a low frequency radio telescope, the murchison widefield array ( mwa ), for observing space debris, with the basic technique described in this paper : reflected radio frequency emissions from the earth that reflect off space debris and are received and imaged at the interferometric array with high angular resolution. the wide field - of - view of the mwa means that large numbers of debris can be simultaneously detected and tracked, for a substantial fraction of the time that they appear above the local horizon. images of the field at different angular resolutions ( e.g. at the lower end of the band ) can provide the right ascension and declination to topically correct the positional information ( or azimuth and elevation ) of the space debris. an extension of this imaging technique to fainter bands such as the fm band allows the detection of up to 10 debris per square kilometre in radius, down to @xmath00.2 m in radiated power, at any given time. we present calculations and tests that show this technique to be feasible, although substantial technical challenges remain. in particular, we show that a standardised radio interferomeric imaging assumption ( that the structure of the object on the sky does not change significantly over its lifetime over the course of its transmission ) can lead to an underestimate of the signal - to - noise ratio ( by many orders of magnitude ), and underestimate the number of received signals. if such an underestimate is realised, then an error - correcting algorithm must be devised to correct these effects. as an example that illustrates the feasibility of this technique, we consider the simple transmitter - receiver configuration in perth, western australia, and show that it can be used as the receiving element of a passive radar system, in conjunction with an active receiver, to generate the necessary 60 mw fm radio power to enable multi - object multi - waveband imaging. we conclude that this primitive passive radar technique can be an important addition to the existing network of radio telescopes, and may prove useful in space debris detection and orbital prediction. however, the technical challenges still remain to be met in order to turn this concept into an operational capability.
i present a new ground - state density functional theory ( gce ) for nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. the gce formulation identifies the nature of _ strictly adiabatic _ relaxations in interacting non - equilibrium tunneling systems of any finite size, for steady - state or open systems, based on a continuum caroli partition scheme. the paper establishes a rigorous gce characterization of the noninteracting thermodynamics and points out that the exact thermodynamics forces for a finite - number of states with or without a thermodynamics excitation are generically conserved exact, variational, and explicitly conservative. i review a number of physical examples and illustrate the utility of the here - presented gce formalism by identifying a set of transport - relevant, exact, universal density functionals. the existence of nonconservative electrostatic forces is shown to be essential for a rigorous implementation of a full gce description of a nonempirical finite - temperature tunneling system. i demonstrate that a proper gce treatment of the thermodynamics grand potential leads to a full recast of the equilibrium conditions provided by the mermin s equilibrium thermodynamic theory. the equilibrium condition of an infinite ratio of ion to electron masses is then equivalent to a nonconservative equilibrium electrostatic force determined by the schrdinger equation and the s - matrix formulation of the electron density functional. i discuss the case of a continuous transition from a landau - ginzburg - landau ( ls ) to a geballe - wilson - fixman ( gw ) equilibrium. the ls collision dft is here formulated as a time - dependent fluctuation - time dependent dft, thus serving as a substitute for the standard mean - field theory ( sm ). the introduction of a truly nonlocal density matrix ( sp ) solution to the electron - electron interaction problem paves the way for an efficient and accurate microscopic description of both the electron dynamics and thermodynamics of interacting nonzero - temperature nanoscale tunneling. as a key application, i demonstrate a proof for the uniqueness of the sp density for a nonzero ratio of the two - electron to ion mass - to - electron mass ratio. a field - theoretic argument is presented that the sp / gce solutions are local in wavevector space and thus qualitatively consistent with gce results obtained by monte carlo simulations. accepting the paper as a supplement to the widely used dbt, a first - order reduction of the error budget for any dynamical estimate for the phase - shift variation of the none
we present a 100 ks _ advanced camera for surveys _ observation of the and clusters, complemented by a high - resolution ovro mapping of the surroundings of the arches cluster. using the six - element owens valley millimeter array, we provide a detailed in - depth study of the high - energy phenomena and processes in these two young stellar clusters and their interplay with the galactic center ( gc ) environment. the main results of our study are as follows. point - like x - ray sources are detected in the core of and, at a detection limit of @xmath0 kev, while numerous diffuse sources are present in the region, best positioned to catch the 6.4-kev emission line from neutral or weakly ionized irons. the spectral properties of the diffuse emission indicate that it is most likely a stellar wind in a colliding wind binary. this interpretation is supported by a simple thermal analysis of the plume, the se extension, and the compact core of the. the x - rays of the cluster regions are characterized by a broad range of spectral characteristics, which can be fit by a combination of a power law with a photon index of 1.92 and a gaussian line with its centroid fixed at6.4 kev. the plasma temperature and iron abundance in the ism of the gc are consistent with that in our own galaxy and other nearby starburst galaxies. the young massive stellar clusters in the central 50 pc region are the best positioned in the image plane to observe the iron enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the presence of super - solar metal ( iron ) abundances. we estimate that the population of ysos emitting in the 0.3 - 8 kev band is at least on the order of 10 % of the bolometric luminosity of the entire gc. the clusters are likely involved in a process of mass accretion in the inner gc, as indicated by the youth of the ionized he - rich clusters. in the cluster region, the late - type wn stars tend to have massive and fast stellar winds, which are responsible for the colliding stellar wind binaries and therefore for the creation of supermassive black holes. we also report the detection of a compact clump of 0.25 pc in the immediate surroundings of. its spectrum shows a strong iron emission line, and we speculate that this could be the emission from a young stellar cluster.
pre - stellar cores are ideal to study the coldest parts of molecular clouds, as they are only illuminated by the interstellar radiation field. here, we compare observations of a pre - stellar core in the cepheus flare molecular cloud, made with ground - based sub - mm telescopes, and space - based far - infrared observations from akari. the total luminosity of the core in our data is @xmath0 l@xmath1. this core iserentially associated with a group of very low luminosity ( vello ) l1148-irs. we find that the distinct morphology at different wavelengths is caused by a temperature gradient across the core, which we interpret as being caused by heating by a nearby bright star. our observations are consistent with the presence of a central temperature gradient, although we can not constrain the source temperature. we detect a high - density inner region, where we find an approximate power - law slope to large radii. this density profile is similar to that used to model the density structure of the l1155 core, indicating that it provides a good description of the dense region at the centre of this core. the akari data are also consistent with an externally - heated, low - luminosity core. we infer that the temperature of the nearby star is in the range 0.5 to 0.6 k.

we measured the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction toward the galactic center ( gc ) region by combining the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) with the irsf / sirius near - infrared photometric system. for the color - magnitude diagram of red giant branch ( rc ) stars, the extinction at 1.2 - 8.0 @xmath0 m was determined by comparing the rc stars in small fields measured by 2mass with those observed in the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ). the difference in the absolute extinction between the two sets of stars is only slightly less than 0.1 %. using the color excess ratios of the rc and upper red giant branches ( rgb ) in the 4-@xmath1 m bandpasses, we determined the total to selective extinction ratio in the irac wavebands as a function of absolute magnitude. the results are in good agreement with previous determinations from the literature, and indicate that the two methods of determining the extinction are independent of each other. in particular, a single extinction law is fitted well by a power law of 0.6, and the slope decreases only slightly toward the center. toward the gc, we found a positive deviation from that power law, and a steep power law toward longer wavelengths. the observed minimum color for the extinction in the near - ultraviolet wavebands is @xcite. that is, the colors of red supergiants in the upper rgb branch are significantly redder than those in the lower rgb branch. this difference is probably a consequence of the different mean distance of the two populations in their distribution along the lines of sight, and of different average positions of their centers of distribution. after correcting for this difference, the remaining uncertainties in the reddening and extinction ratios are in reasonable agreement with the previously determined values. if we assume that the tip of the rgb at the center of our galaxy is at the same distance from us as in the star cluster model ( e.g., *??? * ), and that the foreground extinction is patchy, we can use the integrated light curve of rc stars as an individual star - by - star basis to determine the extinction relative to the total extinction. with this method, we could also measure the ratio of _ reddening _ to _ extinction _ ( ratios of color excesses of rgb stars ), which is one of the quantities we could measure for the first time. in this paper, we also discussed the survey results for the @x
the contraction of the standard simplex in @xmath0-dimensional real euclidean space, consisting of the vectors with positive coordinates, is studied. we begin with a short introduction to contraction under the real hilbert metric and poincare metrics in the right - half complex plane. we then determine the contraction coefficient with respect to these metrics for various classes of complex matrices, and compare them with exact results for translations by positive real numbers, which we prove to be at least as good as those for inversions and dilations by real numbers. far - reaching consequences for complex perron - frobenius theory in higher dimensions are discussed. msc ( 2010 ) : 57r15 ( primary ) ; 57n10, 57m20, 57n15 ( secondary ). [ cols="^,<,^,^ ", ] this paper was meant to be a survey paper on contraction and inversion theory in the real and complex alike. it is written under the hypothesis that a real simplex is a map ( i.e., the set of symmetric matrices ) of positive integers into a contraction of a negative real axis ; the main result is that whenever such a map is a contraction on a strictly positive matrix, one obtains a new contraction measure. the contraction measure plays a central role in many areas of complex analysis and theoretical physics. for instance, in combinatorial analysis, it is useful to understand the relationship between the contraction rate of a matrix and its inversion rate, and the milnor s bound on the proportionality of the transition rates from a non - real matrix to a positive real matrix ( see, e.g., @xcite ). for matrix manipulations, contraction measures are of importance from the dynamical point of view, but also have their origins in the theory of phase transitions, inversion ratios, dilations of fractions, and many others. the study of contraction as a function of an arbitrary real variable was begun by andreasov in the second half of the 18th century, and it was continued by walecka in principle, but it was not until after the 19th century that concretely developed the corresponding contraction measure for the 20th century. the most important contraction measure is the so - called birkhoff coefficient which is the logarithm of the ratio of the real to the imaginary parts of the complex simplex. it was discovered independently by many authors in the papers of ralph and dubois in
we investigate the polarization of h@xmath0 wings that are formed through raman scattering of ultraviolet photons by atomic hydrogen. when an ultraviolet continuum photon with wavelength near the centre of a symbiotic star scatterer scatters, it emits a de - excitation photon in the direction of its ground state, which is subsequently raman scattered into an observer. we assume that the incident o line photon causes the polarization in a cylindrical shell with radius @xmath1 centred on the centre. the wavelength of the incident photon is considered as the resonance wavelength which is a combination of the scattering cross - section and the raman intensity. we consider two cases : one is for a rayleigh scattering process in which the wing is formed by a scattering region consisting of a scattering h atom ( i.e., a cloud ) far from the centre, and the other is a scattering with a receding polar region. since the two scattering components provide opposite senses of polarization, the resultant polarization is obtained by the algebraic sum of the two polarized flux components divided by the total flux. we obtain linear polarization in both cases. in the former case, we obtain polarized wings around the centre and strong polarization at far - wing regions, whereas in the latter case we obtain curved wings. we present a hybrid model of component i consisting of three stratified layers with different h column densities. this model can be viewed as a linear superposition of the solid - angle - weighted sum of previous models with various ratios and homogeneous hydrogen number density. we determine the recession velocity of the polar condensate to be 0.2, which gives a strong linear polarization of wing photons raman - scattered by component ii. we also present the polarization profiles and discuss the possibility of using the polarization to extract information on the structure of the circumstellar matter distribution in order to understand the mass - loss process of the giant component.

the preshower photon multiplicity detector has been proposed as the central element of the alice experiment. the design of the detector is based on a gas based honeycomb proportional counter. the readout system of the preshower detector is designed to study the transverse electromagnetic energy distribution in a high multiplicity environment. several prototypes of the pmd have been fabricated at cern using pion and electron beams at various energies. these experiments will provide evidence for the proposed detector in the near future. the current detector is dedicated to the study of two side effects of the gas. one side effect is sensitive to radial distances of the beam tracks. the other is intended to segment the signal to different locations in the shower. because of the large volume of the cell, the signal from charged hadrons is confined to one cell. this will reduce the occupancy in both preshower and veto applications. optimum values of cell depth and copper wall thickness have been obtained from geant simulation. the presented results are compared with simulation results. it was found that the average preshower cluster size is approximately 5:1 which is close to the requirements for gas detectors. total energy deposition in a preshower is represented by the sum of signals ( adc contents ) of all the affected cells in a shower. the sample used in the current study contains 15 cells. for the extended cathode prototype the average efficiency at the peak pulse height of @xmath0 is estimated to be 75 %. the results of the beta scan show that there is a significant spread in the cell widths. this is attributed to the influence of the anode wire at the wire ends. the end effects have a direct bearing on the efficiency of charge particle detection. two geometries of the cathode cell, with different cathode structures, have been studied. the field configuration within the cell has been optimized using high energy pion beams. the overall efficiency of the design is found to be very low. the proposed pmd is similar to those of preshower detectors used in wa93 and wa98 experiments at the cern sps.
we present the analysis of the faint galaxy population in two very early release observation fields with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) early release camera, vv 29 and ngc 4676. both fields were observed twice, with a total integration time of 26.3 arcmin@xmath0. apsis detects and performs photometry of stars and galaxies in the images using @xmath1 detection limits for point sources in the fwhm of the images, using three different acs filters in the vv29 field and three filters in each field for aperture photometry. we attempt to carefully consider all aspects relevant for faint galaxy counting and photometry, developing methods which are based on public software, and therefore easy to reproduce by other astronomers. using simulations we determine the best @xcite parameters for the detection of faint galaxies in deep hst observations, paying special attention to the issue of deblending. we also investigate the shape of the number counts distribution, and find that it is very sensitive to the choice of the luminosity function parameters. corrections for these effects are important in the sense that a template galaxy of a given luminosity can miss more than half of the light predicted by cww templates, and thus have a different shape than the real galaxies. this effect needs to be taken into account in number count models, and we present detailed analytical expressions for it. after correcting the photometric redshifts for the best possible approximation to the redshift distribution of galaxies, we find that a model with purely secular luminosity evolution is unable to reproduce the observed number counts, despite a number of good fits. a simple prescription where a galaxy is assumed to have formed from a merger of equal mass galaxies of different masses produces a good fit to the data, and is thus a good model for the very faint counts. furthermore, this model requires only the standard aperture and kron - like magnitude limits to be used as ` ` true '' redshift estimators. finally, we present optical photometric catalogs for galaxies in these fields, obtained with the software bentez ( bentez 2000 ). the catalogs are very well reproduced, with slope and normalization similar to those found in the hubble deep fields, and with number counts which are consistent with the results of bentez and can be used to constrain the hierarchical model predictions of nagashima et al. ( 2002 ) for the evolution of the galaxy population.
in this paper, we introduce a new norm, the flux norm, defined as the @xmath0-norm of the potential fluxes of solution spaces of scalar and vectorial divergence form equations with uncorrected partial differential equations. we show that this norm is equivalent to the flux - norm of solutions of and, in the sense that it can be used as a norm to obtain approximation errors which are independent of the regularity and contrast of the coefficients. in addition, for the scalar case, this new norm is related to a new class of inequalities introduced in [ de giorgi, spagnolo, murat, tartar, pankov and many others ( see also related work on g - convergence ) and the so called multiscale finite element method, and can be seen as a numerical generalization of oscillating test functions with the purpose of constructing a numerical ( finite dimensional ) approximation of the ` ` thin '' space of solutions. approximations of are obtained by matching the harmonic change of coordinates of the solution space of to a given elliptic operator. this allows for the assignment of error estimates to particular error estimates for specific elliptic operators. as an application, we consider finite element solutions of discontinuous galerkin processes of and. in this context, for elasticity equations, harmonic coordinates are replaced by divergence - free local harmonically deformed coordinates. this corresponds to a shift of the boundary conditions of the wave function spectrum of the linear program. the approximation errors are determined by the inequalities on the divergence matrix of the corresponding divergence form operator and are controlled by the physical divergence of the divergence form. these inequalities are the analogues of the ones obtained in [ babuka, caloz, osborn, tessellation ( pde ) @xcite and [ sdjhskjdhkjkjkjrgkjhgkjkjstalsdhsdsxkhje ] for ]. we control the non - conforming error associated with any coordinate change for a given partial differential equation by using only the inequalities of this new class. numerical homogenization of these inequalities is then possible by using the new inequalities obtained in the paper as a method to obtain finite dimensional approximation errors by using particular solutions of. the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : rescaledsec ], we recall the previous theorem of kurnal, kurnal and krizhanov ( see theorem [ diverg ] ) obtained by using inequalities on divergence form elliptic problems for arbitrarily rough partial differential
classical probabilistic inference using the measure as a prior over state space can be endow the state space of discrete probability distributions with a metric whose definition is based on the information metric. it is shown that the measurement metric, @xmath0, is a fundamental ingredient of the information theory of quantum states. from this perspective, the global gauge invariance, which requires that the measure yields a measurement outcome which is consistent with the global action, is an elementary feature of the quantum formalism. as such, it is expected that any pair of nearby states measuring the metric simultaneously should yield a probability distribution which is independent of the state from whose perspective the measurement is performed. this is called complementarity. we take the model of measurement simulability, which consists of the general idea that, when performed upon a system in some state, the measurement only yields information about _ half _ of the experimentally - accessible degrees of freedom of the system. hence, performing the measurement brings about the realization of one of two possible events but the observed outcomes _ coarse - grain _ over these events. when two possible outcomes are realized, each of these can be ( with probability ) related to only one of the other possible outcomes. moreover, upon immediate repetition of the measurement, the same outcome is obtained with certainty. the metric is then the determinant of the measure, and the set of possible outcomes is endow with a measure whose probability distribution is determined by the state. this endowingsome formulation of the theory of measurement provides three features : ( i ) the measure simulability and complementarity, ( ii ) measurement realizations that are intrinsic to the system, and ( iii ) measurement one - to - one correspondingly preserving the metric. the three features together yield a novel and powerful hypothesis, which, at this point in the derivation, is recommended by its simplicity and remains to be judged by its utility and accuracy. _ keywords : _ classical probabilism, information theory, quantum theory, measurement, reproducibility, unitary transformations.
we investigate dust growth and settling in protoplanetary disks. as the first step of series of papers, we consider laminar disks in the present paper. we first explain the general property of the spatial and size distribution of floating small grains in a dust layer. using the obtained grain distributions, we examine time - evolution of the disk optical thickness and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths due to dust growth. our results show that, because of rapid dust growth in the inner disk region, the optical thickness of disks becomes less steep than in the outer disk region even though the surface density is proportional to @xmath0 like the minimal mass solar nebula. this effect is due to the difference in the grain size between the inner and outer disk regions. by using the two - layer model in the calculation of the sed, we also examine the evolution of disk structure and seds. in the calculations, we take into account the effect of turbulence on the settling of grains. turbulence is found to have a significant effect on the vertical dust layer structure and the resultant seds are in good agreement with the observed sed fluxes. by combining the results of the model for the dust settling and the simulations, we estimate the disk life time ( i.e., the time that should be taken into account ) and the mass of the central star from different disk models. we show that the observed energy flux at sub - mmimeter wavelengths declines slower than that inferred from sed observations in disks with any disk depletion, although the depletion time is not very large. the observed decline of the energy fluxes is generally consistent with that predicted from the simulations. using our results, we obtain the life time of the disks in terms of the mass and the viscosity of the gas. in those disks where dust growth is relatively rapid, the disk seds should be approximately flat at all times. although the time scale of the depletion occurs at the end of the settling stage, the initial optical thickness should be considerably steeper than the subsequent time scale because of the rapid grain growth.

in this paper, we compile recent multi - band observations of supernova remnants ( snrs ), and compare them with theoretical models. especially recent results are the discovery of x - ray synchrotron filaments in sn1006^@xcite^ by tycho et al.. and the electron - electron interaction in snr g18.8 + 0.3 and the interaction between snr w41/hess 1834 - 087/molecular cloud system. although the nature of electron and ion heating behind the collisionless shocks in snrs remains an open question, we know that at least for energies up to the ` ` knee '' of the cosmic ray spectrum ( @xmath0 ev ) there can exist a population of cold ions that are not affected by the shock passage ghz decay ( the signature of proton acceleration ). thus, it is possible that we have witnessed the ongoing process of electron equilibration during sn explosion, and that the mechanism responsible for this process is related to the accretion of matter from the binary companion star. the observations of snrs enable us to study the relationship between the electron temperature and the shock velocity, which is more than possible. we find that the correlation between this temperature and shock velocity is negative, which indicates that protons and heavier ions are accelerated in the shock. this result is consistent with the theoretical models in which protons are transformed into heavier ions during the process of nucleosynthesis, and the generated magnetic field is larger than the equipartition field at the shock front. we also confirm that magnetic field amplification is the key to get the high - energy electrons to play an important role in the acceleration process. based on our observations, we are able to identify several shock - heated regions ( mmcs ), which are associated with snrs / mcs. using the measurement of the distance to the snr / mc system ( the characteristic size of the shock ), we estimate the total mass of dust in the mcs ( assuming a salpeter imf ). the large amount of dust helps to improve the measurement precision in the distance measurements.

we present @xmath0-band observations of the inner regions of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the european southern observatory s visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ), in a search of giant branch and giant branch stars beyond the main axis. the survey area covers the south - west part of the sgr dsph and the north - eastern part of its halo, making the deepest probe of its stellar population yet made. we find that the population is sharply peaked towards the galactic centre, with stars in the giant branch, on the redward side of the red giant branch tip, and close to the line - of - sight towards the centre. this implies a distance of 24.3 kpc, equating to 31.1 kpc at the nominal distance of the star - forming region. we detect several spectroscopically identified but poorly defined populations in the region studied, including a metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 1.7 dex ) and metal - rich population at solar metallicity, though the latter appears to be heavily contaminated by background active galactic nuclei. we use photometric and spectroscopic redshift estimates to explore the physical extent of the latter, finding it difficult to constrain from the data. the best - isolated group of bulge stars we find is associated with the galaxy s rgb bump, at a redshift of 0.04 mag. its members are most likely to be foreground and it is likely that they are behind the galactic bulge in the colour - magnitude diagram, as seen from the ground - based magnitude of the rgb tip. we measure high - resolution spectra for all 1565 stars in our survey area and combine them with information from the literature to derive a stellar population density and a lower limit for the age of the main stellar population of the galaxy, based on a comparison with co - added stellar luminosities. a single - age population of 2.4 gyr is strongly suggested, while full chemical evolution of its stars is not ruled out. we also find that metallicities vary significantly between the two main stellar populations.

the renormalization group invariance ( rg ) scheme assigns an arbitrary range and an arbitrary systematic error to fixed - order perturbative qcd predictions, and the conventional scale - setting method assigns instead an arbitrary scale- and scheme - dependence to the prediction, even though the prediction is not the correct physical " scale. in this article, we will discuss the necessary self - consistency requirements of the rg, such as reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity, which must be satisfied by a scale -setting method, and we will then show whether the rg based equations which incorporate the scheme parameters, including the gell mann - low ( gm - l ) scheme, combine these features to provide predictions for physical observables at finite order in a systematic and process - independent way. we will also discuss the relative power of the gate special " scale ( pmc ) and pms ( pre - majumdar scale setting ) methods. a detailed discussion about these methods is given, and some examples are discussed. [ cols= " < ", ] in fig. [ fig : pmsfig.sty ], the pmc scale is assigned to the qcd regime ; however, the pms scale is itself scheme - dependent and depends on the quark mass, flavor number, and it is insensitive to the choice of initial scale. thus, it is a _ scheme - independent _ tool for estimating both the scale and the scheme uncertainty. in fact, in order - by - order procedures, it has been argued that the conventional scheme - setting methods, including pmc, fail to satisfy all the necessary requirements for scale and scheme variation, even at the lowest order. in order to understand why is the case, we discuss the rg - invariance so far. in particular, we find that the gm scheme, which is known to be unique in any scheme including dimensional regularization, is not a good approximation for qed observables, which shows the need for a proper scale setting method. the criterion of minimal sensitivity gives specific predictions, which are independent of scheme and scale and can be extended to pqcd predictions. moreover, it provides a natural way for estimating scale uncertainty, which can be used to generate new finite - order predictions. by comparing the prediction with the experimental data, one may then decide which scheme is the correct one for a particular physical observable, say the gluon jet mass. we discuss how to implement these principles in a correct scheme for qcd.
we study the wave - number field of a rayleigh - bnard convection pattern when a temperature difference @xmath0 is applied across a thin layer of fluid. we find that the wave number field is influenced both by the choice of the phase of the pattern and by the competition between the selection by the rolls selected at the center and at the side wall. for a laterally infinite uniform system this competition yields a pattern of parallel, straight rolls. there is no evidence for a radial bias of the wave numbers between the rolls. as a result, the umbilicus displacement varies quasi - statically from small to large values. we determine analytically the local wave numbers of the rolls away from the center where the heating is the most effective. we also present an experiment in which the wave length of a roll is the same as the one selected in the far field. the experiment demonstrates the breakdown of spherical symmetry in a cylindrical pattern. finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the selection of concentric rolls and other effects which have been discussed in the context of similar systems. the rayleigh effect has been the subject of intense research in the last decade. @xcite the effect is characterized by a distribution of rayleigh numbers which arises due to a balance between the effects of positive and negative pressure. one of the most prominent and well studied examples is rayleigh s effect, observed in translucent skin, where the thermal diffusion of a fluid across a surface can lead to diffusive wave - numbers whose directions are determined by the diffusivity of the layer on the one side.@xcite for this effect, a variety of different boundary conditions have been observed. for example, it has been demonstrated that diffusive waves can be selected by varying the viscosity on the surface of a translucent layer with a diffusive slip of the fluid on the other side of the sample.@xmath1 the effect has also been observed in more complex systems, in e.g. convective cells which are embedded in a fluid with diffusive dynamics and which are able to undergo diffusive motions with a relative motion relative to the free - streamer on the side of a tube which is fed with a different type of fluid from the far side. diffusive motion can occur because the fluid is not in equillibrium. diffusion is important in these systems because diffusive diffusion causes the cells to slip and if the selected wave number is larger than the selected one. when a different set of wave numbers is obtained for different @
we investigate time evolution of galactic halo gas ( @xmath0 ) in disk galaxies under moderately strong ram pressure of intergalactic medium ( igm ). we use the latest version of grape ( gravity pipe, grape-7 ) for our studies. we focus mainly on ram pressure stripping and the efficiency of dissipation of halo and disk gas in different environments based on self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations with various parameters. our results mainly suggest that ( i ) even low igm temperature ( 10 k ) can be too high for matter to be dynamically removed from disk galaxies. ( ii ) the presence of disk gas around disk galaxies can suppress the ram pressure stretching of the halo g. in particular, we find that disk galaxies with _ lower _ masses(@xmath1 ) are systematically more gas - rich ( i.e., has more compact distributions ) and has jellyfish - like configurations despite having more massive disk stars. further, the results suggest that truncation of star formation by ram pressure can be more rapid and more efficiently than that by disk gas stripping. namely, our results clearly suggest that as disk galaxies pass through the inner regions of their ism, the amount of gaseous and stellar ejecta accumulated in their inner halos and/or outside - in truncation can be significantly different between late- and early - type galaxies. this implies a different dynamical origin for the cosmic ` ` tracer '' of star - forming halo galaxies. the vast majority of the mass in halo of disk galaxies ( 80 % ) can still be initially accumulated in very dense halos owing to the low densities of their innermost regions. ( iii ) most halo compressed gas can be radiated away from galaxies owing to their high velocity dispersions so that the central excess can be used for fueling the central mbh. we conclude that even in the absence of hot igm in the inner disk regions, disk galaxies and their members can efficiently ram - pressure strip each other. this in turn provides a clue to the origin of red passive spirals.
we present a phenomenological model that seeks to explain abundances of a large number of elements in ultra - metal - poor ( ump ) stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath0. we assume that the first generations of supernovae ( snii ) formed from big bang debris were responsible for the production of la and above. these snii are assumed to be produced in ` ` 3 and 4 events '' for which the abundances in the immediate precursor ism are known ( e.g., ba ). the yield templates of such 3 or 4 events are set by the observational data and not by any theoretical model for production by snii. we show that the la / eu abundance ratio in ump stars is a constant with a mean value of 0.63@xmath10.09 similar to that found by timmes et al. ( 1999 ) for ba in the same star. the @x0-abundance pattern above ba is the same as that in the solar system and confirms earlier results that were based on smaller samples of stars. the new data also support and extend earlier observational results that find that the majority of heavy ( heavy _ eeu _ ) and light ( light _ eu ) elements are produced in snii with a frequency of 3 to 4 events. these results are used to calculate abundances for the sr, y, and zr ( ` ` low '' ) and yn, v, zr, and n nuclei ( _ high _ ) in four mp stars in the sample. these abundances are in general agreement with arlandini et al.s ( 1998 ) results based on the same data. we also suggest that the model has deeper implications for the chemical evolution of the galaxy that was not examined in the previous studies. future observations of ba / fe in the galaxy will provide important information on the nucleosynthetic products of such first generation snii events. the planned observations of cs 22892 - 052 in the hubble deep field will provide additional information on nucleosynthesis by sn ii and should help break the age - metallicity degeneracy that exists in the early galaxy.
we present optimal online algorithms for two interrelated problems involving steiner arborescences that were discussed in separate studies in the past. first, we improve the solution of the continuous one ( @xmath0 ) by adding some directed lines to it in order to solve the discrete one ( discrete problem ). implicitly, this reverse translation improves the upper bound on the competitiveness of any randomized algorithm. even in the case that the number of requests is small, we prove that the resulting algorithm is competitive optimal. second, we give an optimal solution for the symmetric rectilinear steiner angloff - schreiber _ arborescence _ problem. that is, given a set of terminals, connected to the origin, the algorithm knows when exactly one of the following three ( directed ) lines will arrive, and can serve all the requests for as long as it can reach the origin before the new requests for a large number of additional lines. to do this, it is necessary to provide a _ dynamic programming _ description of the algorithm ( algorithm of the adversary ). third, we determine the competitive ratio ( as a function of the network size ) of the online version of the streaming video delivery problem. we show that the optimal algorithm is deterministic and quadratic in the sense that its time complexity can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude. in the simplest case, let us suppose that the origin had a copy of the same movie in a different network node at a different time ( e.g., a movie download, a file transfer, etc. ) and the following contents were stored at some server : a summary page, a receipt for the delivery of a copy to the server, and a summary of the contents of the original movie. the problem was originally introduced by papadimitriu, ramanathan, and rangan @xcite in the context of online multimedia content delivery on line networks. more formally, given an undirected line network, the problem is that of transporting a file over a line of nodes in the network at a cost of a constant number of cost ( in terms of the length of the line ). a common feature of streaming video streaming problem is the tradeoff between the storage and the delivery costs. in this context, efficient algorithms for transporting movies, as well as for online storage and retrieval of movies, are of interest.
we explore stochastic distributions of intrinsic mass to light ( @xmath0 ) ratios for populations of very small stellar masses and ages in the ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) systems recently discovered by carigi & hernandez ( 2008 ). we do this by means of a discrete model for the underlying probabilistic initial mass function ( imf ), constructed by adding to standard imf realizations of single stellar populations, attenuated by an isochrone library. this experiments are designed to test the robustness of stellar population synthesis models, of particular relevance for the inference of total baryonic masses from stellar population studies, and of estimates of stellar ages and metallicities below the solar value [ z]=-3.0 in solar units. we build discrete imf ` ` realizations '' of populations having various total masses, by adopting an assumed age of 10.5 gyr, metallicity of 1+log(@xmath1 ) and a set of imf values between 0 and 2.0, and a range of total ages of 0.5 and 2 gyr. these results are compared with available estimates of total stellar masses in the local and higher galactic scales. we find that as the total mass of the stellar population is increased, the intrinsic variance due to the inherent variance of the imf is reduced, and goes to a very low value, at least partially, in populations with old ages. in such systems, even for stellar populations whose total mass is of order of a few thousand stellar masses, the dispersions of more than 1 are expected. we also find a tendency for the values of intrinsic m / l, derived for these populations to increase with increasing total stellar mass. although more data are needed to pin down the exact range of intrinsic variance in individual populations, we expect that at least part of it can be related to the apparent increase in abundance ratios observed for the local dwarfs. galaxies : stellar content galaxies : dwarf open clusters : general galaxies : formation methods : statistical
in this work we present the first study of the persistent ( = non - burst ) emission of the magnetar 1e1547.0 - 5408 over a period of 27 months, starting with the onset of an outburst in october 2008, covering the epoch of the jan. 22, 2009 outburst, and ending two years later in january 2011. making use of the imaging capabilities of integral isgri, jem - x and swift xrt, we derived the spectral evolution of the total emission over the broad energy range 1300 kev starting 2 days after the antinodal peak in the mass spectrum ( @xmath0 960@xmath1 at 50 kev ), the total pulsed spectrum over the energy range 2.5 - 150 kev, and the pulse profile evolution between oct. 3, 2008 till dec. 25, 2010. we found a transient non - thermal component that gradually fades to undetectability over the 27 month period, triggering a timing glitch in the same time. the main results of this work are : 1 ) for the first time the pulse frequency evolution below 10 kev was derived, showing that the power - law component dominated by the soft component during the early part of the outburst can be satisfactorily described in terms of a combination of the thermal photon emission from the innermost magnetosphere, plus the emission from an emission - dominated flux - distribution in the magnetospheric shell. indeed, the two components show very different spectral behaviours when compared in the soft and hard x - ray bands. 2 ) in the tail of the upper - energy 2009 outburst a rapid decay in the total flux followed by a slowly decaying exponential component, clearly detected in the 0.7 - 114 kev energy band ; 3 ) the eccentricity amplitude of the dipole component in the spectrum has been compared to the canonical value, and found to be a factor of 2 smaller. pulsations were detected for energies up to 70 kev ; and the total, time - averaged 0. 7 - 109 kev spectrum was discussed. finally, we identified a new transient high - energy pulse that begins to show up in the time window of about 15 months after the beginning of the upturn in jan. 2011, and continues to decrease in strength until the end of jan. 2013.

in this review i highlight some of the exciting developments in studies of galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) that are being produced on both the present and the future frontiers of the field. the massive observatories, chandra and spitzer, together with the new generation of ground based spectrographs, are playing a starring role in our collective efforts to push the frontiers on the properties of distant galaxies. complementary to studies of field galaxies are programs on clusters like at this meeting, where strongly synergistic may be a more appropriate characterization. the ability to do both extraordinarily detailed ` ` archaeological '' studies of nearby galaxies at one epoch, combined with the great observatories are beginning to provide the needed benchmark. a particular example is given of how observations at high and low redshift combine to challenge our view of the nature of galaxy evolution. at this conference i highlighted several of the studies that are currently underway or are being developed. in particular, i highlighted the importance of deep hst observations of the wfpc2 hubble deep field ( hdf ), which is one of the two key ensembles with which to study the highest redshift galaxies. the hst acs datasets now allow detailed studies in multiple filters ( at 1350 ) at unprecedented depths ( reaching 1.5@xmath1 ). the deep x - ray data from the caltech sub mm telescope are being used to determine galaxy rest frame uv luminosity function, stellar and dynamical mass distributions, luminosity density and evolution, star formation rate evolution, mass buildup, agn role, etc. another topic of critical interest is assessing the present state of star - formation in galaxies as compared to a simple ` ` desert '' scenario. the observed star formation rates appear to be approximately constant in time ( within factors of a few ). most of the star forming galaxies are spheroids, with only a small fraction of bulges and ellipticals. galaxy stellar masses are derived from early spitzer irac observations ( barmby et al. ). this review attempts to give a self - consistent assessment of the state of affairs, given the wealth of new and compelling data that is now available. finally, it is concluded that with the advent of the hdfs and hdf ps, it will soon be possible for us to ` ` watch galaxies form and grow ''.
we prove that the periodic flat plane problem is stable under randomization in the bounded model ". in the density model ", the problem is analogous to m. gromov s well known models for adding relators at random to a finitely generated group ( more precisely, analogs of the few relator model " of @xcite ). we also show, under suitable assumptions, that the random group produces _ infinitesimal perturbations _ of the deterministic data. periodic flat planes ( as it is called in the literature ) are conjectured to exist whenever some finite index subgroup of a discrete group @xmath0 admits an infinite abelian quotient. the proof of the theorem is usually based on analysis of the data itself and, sometimes, it is used to establish the group properties ( if any ). although the theory of random groups is very well developed, no rigorous tests have been published. in other words, one has to rely on the phenomenological properties of the random groups ( which indeed are central to the construction of the moduli - topology model ). the problem of finding _ periodic _ flat planes is analogous ( in a sense, in many dimensions ) to that of computing _ finite _ index subgroups in the context of a laplace - bernoulli theory. this is basically a problem of _ choosing the best k - space among a large number of possible ones. recently, some interesting results have been achieved in this area ( for instance, adding hyperbolic groups to a non - archimedean local field ), by using the techniques of modularity. in particular, it was shown that if an ensemble of cat(0 ) groups acts properly ( i.e., uniformly ) on a class of 2-complexes of genus at least 1, then every copy of the ensemble contains a flat plane between the two finest groups. more precisely : if a group acts accurately, consistently, on each of the complexes, then it is stable. if the group does nt act properly ( and we will not discuss here whether this is a good possibility in the general case, because the numerical results are very hard to compute ), then at some point the group must _ jump _ to a higher rank subgroup, and the jump will be _ exponentially occuring _ in the lower - dimensional case. the key moment in the process of this jump occurs along a well - known sequence of covering maps, and it is the case that the group is constant in the sense that the
in this paper, we propose a multiscale persistent function for protein structure characterization and conformation entropy evaluation. it is based on two major methods, i.e., persistent homology and flexibility rigidity index ( fri ). persistence homology provides a topology based model where the protein contribution can be subdivided into protein contribution and topological entropy provides a bridge between topological and geometrical entropy. by the same token, it allows to incorporate a continuous version of rigidity function into the representation. further, it provides a consistent description of protein structure and allows the quantification of conformation entropies. an optimization method for the distribution of torsional angles is proposed, where highly regular " structure elements are naturally classified in to @xmath0 clusters with irregular boundaries. in this way, it achieves an optimized classification and a high silhouette value, indicating very good quality of clustering. even thought biomolecular conformation energy is a key property to understand a wide variety of physical, chemical, and biochemical phenomena, its evaluation or calculation is very challenging both experimentally and theoretically. recently, a k - mean clustering method for structure evaluation has been proposed, which offers a good description of structure in terms of degree distributions. particularly, backbone dihedral angles and side chain rotamers are the most widely used structural measure for protein conformational entropy. dihedral angle based parameterization usually involves a discretization of angle distributions and it is found that the entropy values are sensitive to the grid size. more interestingly, based on the persistent analysis, a protein structure index ( psi ) is proposed to describe the regularity " of protein structures. simply speaking, for a highly regular structure element, its dihedral and bond angles are very consistent thus contribute very little to the total entropy. through the entropy evaluation, psi is able to provide a new way of structure regularity characterization. it counters the hydrophobic effect favoring the folded state and in part explains the marginal stability of most globular proteins.

we discuss the many - body problem for mixtures of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms in optical lattices for a wide range of filling factors and interaction strengths. we focus on the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in the case where the interaction between the bosonic atoms is multi - orbital, while the fermions are bosonic. we use the standard single - band hubbard model, which describes only the lowest single - particle band of the interacting system, to obtain the solution of the lattice problem and show that despite its simplicity it already includes higher - band and bond - charge off - site processes. in particular, the occupation - number - dependent on - site energy of the bosons can already be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in comparison with the conventional tunneling. we develop a general method to calculate the ground state of the system and obtain the corresponding phase diagrams. the resulting phase diagrams are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental observations. we also discuss an extension of the standard model in which the multi - orbitally renormalized pair tunneling is strongly suppressed and the effective inclusion of higher bands is shown to provide an important improvement in the predicted phase diagram. an important feature of this extended model is that it is explicitly occupation - dependent in the low - band, i.e., the contribution of the bose - fermi - hubbard interaction is smaller than the conventional one. this leads to a strong shift of the mott lobe boundary and a strong impact on the transition diagram. interacting bosons are the subject of intense research in many fields of condensed matter physics. the short - range interactions between bosons play an important role in determining the properties of liquid helium and atomic gases, as well understood in terms of bose theories ( see @xcite and references therein ). the interactions have also been proposed to play a major role in driving the evolution of the crystal phase diagram in the strong - coupling regime, in particular in relation to the formation of lattice crystals. the recent experimental progresses in trapping cold atomic gases have allowed experimentalists to access regions of the phase diagram far from equilibrium, where the effective hamiltonian for bosons is incomplete. it has been demonstrated, therefore, that several quantum gas phases, which are difficult to realize in equilibrium, can be achieved experimentally, and in most cases the relevant energy levels and phases of these phases are well described by simple effective models. the investigation of such phases is of great importance for the experimental understanding
we have used the vla to investigate a sample of 43 low surface brightness galaxies which are suspected of deviating from the taylor - fisher relation ( tf relation ). twenty two of the galaxies appear to have rotational velocities in the range 80 - 200 km s@xmath1, or small ellipticals with scale lengths @xmath2 kpc. the remaining two appear to be normal - size disk galaxies with blue colors and blue absolute magnitudes. in the field of the 43 hi - detected lsb galaxies, we detect five dwarfs ( p01 - 1 and c04 - 2 ) and three giant disk galaxies ( -ngc 7631, -ugc 2318 + 078 and -gc 12535 ). the first detection is much less sensitive to rotational velocity than the second and the third detection is probably caused by contamination by bright galaxies. after removing contamination from the four detected dwarfs, we find two lsbs and one giant lsobe. all five of the lsbs show large internal scatter in their hi spectra, which we take as evidence that they have low total mass and that the potentials are dominated by dark matter. for the 43 lsbs without contamination, we obtain a slightly larger scatter in the tf relation than has been found in previous studies. this further suggests that the contamination comes from larger ( i.e. larger than the draco depth ) dark matter potentials. if this is the case, there is a fine tuning between the total mass - to - light ratio and the central surface brightness of the galaxy, and it requires that the baryonic mass fraction in disk galaxy potentials be nearly constant at all times and then has the correct star formation history to produce the right amount of light for a given luminosity.
we study the treatment of trends in economic time series. trends are defined as persistent deviations from a given trend, that is, changes in the trend over a period of time. univariate models of time series are usually used to determine stochastic trends, which means that conventional confidence intervals are not valid and hypothesis tests can not be conducted as usual. in particular, the most commonly used test statistic for determining trends, the t - statistic, is not appropriate for the situation we consider. in this study, we focus on the vector autoregression ( var ) model, in which lagged values of two or more variables are used to forecast their future values. we show that the var model has no predictive content. a var(@xmath0 ) model is a set of @xmath130 time - series regressions in which the future behavior of one variable is determined by the lags of the other variables. our analysis shows that, using this model, it is possible to predict not only the position of a variable in the future but also the values of its lags. this is useful for the purposes of forecasting individual variables, as there is no formal equivalence between an univariate model and a conventional ols - based statistical inferences. also, as we shall see, a var has a nonzero finite fourth moment. prediction of trends using the var is not only a novelty, but can also be misleading, especially if the variables are nonstationary. it is therefore crucial to understand the error analysis on the basis of the var. we also introduce a method to estimate the shape of the future lags using a bayes - type estimator. predicting trends using bayes methods is again a novelty. a method for evaluating trends is introduced using a ganger - taylor ( gct ) method. we prove that the trend of a particular variable is stationary if and only if the time series lags are zero. the method can be used to check the validity of hypotheses about a variable using any existing hypothesis test and, in fact, it has proven to be useful in the context of economics.
the rosat pspc data of psr 0656 + 14 have been analysed in the framework of a simple model for the source temperature distribution and the geometrical configuration derived from the radio data. the results of the analysis indicate that the soft x ray emission is dominated by two components, i.e. by a ` ` soft '' component with a temperature of @xmath0@xmath1 and by a harder component, either a power law or a steep power law, with the temperature of the soft component increasing with the distance from the stellar radius. the observed degree of modulation can be attributed to the anisotropic thermal cooling induced by the crustal, dipolar magnetic field and the geometric anisotropy of the emission region. the best fit power law index of 1.07 ( for 74 dof ) is similar to that derived for psr 105552, suggesting that both components of their emission are of magnetospheric origin. the slope of the hard tail is consistent with that predicted for the simple model given by finley et al. ( 1992 ), although suggested by them for a non - thermal origin. a model of a superposition of two blackbodies reproduces the best available data on the pulsed fraction, which is in the range [ 810 % ]. based on the above model, we have simulated various light curves using the rosat 0.12.4 kev light curve to that computed with the values of reference shown in the column of central column. the resulting light curves are inconsistent with the observations only if the inclination angle of the source is significantly larger than the one proposed by lyne & manchester ( 1988 ). our model, in which the polar caps are assumed to give the observed modulation, can not reproduce the high degree of modulus even for the very low value of the dipole inclination angle. on the basis of the new observational results, the paper carries out an analysis similar to the one presented by page ( 1995a ) and explores the effect of polar cap emission on the x ray light curves and spectra.
we give a brief introduction to the information - firing - quotient ( @xmath0 ), which measures the ratio between the information transmitted by a neuron and the firing rate carried by spike - trains and their firing rate. we discuss the main characteristics of this quotient and its relation to information transmission rate for two kinds of information sources, namely bernoulli and markov processes. we introduce the ` ` jumping '' parameter, which is defined as the combination of transition probabilities from no - spike - state ( at high information cost ) to spikes - state at high energy cost. we show that for low values of jumping parameter the quotient of information and firing rates is a monotonically decreasing function of firing rate, thus there is straightforward one - to - one correspondence between temporal and rate codes. on the contrary, it turns out that for large enough jumping parameterthis quotient is non - monotonic function of spike - count ( or energy ) and it exhibits well pronounced global maximum. thus, in this case the optimal firing rate exists. furthermore, we observe that information transmission is more optimal in the sense of information amount transmitted at the cost of unit energy. address = department of mathematics, imperial college london, london sw7 2az, united kingdom address = school of mathematical sciences, university of vienna, oskar - morgensternwarte, premiers street, skopje, premier, scotland address = joint institute for nuclear research, al. acad. sci., b. cheremushkinskaya, 25, 30 - 059 cracow, poland the information theory and methods of information theory have had a long and successful history in neuroscience. in particular, there are many natural sciences, including information theory, statistical mechanics, probability theory, non - linear stochastic dynamics, information transfer and many others @xcite. the main idea of this article is to shed a new light on the information transmission process in terms of the information cost. to this end, we study the binary information source, namely information coming from an unknown source and output signals which are represented by sequences of symbols. each message is represented by a finite number of symbols and each spike - sequence is built of such symbols. we believe that such information source will be more useful in the description of the neuronal information processing in the mode of information transmission. for a given information source the information transfer is governed by an uncorrelated markov process. we also show that the asymptotic equip

we present a theory of phase - space hole dynamics based on the berk - breizman model. a numerical investigation of the period of chirping bursts in the confined vlasov plasma is performed, by means of a two - dimensional axisymmetric phase diagram and a nonlinear theory of the long - time nonlinear evolution. we found nonlinear instabilities in both subcritical ( linearly ) and barely unstable ( barely unstable ) regimes. the existence of multiple resonances, resulting in growth of macro - scale structures, was verified numerically. the bifurcations between steady - state, periodic, and steady hole solutions are well matched by analytic theory. we also explain the mechanism of formation of super - critical solutions, by landau damping, whose growth rate can be positive if the amplitude is damped when @xmath0, while it is super - negative if this parameter is zero. the proposed theory is also applied to explain the persistent growth of phasestrophy and wave energy in the bb case, which we conjecture may be relevant for the traveling wave tube quasilinear experiment., is of fundamental interest in understanding nonlinear dynamical instability in confined systems. it is responsible for the observation of a wide variety of observed phenomena, such as the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of plasma over a broad range of length scales @xcite, the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) divergence in plasma thinning and transition - layer transition ( tae ) of a polar collider near its eddington limit @xcire, and the bistable growth and stabilizing behaviour of plasmonic systems in the tae experiment at cern. a fundamental source of nonlinearities in plasmas is the resonant effects, which are due to the interaction of an energetic particle with an electrostatic wave propagating on a resonant surface. these effects have been studied theoretically by using numerical simulations of collisionless plasma, and have been experimentally confirmed in a number of systems. the nonlinear response of a single wave to a small perturbation is obtained by following the evolution of its wave number and the time - scale of its decline from a collisionless initial state to the system is determined by tuning the parameters of the model. in particular, scaling laws similar to those of linear theory have been derived numerically for the case of krook collisions. the linear theory provides a good description of stationary and dynamical equilibrium states
we introduce a concept called confidence and use it to compare detection devices based on single - photon sensitivity detectors and detector cascades. the concept of the confidence allows us to quantify the reliability of a state preparation process based on a measurement with a single photon. we calculate the confidence of state preparation using a state which is a so - called projection operator valued measure ( povm ). as an example, we compare detector cascading with a detector with a unit - efficiency of 0.73. in the context of real - life applications, cascading can be viewed as a method to boost the efficiency of a detector detection device by a factor of a few compared to a full detector. it is a concept which has been around for a long time in quantum information science. the basic idea is that in order to be able to perform a useful measurement we need to have both a good measurement and a good description of the _ preparation process _, i.e., a description of how the detector might perform. state preparation is one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, and has been studied in a wide range of fields, ranging from condensed matter physics @xcite ( for a comprehensive review see ref.@xcite ), to quantum information and quantum computing @xcitethat usually involves the use of entangled states. preparing states with more than one input mode is usually considered to be a computationally difficult task. however, when only a single mode is available, the system can be prepared using an ensemble of detectors. this is commonly referred to as a _ detector cascade_. a detector cascade is a device that is designed to perform this task when the resources are available. it consists of a set of spatially separated modes of the electro - magnetic field, which are correlated in a cascade, such that initially one photon is in each mode. the main goal of this paper is to study how the cascading detector behaves as a detector. we use the confidence to compare different detection devices. in optical applications, for instance, wave - packets of single photons are often needed. most detectors can not detect single photons, although they can distinguish between a few and many photons. in this paper we show that there are several types of detectors which can be used as detectors. we introduce a new concept called _ confidence _ that quantifies the degree of confidence in the outcome of a measurement, that is, the probability that the _ prepared _ state passes a projective test for the _ expected _ state in a single - shot experiment. the significance of
we calculate the time evolution of the emission lines from sn 1987a using a model for the ejecta with non - thermal ionization, with all atomic and molecular processes included. this allows us to take into account the uv - field, temperature and ionization of the helium - rich ejecta, as well as the effects of dust absorption. in a series of papers li, mccray & xu, with coworkers, we have shown that many important emission lines have strong contributions from several abundance zones, and the emission may in fact be dominated by zones where only a small fraction of the mass of the liquid helium resides. examples of such lines include the [ o i ] @xmath0 m, [ fe ii ] l, and [ ca ii ] m lines, for which the emission from a given zone is dominated by more than one emission zone. in this paper we apply the method previously developed by shigeyama, nomoto & hashimoto ( 1989, 1993 ) for the calculation of the line profiles of the fe ii lines, and apply it to the case of the hydrogen lines. in paper i we computed the hydrogen density distribution, using a simplified, time - dependent model. here we consider a more realistic setting, and assume that at early times the line profile is easy to interpret. we find that the temperature of the different abundance regions is significantly altered by the mixing of hydrogen with oxygen, and that the filling factor of the core is reduced. due to this we have to assume a lower helium abundance. we also calculate the absorption of the cv gamma - rays by hydrogen. this is done by first allowing for partial photodissociation, and then including all the absorption features from the he i zone in the calculation. with this method we are able to calculate the total spectra of the lines at different stages of the evolution, and we compare the results with observations. in particular, we find the ca ii]@xmath1 m lines at the earliest stages are particularly interesting, because they are the most strongly affected by the hydrogen - rich zone. overall, we conclude that at least in the context of type i supernovae the most important lines are those arising from the most metal - rich regions. # 1#2#3#4 # 1.25 in.125 in.25 in
we present a spectral analysis of the most recent observations of the hard x - ray emission from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ngc 7469, in which an iron k@xmath0 line and a reflection hump are observed to be produced by comptonization of soft ( 2 - 10 kev ) uv photons. we find that the observed iron line is consistent with an iron equivalent width ( @xmath1 ), while the reflection component can be fit with a gaussian with a power law spectrum ( power law without high energy cutoff ). we interpret this spectrum as reprocessing of the uv / soft x - rays, with the illuminating medium ( comptonizing medium ) consisting of a face - on slab subtracted from the optically thick part of the spectrum. we fit the reflection hump with a model consisting of an absorbed power law ( also observed in the optical / uv ), a comptonized reflection hump, and an iron line from compton downscattering. the spectral data are consistent with no significant change in the hardness of the reflected component over the observation period, which allows us to determine with confidence that the reflection is from isotropic matter. the continuum flux is strongly correlated with the x / euv flux, with a zero - lag relationship of 0.46. we suggest that the iron line and reflection hump arise from optically - thick or co - illuminated regions in the inner accretion disk, respectively, and that the fluorescent iron emission is produced in the flaring regions above the disk. the luminosity of the primary emission mechanism, inferred from the earlier ` ` big blue bump '' ( bbb ) and the current data quality, support this interpretation. we also present a detailed study of the time variability of the spectral properties, finding that although the variations in the spectral index and fluxes are not strongly correlated, there is a correlation between them. this correlation may be due to a combination of statistical and systematic errors in the determination of the disk inclination, which is certainly consistent with the data, and may help to explain the observed state changes of the accretion rate in the agn where these types of models are no longer viable.
we compute the density wave spectra of electron and hole fermions in the ultrathin cuprate superconductors over a wide range of doping and superconducting order parameters, focusing on the region near the antinodes where the fermi surface intersects the magnetic brillouin zone. based on recent experimental and theoretical work, we show that the quasiparticle spectrum in the presence of bond order fluctuations is well - described by a fully isotropic, bond - density - wave ( bdw ) model. in this model we include both short - range incommensurate and long - range bond order correlations, and investigate their impact on the electronic spectra. we find that for correlation lengths of the order a few lattice spacings, as seen in experiment, the effect on the spectral function is negligible in the low temperature regime. however, we see evidence for an increase in the arc - like feature in the frequency of electron pocket oscillations with doping, which is in reasonable agreement with recent experiments. the recent discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity in underdoped cuprates @xcite has triggered a huge amount of activity from basic and applied research, with potential applications to the field of high - energy physics. despite its high experimental importance, the cuprates pose a challenge to our understanding of correlated many - body quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the strong coupling regime, particularly in light of the spectacular phenomena exhibited by the tunneling spectroscopy ( tcd ) experiment on ybacuo@xcite. despite much effort by the experimental community, there are still many open questions regarding the nature of the experimental observations. of particular interest are the details of the so - called arcs seen in the electron photoproduction experiments on the antiferromagnetic side of the bacchetta - ovchinnikov test - mass spectrometer ( ovch ) on the @xmath1-axis ( the kosterlitz - thouless - weiss process ), the latter being one of the simplest qed setups exhibiting quantum oscillations. the arc phenomenology consists of two main features : ( 1 ) closed electron pockets, each with a finite area, and ( 2 ) regions of well - defined excitations associated with the closure of the electron pockets. as temperature is tuned, the size of the larger area increases and the electron pocket number as a function of the temperature becomes larger, eventually collapsing at low temperatures. due to the latter
the problem of determining the motion of a structureless particle in the gravitational field of a massive black hole is a center piece of general relativity from the point of view of a slowly moving body in a weak gravitational field. the problem itself can be calculated perturbatively as an expansion about flat spacetime, but the same technique is employed to find the green s functions of these bodies and compute their respective self - forces. here we present an extension of this method to a weak - field regime where the motion is geodesic. the main effect that is changed is that the particle experiences a sudden change of behavior that is entirely due to the gravitational perturbation creating the self - force. as the curvature of the space - time in the vicinity of the particle increases, the particle is subject to an increasing radiation - reaction force. the magnitude of this force decreases with the increasing mass of the black hole, and as a result the particle makes a diagonal crossing over the event horizon at a rate that is comparable to the rate at which gravitational waves will be emitted by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ). the calculation of the electromagnetic green s function for such a particle requires, in addition to the usual analytic solution of the post - newtonian equations of motion, a new scheme based on solving for generic orbits around a kerr black hole in the eulerian framework. this scheme is shown to reproduce the exact result for the scalar charge for a particle with four - velocity in the background spacetime ( @xmath0 ) ; it is then reasonable to suppose that the scattering cross section of the charged particle is quite large compared to the rest - over this region of spacetime. the gravitational self - forcing from this new scheme is compared with the usual derivation in terms of self - interactions involving a carter constant. we find that the new method produces an excellent agreement with the results from numerical calculations by quinn and wald @xcite, and we reproduce the latter result to a reasonable accuracy. # 1#2#3#1@xmath1#2
we describe the electronic properties of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) graphene flake in the presence of a 1d kaluza - pitaevskii ( kp ) potential. our main result is a detailed analysis of the dispersion relation and the transmission through a @xmath0-function barrier. we find that for sufficiently high barriers the kp potential induces a collimation effect which is more favorable than the usual single - kp wave - function one. this comes at the price of a linear energy spectrum in the transverse direction, which is linear near the k point, but has a reduced velocity. the results are found to be consistent with those obtained for a fabry - perot interferometer and a superlattice of graphene. in recent years, we have seen a series of remarkable experiments @xcite reporting on the tunability of transport properties of 2d metallic systems by the manipulation of the electronic structure of nanostructures. our goal was to develop methods for controlling the size, shape, and uniform conductivity of structures with periodic or quasi - periodic boundaries ; to do so we are interested in systems which could be viewed as the microscopic counterpart of the 2d kp regime, i.e. structures in which the electron wave function is a superposition of the conduction and valence bands. for these systems it is natural to think of periodic boundaries as the latter being the result of an interplay between the inter - layer interactions of the valence and conduction bands. well known examples are the periodic conductance and conductance at the kavli institute for 1d and 2d fermions respectively, and the conductance of graphene and of superconductors such as znv@xcite and uv - raman@xciteth@xmath1. however, it is still the case that, in addition to the two periodic structures, there are also a number of periodic structures which are weakly tunneling and for which it is not possible to control the width, length, and period of the barriers in a systematic way. one such periodicity is the so - called k - point, predicted for 2d metals by reynolds - perel theory. it was first realized by lee - wilczek in the 1920s for the first time by haldane s theory of the tunneling through a periodic potential, which was later realized experimentally in experiments with fermionic atoms, ions, atoms, and electrons @xc
newtonian mechanics is our first comprehensive model of a fundamental particle dynamics. it is based on quantum concepts each of which may be very different from its classical counterpart, if there is at all a counterpart. the coset for the space - time is given by the quotient of the galilei group @xmath0 which is an abstraction necessary for the analysis in a physical theory with precision. the formulation of such intuitive concepts into the concepts of classical physics is what physicists are familiar with, but not at all _ a priori _ more intuitive than their quantum counterparts. the unfortunate common miss - statement of quantum physics being less than intuitive has hindered our appreciation of quantum mechanics with the more appropriate quantum formulation of the fundamental conceptual notions. we present here a model of the physical space as behind simple quantum mechanics and illustrate its having the correct classical limit. more generally, one should consider such quantities as having values modeled by some appropriate types of abstract algebraic entities. the system of real numbers as one of the latter has no preferred role apart from being our first order approximation to the physical nature as in the classical theory. the main culprit for the limitation of the classical concept is the real number, which the philosopher w. quine once called a ` convenient fiction'; with quantum physics, the old fiction is not so convenient any more. let us focus on the notion of the quantum space as a collection of all possible positions, either of a free particle or equivalently as the center of mass for a system of particles. the first mathematical model for the mathematical model is provided by the three dimensional euclidean geometry, which had been the only available model for centuries till newton s time. we are now familiar with the einstein models, for his theories of special and general relativity. of course, the newtonian model can not be the same as the classical one. we want to look at quantum models. a simple natural guess based on modern mathematics would be a kind of topological space which has some noncommutative geometry. the idea of quantum geometry is not new in the subject matter related to deep microscopic structure of spacetime and quantum gravity. but it is the main ingredient of any successful quantum model.
we present a comprehensive determination of the evolution of the luminosity function at @xmath0 from deep, wide - area near - ir observations of the early universe obtained with the wide field camera 3 and wfc3/ir on the hubble space telescope. by combining these new observations with all available high - resolution goods, candels, uds, ers, and borg programs, we make a comprehensive catalog of 100@xmath1 candidates over 5 independent pointings on the sky that are not directly selected in these fields. the full catalog includes all the schechter parameters ( as well as nonremovable physical parameters such as intrinsic velocity, spectral types, colors, and luminosities ) from the available archival data from these programs and all positions and redshifts from the literature. for the candels+ers program, we use a combination of methods from the borg / hippies program to break up high - redshift galaxies into discrete redshift slices, while for the uds+gs and ers programs we use our selection criteria to break - break sources into distinct sub - samples based on the positions and colors of individual lyman - break galaxies. the effectiveness of the selection criteria is utilized to determine the redshift range(s ) for each selection. we find that the surface density of galaxies as a function of magnitude and redshift is fairly constant over all five fields. however, due to the limited depth and wide area of the current data sets, contamination from pointlike sources can not be completely eliminated, even with the deepest available hst data. we present an updated estimate of the best contaminant sources. the surface densities of galaxies in each of the five candels fields we employ in conjunction with the available lorentz - limited deep goods surveys over an area of 7.8 square degrees are used to determine their stellar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and to construct model fits to our sed fits. with these seds we find the best - fit values for the slope, normalization, and magnitude - limited schechters at each redshift bin. we also find a slight trend of increasing mean redshift with apparent luminosity for galaxies in our sample at lower luminosity, but with some field - to - field variations. the trend is most clearly seen in the hudf, where galaxies lie on the underdense portion of the graph, in contrast to our other search fields. with the exception of a few likely outliers, we find no evidence of a strong
for loss - loss and gain - gain metamaterials, there is quantum noise that occurs both in the pump noise and in the effective dielectric function. this is of fundamental importance, because the effects of quantum noise can not be neglected in a quantum optical description. we show that the most accurate quantum optical effective - index theory involves only the effective index as the effective parameter, just like in classical optics. as a first test of this theory, we present here the output quadrature variances of loss - compensated as well as gain - compensated metmanaterials with homodyne detection. in both cases, the theory predicts the output to be squeezed, but here also the quantum noise component is quantum instead of thermal. finally, we give a quantum - optical effective medium ( qoem ) theory, that does predict accurate predictions also for loss - compensation metams. the quantum nature of light has become a central theme in quantum information science, with possible applications in quantum spintronics @xcite and in quantum computing with limited spatial and time - resolution spatial information processing ( lpcs ) @xcit. however, it has been difficult to achieve a practical realization of the ` spintronic quantum optics'( qqed ) concept in realistic situations, because of the intrinsic nonlinearities in the physics of spin systems. the challenge is thus to understand the experimental consequences of a quantum noise in the output of a device, which is difficult to realize in a realistic situation. indeed, quantum noise is usually rather uncorrelated with the underlying material that is used to implement the device, and it is not a useful quantity in a qiqed scenario. this brings up the problem of designing a theory that can predict the behavior of the material in the active region, in a way that is also consistent with the experiment. in this paper, we take a step forward this direction by proposing two effective - medium theories that are both quantum but have different shortcomings : they are based on pumping - induced transparency in a wave - function formulation, and they fail to describe the measurement of the effective noise without introducing unphysical noise compensation mechanisms. nevertheless, nevertheless, these shortcomings can be overcome with the help of these quantum effective theories. in sec. [ epslorentz ], we introduce a new type of effective medium, based on an effective index approach similar to classical effective medium theory ( eutm ), and show that both inversion and inversion are induced by quantum noise. the basic idea is to separate the pump -
by numerically integrating the equations of motion for the two- and three - dimensional soft billiards, we show incontrovertibly that islands of stability appear for _ arbitrarily small _ values of the softness parameter. such islands have already been discussed in [ phys. rev. lett. * 106 * 234101 ( 2011 ) ] and in [ arxiv:1112.5690 ] for a generic two - dimensional billiard. here we show numerically, that such islands are common in all regions of the parameter space. for a single billiard, the width of the stability wedge depends on both the geometrical parameter of the billiard and its initial eigenvalue. this effect is analogous to the ergodicity property of a hard wall gas for some initial conditions. we illustrate our results by means of explicit examples, and by a comparison with numerical simulations of a mixing billiard with artificial spatially symmetric potentials. [ cols="^",options="header ", ] in this paper we deal with the problem of eigenvalues of the return map between two or three dimensions. the geometric parameters are chosen such that the two interrelated eigenvectors of the map are identical, i.e., there is no degeneracy there. in the second case, we fix the geometry and then investigate the dynamics non - trivially. the aim of this paper is twofold. first, we want to understand in detail the kind of non - trivial solutions that may result from harmonic analysis for two or more dimensions. secondly, we also want to establish the exact relation between the harmonic expectation value and the area of the elliptic islands in the phase space. by using proper rescaling we show that it is possible to integrate numerically the full set of equations for arbitrarily small @xmath0. epsf.sty # 1#2#3#4#5#6.7 in.25 in
we perform three - dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamical ( spmhd ) simulations to investigate the effects of magnetic fields on the global evolution and morphology of radiatively cooling, heavy jets. we consider two physically distinct magnetic field geometries : ( i ) an initial longitudinal magnetic field configuration with relative permeation and ( ii ) a helical ( or helical ) configuration. we find that a jet confined by a toroidal magnetic field is unstable to the fundamental and reflection pinch and kink modes of the kelvin - helmholtz instability at the head. a cooling jet immersed in a longitudinal field, on the other hand, tends to retain the clumpy morphology at its head. if the jet is also supermagnetosonic, then it becomes more stable with increasing @xmath0. the formation of a clumpy structure is attributed to the development of a weak oblique shock due to the combination of strong shocks in the jet beam and strong pinches along its beam. in the presence of a non - zero velocity discontinuity at the boundary layer separating the two fluids, these pure hydromagnetic modes are modified by the assistance of the k - h instability. as in pure hd flows, the fastest growing kink reflection modes are expected to saturate with the existence of oblique shocks, while the fundamental modes may not saturate and may cause large - scale distortions and even disruption of the flow. however, the jets are not stabilized by nonlinear effects associated with increasing magnetic tension and disrupts near the resonant frequency of the fundamental kink mode. strong shocks along the beam tend to fragment into clumps, which are amplified and reoriented across the jet. these results are consistent with the predictions of the linear stability theory when applied to the bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by protostellar jets. deferring to the final version of the paper, which contains many of the conclusions and conclusions of the present work, will be submitted to the astrophysical journal.
the space interferometry mission ( sim ) is under development as nasa s first space - based optical interferometer devoted to micro - arcsecond ( @xmath0 ) astrometry. detection and measurement of planets around the closest stars will be carried out primarily with sim operated in narrow - angle astrometric mode. the instrument s exquisite sensitivity pushes detection two orders of magnitude lower, down to earth masses, while its measurability in terms of mass and orbital characteristics will have to be understood. the presence of giant planets orbiting on jupiter - like orbits, or more, is likely to be established. such objects, when found in systems harboring no close - in giant planets, are the signposts for the discovery of rocky planets in orbits closer to their parent stars, maybe even inside the star s habitable zone. sim will provide important observational data which will help us to learn about the dynamics of evolution of planetary systems, as well as contribute to the understanding of the intrinsic nature of sub - stellar companions. this paper presents results from extensive simulations of sim observations of extra - solar multiple - planet systems, to quantify sim s _ ultimate _ ability to detect and measure planets, as function of the basic sim capabilities and properties of the observed systems. we use the simulated dataset to characterize the potential for sim for finding single planets around a sample of the nearest solar - type stars and m dwarfs. we show that the limiting performance of sim in the field of extrasolar planetary science ( at the 95 % confidence level ) will be its ability to accurately measure crucial parameters ( inclination angle, mass, radius, orbital period, and planet mass ) of single planet systems around single stars in the vicinity of the solar system. we also show that sim s flexibility in observing strategies will allow it to clearly delineate the bounds of its discovery potential for terrestrial planets as small as earth, if they are present. such discoveries would provide prime targets for the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) program, which uses identifying the boundaries of the discovery space of sim for the first example of a terrestrial planet found by sim.
we present a detailed hydrostatic analysis of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in the bcg, a well - known cool core cluster at a redshift of 0.081. the entire region within @xmath0 on the sky was mapped with azimuthal and radial coverage, yielding unprecedented detail for this kind of analysis. we construct a detailed budget of systematic errors and assess the impact of different data analysis and modeling choices on the measurements. the largest systematic effects are associated with the background spectral models, metal abundances, and modeling the plasma emissivity variation with radius. although the results of the fiducial model are significantly different from those of the sersic model, we agree overall that the data are consistent with a power - law model with two breaks. in particular, we find the radial entropy profile of the icm to be described well by a simple power law, with a negligible deviation from the mean profile and some evidence for non - thermal pressure support. when these facts are factored out, the best - fitting total icm temperature, density, and baryon fraction are all consistent within the uncertainties, again with a plume - dominated model and a milky - way - like imf. the data also allow us to construct a nfw dark matter halo and, for the first time with this data, a detailed fit to the entire x - ray sky. the nfw halo reveals a remarkably regular distribution of baryons. as such, it does not provide a strong constraint on the evolution of the galaxy or on galaxy cluster structure. we compare our results to a variety of alternative models and find overall good agreement. the best of the flat - core models, e.g., either power - laws with a diverging slope or a singular sphere, can not fit the data as well as the ` ` universal '' pressure profile of @xcite. we prefer to explore the more complex models where a central engine is responsible for the heating of the entire icm.
we present new _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 high - quality photometry of 696 stars in the central @xmath014.3 mag of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy to study the ancient metal - poor galactic globular cluster m92. our adaptive algorithm is used to compute the orthogonal fiducial sequences for the 696 star - forming stars using the new _ hst _ photometry. we find that there are two closely spaced realizations of the _ observed _ relation between the observed faintness of the main sequence turnoff and the turnoff magnitude of the red giant branch. our _ adopted _ distance modulus of m92 is 0.04 mag smaller than the m92 one, but it is consistent with previous determinations in the literature : 0.03 mag. we show that the two distance moduli are statistically equivalent within a 3 magnitude range from the base of the giant branch of ursua minor to @xigsst, i.e. we get an excellent fit to the lee, demarque & zinn ( ldz ) distance scale. we determine the optical depth of the f555w / f814w h@xmath1 magnitude range for m92, and use it to shift the optical magnitude toward the direction of the old part of the subgiant branch in m92 in order to increase the metallicity of the reddening - corrected m92 by 0.1 dex. we obtain the optical - umi total intrinsic color offset of 0.19 mag. this is the same color offset value as was found in previous studies. our new distance estimate shows that m92 has an age of 3.5 gyr and is heavily reddened by 1.2 mag in the optical band. we compare the observed thin disk compared with m92 and find that its observed color offset is a factor of 1.4 - 2.5 smaller. this small offset is remarkable in the sense that the optical and ir colors of both galaxies are nearly identical within a magnitude range of 2 magnitudes. we propose that the observed low color offset can be explained by the fact that both galaxies have nearly the same total amount of extra reddening plus an almost identical amount of extinction. comparing the positions of these two faint analogs of the two galaxies with previous studies, we determine that umi is statistically _ older _ and has a higher mean age of 12 gyr. this may be correct if the true age of umi
tomei constructed a compact and orientable smooth manifold as an iso - spectral real manifold associated with the toda lattice equation on the set of tridiagonal symmetric matrices. in this paper, we consider an extension of tomei s manifold to a twisted weyl group orbit. the main idea of the paper is to consider a qr - factorization of the corresponding matrix function, whose image is the closure of an orbit under the usual action of real diagonal matrices of determinant one ( a split cartan subgroup ). using atiyah s theorem, the image of the moment map, with fixed eigenvalues, is the convex polytope with vertices at the critical points of the morse function. the theorem can be applied to each isospectral leaf of the leaf for a suitable choice of signs. we consider the case of weyl groups with i.i.d. entries @xmath0. theorem for the signed dynkin diagram, that is, the number of signs for a given integer, is obtained. then we have a cell decomposition of the weyl chambers and their walls. we compare the results of this with the ones due to bloch and show that the latter obtain a flow on the manifold which is smooth and has signs fixed along its walls. the result is compatible with the argument of bloch, and in fact, it improves it by showing that the manifold is actually kinematically smooth ( not just topologically smooth ) near its critical points. another advantage of the twisted action is that it does not produce a gradient flow. the expression for the flow is a convolution of the sign functions of the polytopes with the coefficients of the magnetization quadratic series. this provides us with an explicit example of a flow which is topologically equivalent to the connected sum of two torus lipschitz integrals for the semisimple lie algebras ( see figure [ fig:0 ] ). _ msc ( 2010 ) _ : 57m27 ( primary ), 57m20 ( secondary ) _ keywords ( pacs : 05.10.+f, 05.80.bp, 03.70.+r, 89.75.+q + _ nature of the physical problem _ the construction of a non - trivial smooth manifold by a complicated tapered geometry is a classical example of simplifying a euclidean space into a smooth compactification of its components under a prescribed gluing through the boundaries.
we investigate the growth of dark matter ( dm ) haloes in a set of high resolution cosmological simulations. we follow the dynamical evolution of the dm distribution in the central regions and analyse the impact of baryons on the results. as expected, inside - formed dm haloes show less massive satellites at all redshifts than their outside - formed counterparts. we also find hints for a re - distribution of angular momentum related to the accretion of satellites. we analyse the specific angular momentum content of the main baryonic component and its halo. we consider both non - substructure as well as the substructure induced by supernova ( sn ) feedback. in the former case, we found that even the inner @xmath0 of the stellar mass gains angular momentum as a function of redshift, whereas the increase is more important in the nf case. the gas component shows a similar behaviour but it is in the e-0.7 run where the gas acquired larger amount of ac momentum induced by the sn feedback which is successful at driving galactic outflows. we find that haloes hosting spheroidal galaxies tend to have weaker levels of velocity anisotropy than those hosted by dm - only haloes. also, when the presence of an important disc galaxy is considered, the central dm halo is more concentrated than the other haloes, reflecting the fact that the disc component is usually the dominating one in these simulations. when a nf - like halo hosts an early - type galaxy, later - type haloes are able to develop strong colliding discs and are more concentrated in the centre. these results can be used to explain the rotation curves observed from low surface brightness galaxies.

we present a preliminary measurement of the neutral current mixing angle, @xmath0, for the first time if only two neutrinos ( charged current and neutral current only ) are observed in world s neutrino beam. this measurement is based on a large data set accumulated by the calorimeter on the tevatron at fermilab, along with a search for new physics at large masses. the data were obtained in the framework of the on - shell renormalization scheme, including detector response, beam simulations, and a detailed model which included electromagnetic radiative corrections, isovector components, heavy quark production, and lepton mass effects. the _ preliminary _ results from the monte carlo experiment at hadron collider @xcite, using events with two oppositely charged muons, are shown to be consistent with each other and with the data, making this the most precise measurement of neutral current quark couplings to date. the difference in between the measured and the predicted results suggest that the data do not support a model - independent constraint on the neutral - current couplings. 6.5 in 9.0 in -0.50 in 0.00 in 0sk^0_s ps. 2q^2 2r_2 1spin - one 2gev_2 s. k. dai, h. li, y. liang, z. l. deng, c. d. dong@xmath3, s. y. du, j. f. fraser, v. frolov, d. a. didcot, m. dobrindt, r. ammar, w. bogaerts, p. barcik, f. berthelot, k. begzsuren, o. behnke, a. belousov, n. berger, m.- j. boenig, g. bernardi, t. berndt, j.- p. biebel, jr.
the corot ( convection, rotation and planetary transits ) space mission has provided us with a new set of high - resolution spectroscopic observations of a @xmath0 sct star, hd 50844. in this paper we summarize the results obtained from the analysis of the corot data and the ground based spectroscopy and photometry. the star is observed with a total of 134,257 datapoints over a time span of 238 days, i.e., excluding the effects of cancellation effects. the photometric timeseries are of very high quality, with more than 1000 independent peaks. the exploitation of the full dataset has allowed us to identify hundreds of independent terms in the light variability of the star. some of these terms can be identified as changes in the orbital frequency, which are found to be strongly modulated by the radial order of the orbit. the amplitudes of most of them are between 20 and 100 d@xmath2. we found that the eclipsing star has at least 235 possible sources of pulsation for a given radial order, amounting to a huge number of frequencies. the fraction of excited frequencies is about 40 %, which is totally new results. the light curves are characterized by a flat - bottomed light curve with an amplitude of about 0.01 mmag and a band width of about 20 mmag. the abundance pattern of the elements as c, n, o, ne, s and si is similar to that of the sun, while other elements are underabundant. we have also determined the abundances of these elements in the star and find that they are in the range [ fe / h]=0.2 to 0.4 dex. the obtained with the feros instrument of the chalchile observatory confirms the existence of a large number of tams ". as a by - product of the observations, we have identified two possibilites for the origin of the observed tams : atmospheric bump and saturation. the latter has the interesting property that it is located in the same region of the amplitude spectrum as the tams, thus providing us with an observational explanation for the richness of the frequency spectrum.
we apply the multipole method to four radio anomalous lens systems to test whether models that alter the global structure of the lens galaxy can explain their observed flux ratios anomalies. we find that a generalized isothermal multipole model can fit the observations for b1422 + 231, b2045 + 265, b0712 + 472, and b1933 + 503, but the model is highly elliptical and therefore incompatible with observations of elliptical galaxies. we estimate that the anomaly observed at radio wavelengths could therefore be explained with a multipole expansion of the gravitational potential of the galaxy. we thus conclude that the radio flux ratios of these systems are anomalously large because the lens galaxies are elliptical, and that the wiggles in the isodensity contours are minimized because of the presence of small - scale structure. before we can apply our method to other lens systems, however, we do nt find any other plausible models that can explain the observations. we refer to our method as the _ minimum wiggle approximation _, which describes the situation for q2237 + 0305 by minimizing the root mean square wiggle with respect to the coefficients @xmath0 for a cusp lens with a general but not flat rotation curve and arbitrary angular structure. in this approximation, the shear amplitudes we find are significantly smaller than the observed amplitudes in the octopole plane, which favors a model in which the isophotes are large, but not necessarily physically implausible. we also find that the _ maximum wiggle _ condition can not be satisfied for generalized multipole models that include shear. that leaves open the question of whether these models offer a viable explanation of the observed flux ratio anomalies. # 1#2#1#2 # 1 # 1;#2;#3;#4;#5 # 1, _ # 2 _, * # 3 *, # 4 ( # 5 ) # 1 ; # 2 ; # 3 ; # 4. _ einstein cross _, # 3 ( # 2 ). _ i.e. _, there is no indication of a wavelength - dependence in the flux ratios. _ j. bechtluft _, j. k. beumann _, u. kleineberg _, and _ institut fr astronomie und astrophysik, werner heisenberg institut, p.o. box 513, d-69117 mnster, germany _
we examine the atomic and molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) of the evolved ( @xmath0 kpc diameter ) ring galaxy am0644 - 741, also known as the ` ` lindsay - shapley ring '', using data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ), the swedish eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ), and ground - based optical imaging. the atca hi data are used to determine the distribution and kinematics of the neutral atomic ism around the ring, as well as the molecular gas. we find that the ring s molecular ism follows a peculiar star formation law, exhibiting peak sfr@xmath1 of @xcite, but _ not _ a concomitant enhancement of sfr over that of the surrounding galactic disk. we detect wnm - like emission lines in the ism, which is photodissociated by the expanding ring, possibly due to the action of supernova ( sne ) shocks. the weak co emission of the ring also reveals a large amount of molecular co, specifically in the innermost regions, where the co(j = 1 - 0 ) transition is detected for the first time. we propose that the rings of strongly star - forming ring galaxies may be viewed as overdensities of warm molecular gas ( wnm ), analogous to the situation in the cartwheel. an ` ` over - cooked '' ism can explain the observed elevated sfe, unusually small hcn, and low metallicity. furthermore, the ring possesses a small molecular fraction, which may be explained by the presence of a small cold molecular cloud within the ring. however, we note that this is not the case for the galactic disk, where star formation appears to be strongly suppressed due to pressure - induced wnm fragmentation of the wnm cloud. thus, the star formation activity in the ring is regulated by gravitational stability arguments, not by the molecular fraction. we discuss the implications of these results for the triggering and suppression of star formation in ring galaxies, and suggest that they may play an important role in the formation and regulates the luminosity output of current epoch massive bulge dominated galaxies.
in this paper we present a model where information is used as a fuel to extract work in a cyclic process. a demon is placed to monitor the system and extract energy. the system can interact with either thermal or chemical bath and it can exhibit erasure and refrigerator behavior. to show the non - equilibrium behavior of the system we consider a system connected to a bath of temperature t. the system is evolved by a protocol that can transfer energy out of the thermal bath and into the hot bath. then the demon can perform the same protocol repeatedly and recover the information. this process is called erasure in the sense that the entropy of the bath is reduced without using any energy. we show that this phenomenon can be observed in a system which is connected to one or more thermodynamic reservoirs. the work that is done by the demon is not necessarily physical. for instance, heat is not transferred from cold to hot body without doing any work, in case of szilard engine in analogy with second law of thermodynamics. but, in presence of information the former is not in equilibrium and some kind of energy is transferred to the latter. it is called measurement according to the landauer principle any logically irreversible transformation of classical information is necessarily accompanied by dissipation of at least @xmath0 of heat per lost bit. this leads to an entropy increase of the hydrostatic state and hence the states of memory have to be reset to the previous state. the main motivation of this study is to find the effect of thermal bias along with the work source and informational source.2 the study of thermal biases is very important from both theoretical and experimental point of view. especially, the effects of temperature, that is the ratio between the temperature of the hot to cold body, has been studied extensively. unfortunately, the existing studies on this issue are based on linear stochastic thermodynamics and there is no one to one correspondence between input and output of this process.
the new instrument concept scxm ( lectron x - ray monitor ) is proposed to make off - solar observations with a full detector fov of 1@xmath0, which is necessary to cover the energy range from 1.5 to 10 kev. the instrument concept is working with a ground - based and underground instrumentation with the goal to determine the performance ofscxm with respect to the limiting count rate in on - solar, i.e. full disc observations. the solar activity is a manifestation of the magnetic field originating from the solar convective zone. the magnitude of a flare event can be measured by measuring the x - rays emitted by the instrument from the high galactic latitudes, e.g. through the thickness of the solar limb. during a high solar activity the penetrating of the photosphere brings plasma out of the corona and can be responsible for heating the coronal plasma. the emission measure describing the electron density of these hot solar coronal elements changes during the flare due to the heating associated to the solar magnetic field. it could be also possible to resolve the locations of the highly ionized iron lines around 6.5 kev or above during the onset of flare events above c - level. the telemetry budget of scscm is estimated according to the design of the sixs x -ray spectrometer, which will be a payload instrument on board the bepicolombo satellite mission to mercury. there are no expectations for broad band spectroscopic observations in this instrument, mainly because of the low activity level and rapid energy response of the instrument. + the proposed instrument would be able to perform a diverse solar solar plasma diagnostics with the time resolution of 1 second corresponding to the existing read out electronics available. this would allow, for example, the determination of the plasma parameters like temperature, emission measure and plasma mass with an accuracy of 1 % at b - level activity. it would also allow to monitor the temporal evolution of a plasma temperature and emission measure with a time resolution 1 second, proportional to the expected turnaround time of this instrument. as an example we have made two broad band scxmm spectra, one at 1.1 kev and the other at 12.4 kev, which show the presence of several emission lines over a weak continuum. these data can be used to derive the respective plasma parameters and temperature diagnostics like current current voltage and voltage current and derive some emission line diagnostic from the two analyzed spectra. in this paper we also proposed the instrument design and the instrument
we report on the experimental investigation of the tunability and nonlinearity of a composite split - ring resonator ( srr ) as a potential for the realization of strong nonlinear metamaterials. the study of the resonant frequency dependent response of a varicap srr is employed through the investigation of its self - induced response to an applied dc bias voltage. a finite element method based electromagnetic simulator is used to calculate the srr s effective magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity using a spice model of the diode - system. the experimentally measured reflection coefficient ( @xmath0 ) is found to exhibit left - handed properties in agreement with recent numerical simulations. we verify the validity of the theory, and show that the presence of a small bias voltage is sufficient to dynamically control the material s effective parameters through its _ nonlinear _ response to the applied signal. through the integration of a suitable biasing voltage and the use of a vector network analyzer we establish a qualitative agreement between the measured and simulated upper and lower limits for the modulus of the reflection coefficient, and we confirm earlier predictions for the _ dynamic control _ over the properties of a srr. 10 f. v. veselago, ` ` negative index materials : new frontiers in physics, '' j. mod. phys. * 50, * s207s214 ( 2002 ). u. kelley, r. raussendorf, p. m. mow - lowry, d. bouwmeester, a. khalaidovski, t. moroder, m. n. nadolsky, s. sofia, j. w. thompson, l. a. nedeljkiewicz, v. p. zhang, and s. k. wiederhecker, _ josephson junction metals : molding the flow of electromagnetic waves _ ( princeton univ. press, princeton, nj 08544, 2008 ). j. s. b. pendry, g. r. smith, f. j. garca - vidal, n. g. pfeiffer, and b. l. braunstein, _ theory of electromagnetically induced transparency of an optical cavity with a negative refractive index _ ( wiley - interscience, new york, 2000 ). m. h. eberly, ` _ theory and methods for the manipulation of left -
* phase transitions during liquid - liquid transition ( llt ) in single - component molecular liquids are usually characterised by step - like and continuous changes in the order parameter, respectively. however, the nature of the first - order phase transition is not well understood. here we present by ultra - high - speed calorimetry, a change suggestive of the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition that occurs during annealing of liquid 1 ( glass 2 ). we reveal that upon heating, glass 2 that is formed by liquid 1 at a low temperature for a long time first transforms into liquid 2 via the glass transition and then almost simultaneously liquid 2 becomes liquid 1 via the reverse llt. this leads to the coexistence of the two disordered liquid phases during llt and the transformability between them. reflecting this, we then reveal by molecular dynamics that there are two types of llts, ng - type and sd - type llt, which are respectively in their metastable and unstable states. * phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature and have a wide range of applications. in biology, they are responsible for the formation of bio - molecules, while they are of importance in energy storage, growth, and harvesting of natural resources. in materials, where llt is thought to be relevant, a major task is to understand the precise transitions between different liquid phases and their coexistence. for example, the crystal nucleation and subsequent crystallization are believed to be crucial for the stability of crystals @xcite. in the context of chemistry and materials science, llt plays a crucial role as a diagnostic tool to discriminate between different models and to gain insights into the physical processes in a specific system. furthermore, llts are expected to be important in the elucidation of new phases of matter and to lead to a deeper understanding of the liquid state of matter. although llts have been studied for many years, there are still many open questions concerning their nature, including their reversibility, their non - equilibrium dynamics, and the phase transition between two distinct liquid phases. these issues are even more complicated in the presence of strong interactions between the constituents of a llt system and those between the underlying molecular liquid and the process of its transformation. despite these challenges, there is a great deal of progress so far in understanding the basic processes of llt in molecules and crystals. recent research activities are mainly based on scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ), ultracold gases and high - energy x - ray reflectivity spectroscopy ( xrras )
using hydrodynamical simulations of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in cosmologically motivated disk galaxies over a range of representative masses, we study the connection between the molecular content of the ism and the star formation properties of galaxies. we devise a model for star formation rates ( sfrs ) that utilizes the temperature - dependent interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) as the basis for a star formation model, in which the total ism surface density is calculated from the gas surface density, and the sfr is linked to the molecular gas density with a universal star formation efficiency ( sfe ) per free - fall time. the resulting ism - model correlations and trends are examined in terms of the @xmath0 that characterizes the power - law index of the molecular - gas schmidt - kennicutt ( sk ) relation and the scaling relation that relates star formation rate surface density to the gas density. we find that in a model that includes heating and cooling processes including the isrf, the global sk relation ( measured in annuli ) is truncated at a scale that depends on the local gas density, temperature, and isrf surface density. this is a result of the coupling of the global sfr with these local ism properties such as the atomic cooling rate and the efficiency of gas cooling and accretion. our simulations show that variations in the molecular fraction of gas at high pressure are found to have little effect on the calculated sfr surface density and that the local sfe does not primarily depend on the temperature nor the density of ism. we thus derive a prescription for the sfe as a function of disk galaxy mass that can be used as a benchmark to compare other galaxies. in our model galaxies produce a universal sfe that is a power law above the local value, with a slope that is insensitive to galaxy surface density variations and to the local dynamical time. we also show that the effect of radial variations on the gas scale height and molecular fraction in galaxies of different masses can be accounted for through a structural, sk - like correlation. our results provide a variety of new insights into the mass dependence of sfe in galaxies and into the nature of the intergalactic medium.
we consider how to factor the jacobian into irreducible factors in @xmath0, and we give a new proof that the polar roots of an arbitrary tree model ladder need not be invariant of the tree, as in the one function case. we also give a proof of the classical theorem of rouch. the contact structure of the two curve germs is not invariant with respect to the tree roots ; we show this to be true for all but the ideal case when the tree is a tree. polar roots, i.e. the ones that climb over non - collinear bars, are a natural class of _ branches of mero - zero trees _, and they play a central role in many geometric constructions. given a _ main trunk _ of a tree, we ask _ what _ is the least distance that a polar root can climb over it in order to get to the base of the main trunk? _ by the way _, we mean the height of the trunk that ( in general ) depends on the contact number of the nearest neighbor trees. for example, the length of a trunk is the _ total multiplicity _ of its branches ; and the total multiplicities of all polar roots are the polynomials of the branches. this is well known, but we shall not solve this problem completely here. we shall solve it in two ways. the first is to use _ branches with loops _, a geometric concept that has been used extensively in the theory of binary trees all through the literature, to find the branch number which is bounded by the greatest number of polar roots. the second method is to approximate the tree model by a collection of branches, and then to factor out the coefficients of the loops. we can do this in many ways, and it is easy to see that both of them are of interest to study. we particularize the one - loop method of @xcite and other topological models, and use it to get new results on polar root positions on trees. a _ tree model _ is a geometric object that allows us to visualize the contact structures of branches ; we call _ branches _ in this language. a branch is _ tree _ if there is a genealogically natural graph on the tree whose leaves are long enough to make the diameter ( or some more length ) of the branch smaller than the diameter of the original branch. the concept of a root, on the other hand, has applications in many branches, from leaves of trees to grape leaves
we investigate the metallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha ( dla ) systems based on the latest high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath0cdm model. in agreement with recent observations ( dunne et al. 2000 ; nagamine etal. 2001a ; ), we find that the average metallcity of dlas decreases from 0.086@xmath1 at redshift 3 to 0.053@z=1.22 at 12 months ago when the redshift has been resolved. over this redshift interval, dlas are typically found in massive galaxies and live in environments where the galactic gas has been stripped off. while such environments are common in the local universe ( e.g., clusters of galaxies ), dla hosts are relatively rare in high redshift galaxies ( 13 % of the dla population are members of such systems ). the median luminosity of a dla, @xfig0, in units of typical galaxy luminosity at that redshift ( 3.4 phases ) is about half of the value for galaxies of similar stellar mass, implying that a considerable fraction of dla gas is accreted by forming galaxies. we also find that, in a wide range of environments, the fraction of metals in dlas that live in hot intergalactic medium approaches half of that of all gas in the universe at a given redshift. the implication is that dlas may have a significant fraction of underabundance " in the intra - cluster medium at low redshifts. contrary to a naive expectation, the computed mean metallopic of all dlas shows a very slow evolution with time. most dlas host galaxies that are mass poor, have low metal yields and are relatively metal rich. under this assumption, the observed depletion of metals into dlas and the subsequent accretion of metal - enriched gas from those dlas hosted by massive galaxies are predicted to occur over a wide redshift range, and to be in reasonably good agreement with observations. # 1to 0pt#1 accepted for publication in the astrophysical journal.
we reconstruct a large, yet detailed map from genotype to phenotype of the _ escherichia coli _ bacterium _ using mutagenized transcriptional regulatory sequences. the data consists of 129,000 sequences of length @xmath0 from the 75 nucleotide dna region containing the camp receptor protein ( crp ) and the rna polymerase ( rnap ) binding sites, each of which is known to bind to the _ e. coli _ protein. we build a linear regression model that connects the sequences to their phenotypes. the number of pairs of mutations and interactions between all of the nucleotides is logarithmically correlated, and the epistatic interactions are included in the model by controlling the complexity of the models. the resulting map shows large fluctuations, which can be explained by the variability of the data. the largest variation is due to the fact that the data sample is very dense, so that every pair of mutations has occurred at least 20 times, each time in a different genetic background of about 5 additional mutations. thus the data effectively encode a large number of mutations, which are independent of the presence of other mutations. we then analyze the statistics of epistatic effects in the inferred map. for example, under optimal selection, the map shows that the preferences of the genotypes of the subjects ( i.e., the dominant ones ) are strongly correlated with the preferred expression of certain proteins, such as crp. the degree of correlation can be quantified by the fraction of the genes that mutagenize, the energy matrix, or the fraction that express their genes in a non - coding dna. when the data are binned into subpopulations, the correlation among various energy matrices is comparable to the 95 % correlation among the data matrices. selection, however, is a stronger predictor of fitness than the data alone. thus we suggest that the discrimination between genotypes is not completely due to selection, but rather due to a balance between fitness and genotype. finally, we estimate the total random variation in the resulting fitness landscape and find that it is consistent with that derived from fluorescence measurements.
we study the dynamics towards the feigenbaum attractor and its corresponding repellor using a novel statistical - mechanical approach. this approach possesses two crucial properties that are not known previously, i.e. the sensitivity to initial conditions and a scaling of trajectories towards the attractor. first, we find that trajectories that arrive at the respective attractors share an infinite - level structure with a hierarchy of hierarchy, which increases as the period of the supercycle increases. second, we determine the general procedure followed by trajectories to reach both attractors, and their complementary repellors, which is a highly structured process encoded in sequences of positions shared by as many trajectories with different initial conditions. we obtain the leading - order characteristics of the dynamics in terms of the @xmath0-deformation of the ordinary exponential weight statistics. as a final point, we examine how these properties are reflected on the properties of the trajectories as they pass through the fractal boundaries separating the basins of attraction of the periodic orbits from the ones of the repellor. we show that there is a similar structure in the dynamics between the two sets of properties, which reflects in the hierarchical structure of the preimage structure, final state sensitivity and ( transient ) chaos. epsf.tex # 1#2#3acta. phys. pol. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) [ 3]phys. rev. lett. * d#1*(#2 ), # 3 ( # 4 ) [ 5 ( # 1)example.proposition.proposition # 1 # 2 _ # 1 _ # 2 = 11 # 1 = by60 = # 1bsphack@filesw gtempa@nobreak esphack eqnlabel#1 # 1 ( # 2 ) # 1@th@ubmqc.ac.uk # 1 introduction # 1 * diffusion of universality * * in disordered systems * * m. hu and a. rudnick * + department of mathematics + faculty of mathematics, university of california, santa barbara, ca 93106 - 1580, usa + e - mail : hu@sas.upenn.edu * * keywords : * chaotic systems, chaos, preimages, finite element, statistical mechanics
we measure the 2-point correlation function, @xmath0, between absorbers and galaxies, as a function of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) column density and spectral type, and compare the results with previous observational surveys and cosmological simulations. the observational data consists of a sample of 16 absorption - line galaxies which overlap with the absorption line sample at z = 2.107. we find that the strength of the correlation function between hi quasar absorption systems and galaxies increases with hi column density, and is probably stronger in real space on scales of 0.0513@xmath1 than in the sample in redshift space. at low column density the two - point correlation function is significantly steeper than the average, with a peak near 0.096@xcite. a tentative evidence is found for a steeper peak in the cross - correlation function for absorbers of higher column density. the auto - correlation of the galaxies is also affected : while the peak value of the absorber - galaxy correlation function varies from @xcite as the column density is increased, the amplitude of the velocity difference between absorber galaxy pairs with detected civ absorption is typically smaller than that for those with detected hi absorption only. we also find tentative evidence for an increase in the absor - galaxy bias towards stronger clustering on cosmic scales, although the details are obscure. we use our measurements to place constraints on the rest - frame b - band absolute magnitudes of our galaxy sample : confining our attention to the galaxy - igm relationship which persists up to redshifts @xik2, our limiting magnitudes range approximately between 0.3 and 0.8 ( resp. 0.2 from the 2df analysis ). our results show that the ` ` finger of god '' of galaxy clustering is caused by galaxy outflows, and that processes such as superwinds are likely to have imprinted a relic signature on the igm.

we propose to replace the existing dot mounted on the equatorial telescope of the observatory of the canary island national observatory del roque de los muchachos ( ao ) with a new 1.4-m primary mirror and an additional canopy to provide high - cadence line - profile sampling and multi - wavelength image stabilization. we present a possible combination of ao with post - detection numerical wavefront restoration and adaptive optics re - imaging to produce apertures large enough to provide diffraction - limited images in chromospheric lines for the first time. the telescope structure is suggested to include a tandem ao canopy made of a large open tower and a fold - away canopy that is highly transparent to the laminar winds of the wind at the base of the shaft. operating at 2.5 m, the canopy would provide excellent seeing in the chromosphere and reduce wavefront deformations from wind - induced distortions of the primary mirror. we discuss options to extend the dot support to increase the dot aperture to meter class size in order to increase both the observing mode and efficiency in observing. the proposed options include ( 1 ) a new 40-cm diameter primary mirror, ( 2 ) a flat - root - deformation - free primary mirror for easy viewing, ( ` ` optics '' ), and ( 3 ) a @xmath0-band lens with a field - of - view of 0.55 degree field of view that can be transversal pupil shift of 15 cm. the cost of the optics upgrades and installation of the new mirrors and the proposed tower - canopy arrangement ranges from 250 keuro to 500 keuro. the university workshops are needed to maintain the proposed optics system and accommodate the new mirror support. * deutsches elecen - synchrotron * * + * desy 10 - 165 september 2010 + * the astronomy and astrophysics department, university of california at berkeley and lawrence berkeley national laboratory, berkeley, ca 94720, usa * notkestrasse 85 - 2219, altaddress = department of physics, montana state university, p.o. box 1692, davis, montreal, qc, h3a 2a3, canada address= department of mechanical engineering, columbia university, new york, ny 10027 address = laboratoire de physique thorique, cea / dsm / saclay, gif sur yvette, 91191, france address
we exhibit a new family @xmath0 of quandle coloring invariants, which we introduce in this paper, related to the tree level diagrams of dihedral quandles and other alexander polynomials of knots. as a first result we show that the number of geometrically connected geometrical graphs supported by the finite field is independent of the topological type of the knot, thus obtaining a new bound on the genus of knots supporting this family. in fact, in the case of knots, we give a new result that, as a generalization of a classical result due to joyce and matveev, holds true up to discreteness. in the last few years, we have been interested in the study of the connections between topological invariants and colorings of graphs. a lot of work has been done ( e.g. @xcite ) on this kind of connection, but a unified picture of these connections has yet to be developed. in particular, it is well known that the following problem seems to be open. if every knot is connected to a euclidean string ( i.e. a knot field which is singular under the cup product of two linear groups of knots of genus at most one ), then the d - choice of a polynomial function to graphize this string is arbitrary. it is therefore highly desirable to have a simple, compact, generic invariant to choose from among the many types of links that one can consider. our approach is mainly motivated by the following problems. first of all, we would like to know the above question as a prior to asking it a simple but very natural question : _ what is the nearest relation, if any of the above questions can be confidently answered. _ our answer is that the answer depends on the knot type and on the orientations of the components of the links. for instance, if a knot is a seifert surface, up to isomorphism the answer is well defined and independent of both the type and the degree of disjointness of the curves of graphs supporting it. on the other hand, when the graph is a graph, we do not have such a simple answer : _ there is no simple relation between the two types of link that we can make with the current technique. the solution to this problem is much harder than one might expect. the general case of connected homomorphisms is even more difficult, and it relies on more sophisticated methods, such as the one introduced by
we propose a new type of collider experiment to search for a slow decay of the lightest neutralino ( @xmath0 ). such a decay can naturally exist in gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models as well as in a class of no - scale supergravity ( sugra ) models. our scheme is based on a large hadron collider surrounded by a thick shield, which causes most of the collider products to decay in a long decay tunnel. the decay arrival time and the large off angle of the decay product will provide an unambiguous signal of slowly decaying@xmath1 s. we also show that, in case of the @x0 decay into a photon and a light invisible particle such as @xik2 or @xcite, the mass of the stable charged particle will appear to be ` ` stable '' even in our experiment. one can search for heavy long -lived charged particles also with our setup by precisely measuring their time - of - flight and the mass excess at the end of the tunnel. furthermore, we illustrate how the scheme can be used for the search for any long - lived charged particle at the cern lhc. finally, we discuss other search results which are possible with our set - up. epsf.tex # 1#2#3 _ erratum _ * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) desy-09 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * search for slowly decaying neutralino, axion, muon, and light gravitino * + _ ibid. _ + _ institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt wrzburg, campus hubland nord, emil - fischer - str. 31, d-97074 wrzbata, germany + _ jinr, institute of high energy physics, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland + _ molokanova state university, moscow region, 141980, russia + _ faculty of physics and astronomy, university of ljubljana, jadranska 19, saturnia + _ fermilab, theory division, jagellonian university, + ul. nawojki 11, cracow, poland _
we propose a feasible quantum method of quantum metrology based on local quantum estimation of a small parameter, namely the quantum fisher information, in the immediate vicinity of a quantum phase transition. we show that the operator which measures on all sites simultaneously the magnetization at all sites can be directly measured on the quantum spin hamiltonian with an accuracy high enough to go beyond the heisenberg limit by reaching @xmath0. we propose an analytical formulation of the model in terms of a universal quantum estimator finding excellent agreement with numerical results for bosonic lattice simulations. moreover, we discuss the feasibility of the proposed approach in the context of cold atom optical lattices. finally, we point out that the effect of finite temperature on the performance of the estimator is discussed in detail. measurement of quantum properties of matter is an important open problem in modern condensed matter physics. the essence of such measurements is to determine so called parameters, such as the magnetic field, temperature, density of states, etc. within a system subject to a periodic potential, which only a limited number of parameters may be measured with high accuracy. due to the limited time available to measure these parameters, in general one may try to make a measurement of the ground state properties of the system. for example, to measure the location of a particle, for example to check whether it is a protein or an antiferromagnet, one generally has to be interested in comparing the measurements on different surfaces. this is done by measuring the on - site magnetization @xcite as a function of the proximity of the particle to the critical point, i.e. the fisher information. the latter is usually considered as an ultimate bound that one may have to reach in order to probe the unknown quantum reality. however, when the system is detuned from criticality, the ultimate bound becomes much smaller. hence, unlike in the standard metrology, the ability to access this limit is not immediately available to us to experimentally observe this ultimate bound, even if, by adding short - range interactions to the original one - body hamiltionian. the aim of this article is to discuss how to overcome this difficulty in the estimation process by means of a simple quantum procedure. the method we propose is based on a local quantum unitary generator approach, which remains relatively simple, but remains relatively robust in principle, and can be implemented with the current state - of - the - art technology of optical lattice tunable measurement instruments. we consider a one - dimensional ferromagnetic heisen
we compare recent yields of carbon and nitrogen with predictions by various authors for the production of these elements by massive stars. we employ both analytical and numerical models to examine the dependence of these two abundance ratios on metallicity as gauged by oxygen abundance. the yields represent a range of yields for both massive and intermediate - mass stars and demonstrate that the observed trends in carbon / nitrogen abundance ratios as a function of o / h can be largely explained if, as reported, these ratios are set by the primary nitrogen production of massive stars ( primarily massive stars ). in the case of nitrogen, the dominant production site(s ) of the chemical elements are massive stars, with nearly all of the nitrogen being produced by intermediate mass stars. carbon is primarily produced by moderate - mass ( 4 4 8 m@xmath0 ) stars, while nitrogen is only moderately produced by massive ( 3 - 8 m*xmath1 ) stars. these results indicate that the yield of carbon from massive stars is independent of the initial composition of the star, the degree of carbon enrichment by superwinds of metal - rich massive stars being shown to be primarily determined by initial mass loss. we thus suggest that the origin of carbon is solely determined by the metal enrichment of an old metal - poor population and the subsequent accretion of unenriched gas. in this picture, objects such as blue compact galaxies and outer regions of spiral disks are several gyr in age despite their low metallicities. we calculate yields for the main elements carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances relative to oxygen and find that the most appropriate yields for a broad range of metallicities are those of van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ). we also calculate yields of nitrogen for which the observed behavior of n / o versus 12+log(o / h ) is consistent with the behavior of maeder ( 1992 ). these yields indicate that carbon production is primarily decoupled from the main production sites of nitrogen and oxygen ; in particular, carbon production for an assumed time delay of @xmath250myr is required for both oxygen and nitrogen to build up to the maximum possible level.
we study the dynamical coalescence of tidally locked black hole neutron star systems using a numerical code that is based on the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique. we model the neutron star as a compressible tri axial ellipsoid in orbit about a point mass companion, and follow its dynamical evolution for several million binary orbits. we present simulations for a range of mass ratios ( @xmath0 ), and a broad range of initial orbital parameters, including inclination, radius and separation. the companion is modeled as a polytrope with an absorbing black hole. the initial neutron star is relaxed, and the computed mass and momentum balance is used to ensure that the system is in equilibrium. we carry out two - dimensional dynamical simulations starting with a spherical neutron star relaxed in isolation, and find that there are quantitative differences in the evolution of the system when the black hole is introduced into the equation of state. for a model with a stiff black hole - neutron star collision, the black holes produce gravitational waves with a peak amplitude of about 5 % of the gravitational wave luminosity ( compared to 20 % for the canonical case with a gentle black hole ). violent episodes of mass transfer occur more often for the stiffer model, but are always accompanied by secondary mass transfer events for the moderate mass ratio systems. for the softest model, and low mass ratio, the gravitational waves are suppressed significantly by the ejection of matter from the stellar core, but the signal continues to exhibit a finite amplitude at a frequency corresponding to the new orbital period and includes the second periastron passage of the core. the remnant signal is absent for all mass ratios we have simulated. these results have important implications for the determination of the abundances of dark matter in the galaxy. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # 1= to [ firstpage ] binaries : close stars : neutron x - rays : binaries gamma rays : bursts methods : numerical
we present evidence for a change in the physical properties of the regions of galaxies at high luminosity, in the range @xmath0 = 38.6 erg s, commonly referred to as the strmgren transition. we argue that there should be an accumulation of regions around the luminosities of the transition, termed ` ` glitches '' in the luminosity functions. using a set of fairly schematic models, we show that the process of density bounding ought to give rise to the form of the lf observed in, and that the other hypothetical causes modeled for the observed behavior are in no way as plausible. for the most luminous regions there is at first thought to be an overlapping of regions, which would produce a lf not unlike that observed. indeed the regions we study are massive, with an average density which does not depend strongly on luminosity. as a result, the total luminosity of the region scales with the mass within that region, as predicted by our models. on the other hand, if the regions contain a significant population of stars, the slope of their lf should be steeper than the slope in the lower luminosity region. we present scaling relations which support the density - bounding hypothesis, and suggest applications to the correction of the global star formation rates in galaxies, and to the measurement of intergalactic distances. although the sample of results presented here is not large, the implication for the ionization of the intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies is of considerable potential interest. we discuss possible causes of the phenomenon, and outline potential applications to improved measurements of distances and the star formation history of the galaxy. # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 1 # 1 to size # 1 = to size = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx9 scaled2 ps. 2 = 6truein galaxies : spirals galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies : statistics
we study the non - stationary dynamics of a system coupled to a dissipative environment. in order to understand the dynamics we consider a wide range of drivings @xmath0. maxwell - bloch type equation is used to study steady - state dynamics. we show that the entanglement between the qubit and photon degrees of freedom increases with the driving field having a constant amplitude and phase. this is in agreement with the predictions from the mean - field theory. our results indicate the existence of a bistable regime where a driving field is applied to qubit mode which is localized in resonator frequency. we also demonstrate that the system become unstable to non - adiabatic photon driving after a sufficiently long time. ever since kepler s discovery of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute gases of relativistic electrons @xcite, non - equilibrium dynamics have been a focus of scientific research. in particular, the field of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has been rapidly advancing and close to the experimental realization of few- and many - body systems, depending on the strength of coupling to photons. the interest in such systems is at least two - fold. on one hand, they provide experimental facilities to explore novel states of matter and control quantum state - of - the - art devices. on the other hand, qed has the potential to be a powerful tool in quantum information processing and communication. in recent years, e.g., superconducting metamaterials and transmission line have been developed to the point of becoming a viable tools for quantum computing. in these devices a single qubit is coulombically coupled to several photons forming a hybrid system. in such hybrid system an ensemble of qubits and photons decays together into a single photon state. dynamics of the system can be well described by the janes - cummings model which is exactly integrable in the limit of low density. one of the conditions to obtain a well - defined quantum state is that it must be steady state, i.e., the system must behave in a deterministic way under forcing. in other words, this is the bistability regime where different qubits behave in different ways and the dynamics can not be described by single effective hamiltonian. this can be realized, for example, by means of lindblad equation which takes into account fluctuations in qubit occupation number with respect to photon one. the situation is quite different in the regime of strong coupling
we present results for the chaotic pseudo - inverse ising spin system with at least @xmath0 units in a stationary state. the unit eigenvalues are chosen to have the properties of the generalized bernoulli map. a possible excursion to the metastable states of the system is considered. the number of different small scale chaotic attractors ( sg ) depends on the size of the network, and was found to be exponentially zero for the model under study. we also report results for overlaps between trajectories of different sg attractors, and between two vastly separated time windows. * disordered systems asymptotically freeze in the center of curvature @xcite. in the absence of feedback the time evolution of a unit in a fixed, possibly inhomogeneous, configuration will often be frozen and the unit will be called a _ chaotic attractor_. just such a system is a prototype of a more general system ; however it is not easy to define the definition of the boundary or the boundaries between these different systems since they are usually so complicated. there are several attempts ; the most common one being to define a bisector between two manifolds in such a way that the units are isolated and the only interaction is with the periphery, e.g., through an external field. the disordered system in this analogy is not so distinct from the other systems of this kind : while in the case of the bisector there is only one insulating state, the network as a whole may have many insulating states with different behaviors, including the fundamental ones of orthogonality and magnetism. chaos is a ubiquitous feature of complex systems where chaos is emergent over a very wide range of length scales ranging from minutes to decades. usually, the chaotic dynamics is self - induced and occurs randomly. on the other hand, there is usually a symmetry under which the dynamics is also chaotic but the structure of the patterns, the way it appears, is usually not so clear. in this article we show how the chaotic network, whose dynamics is set to a random initial condition, can be understood as a chaotic system frozen in the point of contact with a macroscopic basin of attractions. we introduce parameters that governs the dynamics and the presence of other attractors besides the tiny deterministic patterns. the model is constructed from the hubble equation and the dynamical evolution is observed as an average over time steps, which is underlined by the addition of patterns to the hamiltonian. results indicate a positive lyapunov exponent
by proper orthogonal decomposition, we investigate the turbulent heat transfer in a cylindrical cell in the dynamic regime of rayleigh - bnard convection. the three - dimensional direct numerical simulation is conducted for aspect ratios @xmath0 in the range from 0.5 to 4 and rayleigh numbers between 0.1 and 1. the prandtl number is also kept fixed. we observe a dependence of the turbulent energy transport on the aspect ratio according to a dimensionless nusselt number @xcite. the first three pod modes, which correspond to the large - scale circulation ( lsc ), appear in the statistics of the time - averaged velocity fields. these modes include the primary mode which transports about one half of the total energy and the secondary mode, which transports the remaining half. we also distinguish between a single roll and a two - roll lsc. the relative frequencies of the secondary and tertiary modes are found to be independent of the rayleigh number and the range of accessible aspect ratios. the ratio of the largest to the smallest roll increases with increasing aspect ratio and is always smaller than unity. the number of counter - rotating rolls that exist in the whole cell is found to reorganize with the increase of aspect ratio. the lsc patterns reorganize from roll - shapes to pentagonal or hexagonal structures with increasing factora as well as with increasing rayleigh and prndtl numbers. at fixed aspect ratio, we observe quasi - periodic patterns. these patterns correspond to swirling patterns, which are similar to the patterns observed at the onset of convection in karhunen - kring turbulence. we suggest that these findings might be due to the introduction of a closed volume " flow regime in the convective system beyond the closed convection line. indeed, similar closed volume patterns have been observed in our simulations in the dynamics of turbulent velocity fields in a variety of geophysical and astrophysical flows. although the present results are based on a systematic analysis, more systematic studies are still required to determine the true scaling properties of the observed patterns.
we present a suzaku x - ray monitoring campaign for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548, designed to follow the response of the warm or ionized absorber ( wa ) to continuum variations. we make use of the seven observations of the source performed in a search for variability in the grating spectral index in order to measure the physical properties of the absorber. we use a new technique, which is much more sensitive to spectral variability than previous methods, and we find that the temperature and column density of the absorbing gas can be well modeled by a model with two absorbing components in pressure balance, with very different ionization parameters. we model the properties of one component as a sum of two ( the hv - ship ) and fit a power law model to the data, taking into account the radial and outflow velocities of the wind and the neutral currentients of the gas. the line - of - sight ionization parameter of this component is consistent with being constant during all observations, and the equivalent width of the column density profile can be constrained by modeling the absorption between the two velocity components as a function of distance from the ionizing source. we can not, however, rule out the possibility that this absorber arises in the accretion disk as in the case of ngc 4051. this would imply that the wind lies far away from the central black hole in this source ( @xmath0 pc ), and it would be inconsistent with the location of the obscuring torus in the photoionized spectrum of this active galaxy ( peterson et al. 2007 ). if the absorbing material is located in the disk, it would have to be much closer to the black hole than the average large scale outflow rate of agn winds in their hosts. the total kinetic energy injected by these winds in response to the continuum variations can be much higher than the amount required to disrupt the interstellar medium in order for the wind to have any significant effect on their large scale environment. this implies that agn warm absorber winds may have important effects on their host galaxies.
background : : it is generally believed that the quadrupole correlation, usually taken to be the dominant correlation mode in all but doubly magic nuclei, is in fact the dominant source of energy for all but very light nuclei. we investigate this question using a systematic calculation for the correlation energy of all but the lightest nuclear systems. our approach does not attempt to a universal nuclear model but has the long - range goal of a mean - field theory that allows for the simultaneous consistent and systematic description of many observables, including excited states. methods : : the particle - number and angular - momentum projection is used together with the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) to solve the equations of the mean field. this strategy has obvious advantages for the most prominent application of nuclear mass formula, the description of nucleosynthesis in astrophysics. outcomes : : we find that the application of the gcm yields the best results in the sense that the energy - density functional of a particle - hole state is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to that of a skyrme - like state, the state with a symmetry broken by the goa ( local goa ) approximation. we also find a deep prolate minimum, the static deformation of the nucleus, results in a gain of 12.2 mev in binding energy and a doubling of the mass residuals. we discuss the role of angular momentum in this study. conclusions : : using the method proposed here, the binding energy of quiescent nuclei with nonzero angular momentum and low excitation energy ( @xmath0 mev ) is significantly larger than that of typical hard core - collapse supernovae. using the results of the nuclear models, we perform a detailed comparison of the angular momentum projection with the hausdorff - weyl projection on particle number. this comparison shows that the inner regions of the deformation are even more strongly affected by angular momentum variations than the outer regions. the method presented here can be applied in the field of nuclear structure physics.
the blazhko effect in rr lyrae stars is extremely strong a hypersonic shock, with an amplitude exceeding 30 % of the total pulsation amplitude. it greatly complicates our measurements of the atmospheric dynamics of these stars and introduces unavoidable complications in an understanding of stellar pulsation and evolution. i present a new series of high precision circular polarization spectroscopic observations of rvuma, a rrab star with a pulsation period of 48 days, obtained with the high resolution uv visual echelle spectrograph uves. the data show hydrogen ( double ) emission lines during rising light, helium emission lines, neutral metallic line disappearance phenomenon, line broadening and doubling, which cause a discontinuity in the radial velocity curve. the hump and the bump are clearly visible in the uves spectra. hydrogen emission is formed in the zone of the cooling wake just behind the shock front and the he absorption line formation region, due to the de excitation of the neutral helium atom. thus, the h@xmath0 and the pashen lines are less affected by the shock waves propagating in the atmosphere. in addition, the he i triplet and the balmer lines show a strong blue shifted component at the hump, which is correlated with the red shifted one associated with the hump. no significant circular polarization is detected in the mean stokes profiles over the 4 year period, leading to an uncertainty in the value of the longitudinal magnetic field strength of @xmath1 1.5 kg. by comparing the results with the magnetic fields of other rrab stars, i argue that the difference in the strength of the magnetic field between rr lyr and sarae stars, not only depends on the pulsational properties, but also on the optical depth of the blazar, implying that the oblique dipole rotator model, as proposed by balazs - detre ( 1964 ), is not able to determine the relevant mechanism at the origin of the deexcitation threshold temperature of 229,082k. i like the ` ` classical'schwarzschild mechanism, that the shock ( initial ) velocity is strongly supersonic and the conditions within the shock wake are extreme. this means that, the shock temperature is higher, and reaches a temperature value of 285,367k, i.e., the minimum energy requirements are a factor of 1.59ev. magnetic fields are found to be very weak, in general agreement with the results of stothers ( 2006, 2010 )
we investigate the influence of the sun on the formation of the moon s impact craters using the bicircular restricted four body problem. to this purpose, we use well - known procedures to compute periodic lyapunov orbits around the stable invariant manifold of the @xmath0 equilibrium point. this allows us to determine the characteristics of small - scale orbits pushing a massless particle under low - energy regimes. in particular, we consider orbits in which the particle can take the following steps : ( 1 ) we check the stability of the orbit : through a backward integration, we determine the conditions under which a minor body of infinitesimal mass can leave the main asteroid belt. ( 2 ) we investigate the possibility of detecting orbits other than the circular orbit that can lead to a lunar impact : we implement a method that allows to reproduce the behaviour associated with the unstable component of any central orbit and does not need to distinguish between them. ( 3 ) we study the distribution of impacts that minor bodies can create in the earth moon system. in this way, we get a measure of the deviation of the region of heavier impact from the main crater distribution in terms of the fraction of collisions concentrated on the leading side of the lunar surface. for the latter we analyse also the sun s gravitational attraction on these paths. from this analysis, we conclude that the moon is locked in a spin - orbit resonance and is acting as a potential shield for the earth. ( 4 ) finally, by means of the upc applied math cluster system, we analyse the solar system evolution, focusing on the region where the greatest concentration of collisions takes place : ( 5 ) the main impact takes place at the lunar poles and ( 6 ) the relative size of the crater that forms at the end of the excavation stage depends on the asteroid s size, speed and composition, on the material and geometry of the surface on which the crater forms and on the surface gravity of the target.

( ny ) _ * # 1 * ( # 2 ) # 3. the proton carried by a strange quark is described by a three - flavor quark - antiquark strange operator @xcite. this operator is matched to the su(4@xmath1182 ) flavor symmetry that was discussed in ref.@xcite as a possible intermediate state between the lightest quark and the most massive one. the interesting fact is that these two flavors are nearly identical so that a chiral extrapolation can be made. in fact, we find that the three flavors have identical matrix elements, and it is natural to see this as an indication of the compatibility of the fermion sector of the different flavors. this is quite the situation with regard to nucleon matrix elements. after all, the nucleon is a very small effective quantity that is in general uncorrelated with quark level operators and tree - level hadronic operators. it is rather surprising that this chiral situation can persist in the presence of so many light, non - degenerate quarks at nnlo. the main reason is that if one reduces the sea quark masses to those of the valence quarks, chiral dynamics can be recovered in the isospin limit. in principle, this can be done by replacing the seven flavor operators by two isoscalar ones. however, in the real case, it is not possible to do this because of the scale dependence of the counterterms. the phenomenon of scale dependence is, of course, inherent in qcd as the theory is composed of quarks and antiquarks. therefore, a strategy we propose is to perform numerical simulations with an unquenched @x0-_quark _, and two partially - quenchched non - disintegate light quarks. this corresponds to pqqcd with su(5@x082 ) ; we note that this strategy should work quite well for small meson masses, but this is not expected to converge well for matrix elements in nucleons for small enough meson mass, however, it should converge
we investigate the nature of emission in post - starburst galaxies, using the continuum equivalent width ( ew ) and flux / luminosity diagnostics of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). we find that the / ratio is similar for all types of galaxies, but is bimodal among them. blue galaxies are the ones with high / ratio and are actively forming stars, while most red galaxies have low / ratio but are relatively quiescent in terms of star formation. this result has important implications for understanding the coevolution of nuclear black holes and the bulges of galaxies. it is likely that in many star - forming galaxies, the emission - line region is _ not _ associated with star formation, but with other processes. the non - detection of narrow emission lines in spectra of agn probably indicates a different origin for the emission, e.g., active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or type ii qsos. the small / ratio found for blue galaxies probably reflects the presence of a low - level agn, since star formation is most likely suppressed in these objects. if this is the case, it means that the star formation rates in agn are relatively low, probably comparable to, or lower than star formation in galaxies of other types. many blue galaxies contain a young population, which can be explained by a combination of low ew and a low h@xmath0 equivalent width. these young galaxies most likely exhibit type ii morphologies. with the above results, we discuss the typical star formation histories of red galaxies. in particular, we compare the / ratios in the sdss data release four ( *??? * ) with the ratios found in the volume - limited sample of @xmath1-selected galaxies by @xcite. the trends we find are consistent with previous studies in the literature.

we propose a new spectroscopic criterion for selecting galaxies within the redshift range @xmath0 ( actively star - forming or passively evolving ), and use it to distinguish between the two classes. the criterion has been tested empirically using spitzer space telescope imaging of galaxies in the goods region from the k20 survey, and verified with hst / acs photometry from the goods database. the resulting two - color diagram splits galaxies into two distinct regions according to whether they are active or passive. active galaxies are often selected by the application of blue and red colors, respectively, to avoid potential selection biases. passively selected galaxies, on the other hand, are mostly either detected in the uv or optical with blue colors and thus fall below the selection criteria, and thus are not subject to them. we show that a large population of vigorous starburst galaxies with star formation rates ( sfrs ) in excess of 10 mpc@xmath1 yr@xft are found at @xcite, and that their properties are generally consistent with those expected for the precursors of massive spheroids. this is in addition supported by the high stellar - mass distributions, large sizes, merging - like morphologies and strong redshift space spikes. additional evidence for strong clustering comes from the strong correlation between stellar and interstellar metallicity and star - formation rate, and suggests that vigorous starbursts produce a larger fraction of the total star formation rate density at higher redshift. in the context of the starburst / passive dichotomy, vigorous star forming galaxies alone can contribute as much as a factor of 10100 to the sfrd of local early - type galaxies, and can furthermore be identified with the most massive objects in the local universe. in this context, the presence of a significant population of dusty, heavily - reddened galaxies at high redshift can be used to estimate the level of star formation activity in those galaxies, thereby enabling an estimation of the cosmic sfr. we find that the space density of such objects is _ not _ systematically higher than that of passive ones at the same redshift, and is in fact mostly dominated by objects with extremely blue colors. passively - evolving galaxies at lower redshift are almost exclusively found in the high - redshift regime, representing a well - defined but otherwise distinct population of objects coming from the current or imminent wide - area surveys and/or for further cosmological surveys into the nearby universe.
we study the evolution of the comoving infrared energy density with redshift up to @xmath01. this study is based on a sample of 24@xmath1 m - selected sources detected in the chandra deep field south and characterized by photometric redshifts taken from the literature. a companion publication by bell et al. ( 2005 ) explores in more detail the role played by these sources in the decline of the star formation history since reionization of the ir luminosity density implied by the combo-17 catalog. by cross - correlating the catalogs we determine the redshift distribution of the sources and analyze their differential number counts at various redshift limits. this provides new constraints on this kind of scenario, and our results suggest in this case a smooth transition between populations so that continuity is still observed in the total luminosity function. using different libraries of templates published in the literature, we further derive an estimate of the total infrared luminosities of these sources based on our mid - infrared observations. we find that the contribution of infrared luminous sources ( i.e., lirgs and ulirgs ) has a significant impact on the total counts at this redshift, and that such sources dominate the lirg - type population up to reionisation. this result could be due to a complete relaxation of the gravitational potential in high - luminosity star - forming galaxies, perhaps triggered by the expansion of the universe into inhomogeneities with cosmic epoch. we compare our results with predictions from various models of ir galaxy evolution. the cross - correlation results between the number counts and absolute magnitudes as well as the detailed information about the photometrically dominant sources, point to a significant source - formation rate ( sfr ) per unit comoving stellar mass at redshift 0.7. the sfr density is expected to be more than 100 % of the local universe value, which could be achieved with a fainter conversion between infrared and radio luminous galaxies.
inertia gravity ( ig ) waves play an important role in atmosphere - ocean dynamics, due to the cyclonic - anticyclonic asymmetry in the fluid dynamics. however, in geophysically relevant limits, interactions among vortical modes lead to the celebrated quasigeostrophic ( qg ) equations. so far, based on theories based on the interactions of ig modes in isolation, this 3d system can be looked upon as an extension of the 2d stratified problem, which includes the distribution of energy among the wave modes themselves. this dichotomy in the context of purely stratified flows has been pointed out and investigated by waite & bartello ( 2011 ). by retaining only the interactions among the ig modes, we derive a model ( the ggg model ) that consists of only wave - mode interactions, which in principle provides the means for determining the relative importance of wave - vutical - wave and wave - wave interactions for the redistribution of wave energy. specifically, we examine if this model is capable of a robust forward transfer of energy, and compare the energy spectra of wave modes to the corresponding wave mode spectra that arise from the full rotating boussinesq system. we proceed to study the resonant dynamics of this model in certain non - ideal scenarios. i.e., when the mode hierarchy is ( @xmath0 ) consistent with an idealized regime, the inverse parameter is not conserved, and in this case a somewhat dichotomous situation is observed. ii. simulations and the gagg model are studied in a number of different settings. such as when the waves are far from equilibrium and when large - scale damping is important. iii. simulations are performed at finite and finite time scales, and the results are consistent with the expectations from the idealized system. iv. results obtained using @xfig10 are presented first. the full system, forced using method 1, is always identical for the two methods and for theggg model ( full and ggg ). ii
the @xmath0-body problem is a dynamical system on shape space whose motion is controlled by a potential and is subject to linear friction. we reformulate the dynamics as a model of the _ shape _ degrees of freedom and explain why the solutions map into elliptical keplerian motion. the dynamical similarity of the potential - driven motion enables us to eliminate scale from the dynamics. we identify the ` arrows of time'and their relationship to hidden symmetries, groupings and limits of spatial distances. complexity is a prerequisite for storage of information in local subsystems and therefore for the formation of records. we argue that the passage of time is in locally stored records ( including memory ), which, by agreeing with each other, lead us to believe in a dynamological law that generated them from a unique past.

we consider a scenario where gravitational interactions follow a @xmath0 behavior at low energies but are not allowed to transmit quantum information. we characterize the resulting quantum mechanics as a collection of interacting, gravitating particles that are constrained to follow a measure - and - feedback master equation. we show that such a model reproduces the low - energy limit for gravity, given a measured length cutoff and a weak measurement of the potential mass. consequently, we expect an unavoidable noise in observables that do not commute with the set of interactions. we quantify this noise by computing the dephasing rate of a particle evolving under these dynamics. we find that this noise has a magnitude that is about 16 orders of magnitude larger than the planck length, or about 100 gev, a substantially lower energy scale than expected for gravitational physics to emerge. we also calculate the effects of a hypothetical field that stores the mass locally, and respond to the measurement via a back action. interestingly, this field would resemble the master equation seen by diosi, except that it contains an ancillary harmonic oscillator, and is therefore difficult to realize via quantum key distribution. the field we consider has a mass superposition at the second diffraction grating, and we calculate the time evolution of this superposition as a function of the particle s position. we compare our theoretical predictions to the measurements performed on the particle, and conclude that they match the observations. this work represents a new application of gravity in a quantum regime. as a by - product, we demonstrate how a measurement - only quantum theory can emulate a set of pairwise interactions that emulate gravitational wave interactions, and propose a protocol for simulating these interactions in experimentally. quantum entanglement has been a subject of great interest in physics since the early days of quantum gravity @xcite. much effort has been devoted to understanding how a quantum theory could have evolved from the state - of - the - art quantum mechanical description of quantum spacetime in the early universe to our present - day understanding of it. of particular interest is the nonequilibrium, zero - energy physics that might result from the equivalence of quantum and classical space - time, a point of view that has received little attention in the realm of classical communication only theories. from a theoretical perspective, this non - unitary quantum theory of gravity might seem like an extraordinarily rich subject, especially in light of the revolutionary rewards the achievement of in recent years, e.g., supernovae and the observation of gravitational lensing. in this paper, we
in this paper, we study the concept of dissipative behavior in the context of state space systems of dynamical systems ( lti ), using techniques from indefinite linear algebra. a system is called _ controllable _ if for every @xmath0, there exists a storage function that satisfies a dissipation inequality for all system trajectories. in this sense, an lti system is a ` dense'in the set of all allowed trajectories : the compact support signifying that we calculate the ` net power'transferred when the system starts ` from rest'and ` ends at rest '. we elaborate more on this point when we define dissipative systems. we formulate a new definition of dissipativity for systems, possibly uncontrollable, and present several results using certain properties of matrices that are self - adjoint with respect to an _ indefinite _ inner product. in particular, we show that if the uncontrollable poles are not mixed ( i.e., there are no two of them added to zero ), then the dissipative of the controlled system is equivalent to the system s dissipative. this is an important qualitative result : the solution to the dissipation lmi is sufficient for maintaining controllability. we also show that, using the concatenability axiom of the state, the energy stored in the a priori non - deterministic state is a static function of the variables. further, we also investigate dependencies on a latent variable, or on a state variable, and show that this state is ` observable'from the external variables. what happens for uncontrollable systems is more complicated. we consider two examples when all the states of the system are uncontrollable. in these situations, we find that the input - cardinality condition is not satisfied : we lose track of the largest possible power, even if the input and the output are mutually positive. this naturally leads to the question of whether dissipative behaviors are of the same sign as their non - dissipative counterparts.
we use the model of cool pervading the gould belt to discuss the reasons why young, radio - quiet infrared ( ins ) neutron stars ( nss ) are not detected by rosat and other space missions, and why the paucity of accreting inss is still unexplained. we stress that inss spend most of their lives in the phase of accretion and usually they are _ ejectors _ since their magnetic moment is too low to allow accretion. however, not all inss that are born in the disk to become accretors will pass through the stage of radio pulsars, and we discuss the possible reasons for this fact. we mainly concentrate on the case of a particular class of inss, the ` ` magnificent seven ''. radio quiet nss are assumed to be born very close to the magnetic axis in a compact object ( a radio pulsar ). we find that the seven rosat inss are all very young ( @xmath0 myr ) and have properties quite distinct from those of old, radio loud nss. therefore, we conclude that not more than several tens of nss in future can be identified with rosat data at low galactic latitudes, some of them being among the most luminous and radio quiet objects known. we also discuss the four basic stages in the evolution of a nss : ejector stage, propeller stage ( formed when the magnetic field is strong enough to make the star shine in soft x - rays, and the critical period ), transition to the _ georotator _ stage ( when matter can penetrate inside the light cylinder ), and _ coolers _ stage, characterized by low - temperature surface emission. of course, these stages are affected by the flux limits of the instruments on board rosat, but they are by no means unique. we argue on the one hand that the observations will favor the hypothesis that most coolers are in fact ejectors and that the presence of coolers is due to internal mechanisms ( magnetic polarization, synchrotron radiation,... ) and/or ram pressure effects. on the other hand we show that the emission of our hypothetical inss can be detected by new x - ray telescopes, including agile, perrot, and grenier, and some of the new missions, if they probe a region of the galactic disk which could be accessible during the next three years.
we present a model for galaxy formation in hierarchical clustering that allows the light of a galaxy to be split into two components : a disk and a bulge. we use this model to examine the systematics of bulge formation and the morphological mix in clusters and the evolution of the luminosity function as a function of redshift. in our model, all galaxies initially form stars in a disk as hot virialised gas cools onto a collapsed dark matter halo. we assume that the timescale for star formation is longer than the collapse timescale of the gas. spheroidal distributions of stars and galactic bulges can only form as the outcome of merger events. we compare the predictions of our model with observations in the @xmath0, standard cold dark matter model, in order to understand the basis of a broad morphological classification based upon the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio. whilst the colours of galaxies of different types at low and high redshift are similar in spirit, there are differences in the way that galaxies form stars quiescently in the disk until a merger disrupts them. violent mergers are accompanied by a burst of star formation that adds further stars to the disk. we show that the bulges of spirals are assembled before the spheroids of cluster ellipticals and that bright ellipticals were assembled before field ellipticals. we find agreement between our model predictions and the colour - magnitude diagram of bright elliptical galaxies except at the faint end of the redshift function. the intrinsic scatter in colour of bright galaxies can not be traced back to a single parameter in the mass of cold gas in clusters. the flat slope of the relation between galaxy luminosity and rest frame colour is a result of the combination of a small disk radius and a large scatter in star formation rate. if the galaxy merger timescale is shorter than the life of the halo, the galaxies can merge before the end of their evolution. galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : evolution galaxies : formation methods : statistical
we study the properties of two- and three - dimensional finite - time lyapunov exponents that describe the time evolution of infinitesimal elements of phase space in dynamical systems with a time - asymptotic singularity. these properties are described by differential geometry, and are related to the diffeomorphism from lagrangian coordinates to eulerian coordinates. we consider a prescribed smooth dynamical system, whose solution of the equations of motion is a smooth coordinate transformation from the set of initial conditions ( which label fluid elements ) to the state of the system at a later time, extending the work of tang and boozer [ phys. rev. e * 81 *, 041302 ( 2011 ) ]. the aim is to compute the riemann curvature tensor, which characterizes the flatness of the space after a smooth transformation, in the basis of a rigid body. we use curvature as a geometrical property and determine the corresponding equation of state. for a chaotic flow, we find that, in addition to the vanishing of the ricci tensor for nonchaotic cases, a new constraint must be satisfied in three dimensions. we study this constraint in detail, and then use it to compare our results with numerical simulations on two - dimensional convection rolls. in two dimensions, the effects of the constraint are analytically understood in terms of what we call _ curvature balance _, that is, the fact that the stable manifold closest to each point in an ergodic region comes close to every point in a fluctuating chaotic flow. when the flow is chaotic, these terms imply exponential separation of neighboring trajectories, which is a property of the chaotic region, and not of the smooth system. numerical simulations support our theoretical conclusions. we also examine the applications of the constraints, and propose anuristic methods of computing some of them. the results are relevant to fluid dynamics and plasma physics, and to the description of transport in chaotic mixing.
the second in a series of papers on the structure of the magellanic clouds uses data from the near - infrared 2mass and denis surveys to investigate the lmc. the data from these surveys are used to create _ projected _ color - magnitude diagrams of the galaxy on the projected plane of the sky. the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) is used to define the major axis position angle, @xmath0, while the denis survey provides the data for the star count contours. the latter are combined with positional information from the 2mass survey to define a projected grid of approximately 18,000 stars. the photometric and kinematic data for all three surveys are analyzed in a similar way to previous work, using a variety of tracers in an lmc disk ( rgb, asymptotic giant branch, and red giant branch stars ). the position angle and ellipticity values for the disk are determined by using the viewing angles from the previous work. the 3-dimensional projected number density distribution of stars in the rgb and agb lines show considerable variations as function of radius. at small radii the data shows a drift in the contour center around the center that is entirely due to the milky way tidal force, and is not centered on the center of the bar. at large radii, the effect of viewing perspective ( the centroid of stars being closer to us than the other ) is the dominant source of drift. the inner regions of the contours show large variations in the apparent magnitude of features, with peak - to peak amplitudes of up to 3.5 mag. the luminosity density of agb stars is well fitted by an exponential disk with scale length of 840 pc, but the data do not provide conclusive support for an exponential profile. the disk is not circular, but elongated. the elongation is most likely the result of tidal forces from the solar system, in conjunction with the tidal force from the smc ; the latter is indicated by the large and systematic difference in stellar mass traced by the two surveys.

we introduce the notion of geometric phase deficit as a method to detect macroscopic entanglement. it is shown that the difference of geometric phases acquired by the composite system during a non - cyclic evolution in separable states can be used to uniquely characterize the quantum state. in particular, if a nonzero value of this ratio is zero then the composite state is not a product state and can be considered as a real manifold of dimension @xmath0. we illustrate this method with the example of superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable coherent states using a microwave cavity with a superconducting charge qubit. quantum interferometry plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of light. much like its classical counterpart, the quantum mechanical interferometric technique has been recently revolutionized to the point of becoming a powerful tool to detect quantum correlations even in the absence of any external magnetic field @xcite. the use of quantum correlations in the quantum theory is fundamental and has been studied for a long time. a quantum state can be represented as a set of points in a projective hilbert space and evolves under suitable time - dependent hamiltonian. even in a separable state, the geometric phase difference during the evolution can be interpreted as a quantum correlation. the quantum correlations can be seen as a manifestation of the total quantum correlations. however, it has been argued that only the local geometric phase, which is a nonmonotonic and non - factorizable quantity, can be captured by this concept. in this paper, we show that a nonphysical quantity can be detected using the technique. we introduce the idea that the ratio of the local relative phase shift to the global geometric phase is a signature of multipartite mixed quantum states. more precisely, for a bipartite state, if one considers a system of local subsystems which evolves under a noncyclic process, then the system possesses non - zero geometric phase gap between the local and global estimates of the system parameters. thus, by suitably tuning the parameters in the evolution path, one can directly measure the entanglements with the help of non - bell - type linear optics. this is the first non - trivial way to detect the quantum entangled state. the idea can be also applied to multi - particle systems. especially, the finite - temperature superposition of coherent states has been shown to be a reliable method to generate the superposition state of a system. the superpose state is described by the geometric - phase - deficit(es ) for macrosc
according to planet formation models, a significant amount of mass was left in leftover planetesimals at the end of the giant impact phase in the terrestrial planet region following the largest lunar breakup. geochemical evidence suggests that a total of about @xmath0 of this mass was accreted following the epoch of giant impacts, where the earth, moon and mars formed part of a permanent lunar crust. we show here that small residual or ` late'veneer particles can provide the dynamical friction needed to damp the high eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets after giant impacts so that they can remain in stable orbits and thus provide the momentum to dissipate the planetesimal s velocity dispersion by mutual collisions. we find that for the earth - moon system, the best accretion timescale that can be achieved is long compared to the tidal evolution timescale of the earth and moon, which implies that the terrestrial - moon separation was already achieved when giant impacts begin. due to the high degree of mixing of highly siderophile elements ( hses ) in the lunar crust, about 50 % of the total mass in the earth s crust was initially delivered to the earth plus the moon before giant impacts. we calculate the accretion cross section for the planets accretion material and find that it is significantly enhanced by gravitational focusing above their geometric values, which suggests that the mass added to the moon, the mars and the earth during the giant impacts was much less than the sum of the masses transferred to earth and the moon. using this explanation for the observed in the hse abundances, we show that the observed ratio of earth to mars accretion is consistent with the mass accretion ratio earth / mars, which is low only if about 0.3 - 0.7 of its total mass was delivered as early as 8 billion years ago. this suggests that about 40 - 50% of the extra mass in leftover material between 8 and 1000 km / s may have been delivered as late veneser to earth, the majority of which may still be around. we also find that the abundance of siderophilic elements ( with higher abundance in protoplanets and smaller radii ) has been attributed to the presence of a population of small planetesimovites that reside in gaps that will form when the lunar mantle is formed.

in the basic probabilistic two states opinion model, members of the community are randomly distributed among groups of various sizes according to some probability distribution, and within each group all members adopt one of the possible opinions with a certain probability. the members then determine their opinion according to the l.m.r., and subsequently change to become a floater ( not necessarily a contrarian ) for the alternative opinion they initially was supporting. the presence of contrarians for each opinion is quantitatively expressed as a fixed fraction of the density of _ local attractors _ of the respective opinion. in the basic deterministic two state opinion model,the number of members of each group is fixed, and inflexible, while non - contrarian, contrarian opinion supporters are assumed to be randomly distributed over all possible groups of a fixed size. for both opinions there is no majority in each group. if there is a tie in the groups of size 2, the opinion which originally has the majority eventually will be redistributed to the other opinion with the smaller fraction of supporters. in case of a tie, the population of supporters of one opinion will be divided into two distinct groups, and each group will have a local majority rule applied to it, with the final majority opinion being chosen according to its local attractor. we study the qualitative characteristics of the opinion dynamics generated by repeated updates of the two opinions. in particular we study changes in the number of equilibria, and changes from monotone to alternating dynamics, due to changes in parameter combinations. a detailed mathematical treatment of the generated opinion dynamics, for groups of arbitrary size, is given. to add more realism to opinion models, in this paper we incorporate, by means of several recent voting events ( the u.s.a. poll results, the hung elections outcomes, and various other recent theoretical events ) the effects of inflexibility and contrarians in political games, in which one opinion ( the @xmath0 opinion ) dominates the other. we restrict ourselves to groups of at most 3 members and consider the case where both opinions are present in a given group with fixed size 3. it is shown that for a group of size 1, inflexibles only influence the dynamics of the group in a small way, and in particular in a regime in which the functioning of the groups is controlled by a local attractionor.
we study the energy generated by an energy harvesting device attached to a vibrating source. the vibrations of the moving magnets are treated by stochastic kinetic excitation. the results we obtained are compared with a purely harmonic case. the bistable character of the system is achieved by the relatively small distance between the moving and stable magnets. the increase of the distance improves the efficiency of the device. especially in the low frequency regime we observed substantial growth of the generated mean power. the device could be operated in the linear regime ( when the vibrations are @xmath0 ), while the range of the output power for the high frequency case was limited to a small degree. the result presented here can be used in a situation of the rotating car wheel on an uneven road, or the helicopter rotor blades rotating in randomly changing engine conditions. marco scutari and carol parati, ` ` magnetism and the flow of matter, '' rev. mod. phys. * 81 *, 10411043 ( 2008 ). j. b. pendry, d. e. harvester, and m. a. konacki ` ` nonlinear response of magnetic fields to small perturbations, '' progress in applied physics * 54 *, 281 ( 2009 ). l. garrido - da - silva, f. dell osservatorio, m. uiberacker, s. silva - baltuska, and f. c. crespo ` ` bose - einstein condensation of helium in a classical fluid, '' phys. rev. lett. * 85 *, 213901 ( 1999 ). b. j. ehlers, p. wasylczyk, a. bjarklev, t. rasmussen, and j. d. joannopoulos ` ` simple mechanical oscillators for micro- and nano - electro - mechanical systems, '' nature * 462 *, 7477 ( 2012 ). s. franke - arnold, l. bergt, b. weise, and p. m. zoeller ` ` coupling of single - walled carbon nanotubes to simple all - to - all magnetic oscillators, '' j. phys. b : at. mol. opt. * 37 *, 848854 ( 2007 ). g. grzegorov, g. mironov, i. milostnaya, v.m. konakovskii, and yu
we report the results of a search for x - ray forest absorption by and associated lines in a 470 ksec observation of h1821 + 643, a quasar at @xmath0. this is the most direct evidence to date for a low density, shock - heated intergalactic medium ( whim ) that is thought to contain a significant fraction of the ` ` ` missing '' low redshift baryons. using a combination of _ chandra _ and _ fuse _ observations, we find two strong absorption features at 21.0 and 21.8 that could correspond to and absorption by highly ionized oxygen. the lower limits on the column densities of the absorbers indicate that they are photoionized and that their gas densities are significantly below those expected in virialized structures like groups or clusters. from the measured line densities, we determine that and are associated with absorbers. if the absorber is a physical system, then our measurements imply that the baryon density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis and the estimated primordial deuterium abundance are several times higher than the values implied by leading cosmological models, and it probably requires that the frequency of such enriched regions be at least an order of magnitude higher than current models of the universe. we also find absorption at the redshift of the strongest candidate systems. a comparison of the observed features with those predicted by hydrodynamic simulations shows that absorbers could produce equivalent widths of and lines at the expected wavelengths of and. however, the theoretical expectations for absorption at these wavelengths are about a factor of 10 below the observed line density in most of the systems. we find that for and there is no evidence for absorption above the expected wavelength of absorption for another, but there is a trend for the line density to decrease with increasing column density. our results imply that if absorbers contain the majority of the missing low z@xmath1baryons, and are responsible for the high column density and low density of the whim, then typical absorbers should contain a relatively high fraction ( at least 30 - 50 % ) of the rest - frame uv - quiet baryonic content of the igm.
we present new abundances and gradients for 28 m - giants located in the inner 300 pc of the milky way bulge. the stars were observed at high spectral resolution with the high resolution crires spectrograph on the vlt, in order to avoid the extreme visual extinction in the k band. we determine the abundances of the @xmath0 elements mg and si for all our sources, which to our knowledge have not really been done before. the luminosity and temperature ranges of our stars in the galactic center and the other two fields are within a factor of 3 of each other. the k - band stellar abundances are found to be constant with metallicities ranging from [ fe / h]@xmath1 to slightly sub - solar values. the [ mg / fe ] and [ si/fe ] abundances as a function of metallicity show similar trends, in the ` outer'bulge and at lower latitudes, with the exception of the metal - rich component, which is almost homogeneous. we also report the results of galactic chemical evolution modelling. with our new abundance ratios, we show that the inner bulge extends farther in the way as far as we can measure it, i.e. we can conclude that the bulge, within a projected distance of 300 pc, is an inside - out formation with an initial collapse. no spatial abundance gradient is found in our bulge stars, apart from the one thin disk star bd-012971, which extends more than two orders of magnitude further out than the average outbursts in the other fields. we performed a similar analysis in the stellar substructure, using the kinematics and photometry as well as the chemical evolution models. we find that the star formation efficiency, the fraction of iron locked into dust, and the efficiency of star formation are all at the level of 100 % for the whole bulge region. we conclude that, from a chemical viewpoint, our results are compatible with the scenario of early star formation and strong homogeneity of the galactic chemical enrichment.

the formation of non - isentropic entropy layers in metallic foils is studied on the basis of dislocation plasticity model. the entropy jump and the strain rate on its front are determined by the hugoniot relation as well as the elastic moduli of the material. non - uniform distribution of entropy and temperature at interfaces are obtained analytically. the effects of viscosity and plasticity are statistically significant. high - entropy layer formation at the plate impact and low - entropy one at the ramp loading are both explained by the same physical process. kevnikov - kovchakov equation of state of matter at zero temperature is used to describe the physical process of deformation. the physical reason of formation of such layer is that it affects the radiative processes of substance formation near the impact surface, which can be very different from the effect of heat conduction. that causes the plasticity effects. meanwhile, the kinetics of dislocations and plastic deformation are essential for the observed thin foils, such as used in experiments. = 0.3 cm department of physics, univ. of california, davis, ca 95616 - 8677, usa solid state with strong dissipation, uniaxial compression, and thermodynamic state is a new paradigms, now being applied to a wide variety of problems, from fusion reactions to thermodynamics. in this paper, we focus on a simple mechanical process, which is equivalent to the injection of a fluid through a solid body, and calculate the resulting viscous strain rate and its thickness for a slab of solid metal. this process is non - equilibrium and leads to different entropy structures in the matter than the injection. because of this, one has to pay attention to details of the process in order to be able to discriminate between the physical and the numerical effects. in the mean field approximation, the velocity field is represented by a mesh of mesh size @xmath0 m and the pressure is calculated from the mean - field distribution obtained by the convolution of the velocity and the shear stress on the mesh size.
we present detailed calculations of dynamical structure and morphologies of star forming galaxies at redshift @xmath0, by including feedback of star formation in the dynamics of the gaseous disk. we assume that exciting turbulence excited by supernova explosion of massive stars is driving the angular momentum outward, and the mass dropout is happening due to ongoing star formation. the role of supernova - driven turbulence is not favored by evidence that such flows are not able to produce the dispersion and emission via mergers. however, the present model, which focuses on triggering the star formation through the exciting turbulence, is more well - suited for the dynamical evolution of galaxies than studies on the coevolution of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) or the growth of bulges at high@xmath1. for the star - forming galaxies bx 389 and bx 482, which have a similar morphology, we find that their dynamical structures are driven by turbulent viscosity driven by snexp. the first ring has been immigrated into the bulge, where it is still growing. the second ring, which is at the inner radius of the first conical ring, has already gained much mass and is rapidly growing, with a time delay of roughly 3.5 gyr. we follow the evolution of the inner region of the galaxy and find that it is self - gravity dominated. on the other hand, the outer region where the gas is moving out and the turbulence is suppressed is well fitted by the time - dependent star formation law, if the density is proportional to the velocity dispersion. both rough estimates and numerical estimates show that the current star formation rate is larger than the rate of formation of primordial gas, implying that there is more gas to be accreted from the disk into bulge at the present time. the present results can be useful for the formation of new galaxies or as a tool to understand the cosmic growth process.
we introduce a novel distributed device detection scheme for large - scale _ machine - to - machine _ ( m2 m ) communication networks based on the _ compressed sensing _ ( cs ) techniques for dealing with high - dimensional signals with a sparse representation, where signal acquisitions can be done in a significantly reduced sampling rate. the proposed scheme targets to cope with the tremendous scaling issues aroused by the massive connectivity in m2 - m communication networks, thereby achieving higher detection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional schemes like lte ra procedure and classic cluster - based access approaches. as the crucial ingredient for the successful implementation of the proposed approach, we first apply the cs theory to the _ block sketching _ and _ orthogonal matching pursuit _ ( omp ) algorithms for decoding at the base station ( bs ) and derive the optimal algorithms for reconstructing the device signature from the received signal assuming the devices have been detected and detected in each cluster, where the device detection and resource allocation strategies are accordingly adjusted accordingly. in particular, the receiver device activations are mapped into the recovery procedure of such a sparse signal, thus leading to a significant reduction in the device acquisition time. moreover, the existing cs decoding algorithms for the bs based on conventional greedy algorithms such as _ iterative hard thresholding _ ( iht ) and _ fixed intercepting streams _ ( fibrations ) are accordingly modified to overcome the block sparsity issue due to the massive number of devices. theoretical analysis presents a rigorous proof of theorem [ theorem_1 ], which provides a sufficient condition for performance guarantees by the proposed distributed device detected devices detection scheme to be reliably reconstructed with much less computational complexity compared with existing standard decoding algorithms. furthermore, it is shown that the blocking or filtering procedures can be significantly simplified in terms of the performance robustness and efficiency, thus resulting in a much better scaling performance with respect to the existing methods. finally, numerical results are also presented and evaluated. compressed sensing, device detection, distributed device discovery, resource allocation, internet of things, internet - of - things
we consider a model for the production of primordial density perturbations in the universe during inflation. in this model the preheat inflaton fields are broken by breaking the symmetry between them, either during or after inflation. we consider three different models, with different potentials and interaction terms. the first two models break the symmetry during inflation and generate the primordial curvature perturbation. the third model does not. we calculate the non - gaussianity of this model and compare it to other models of inflation with symmetric preheating. # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3)(#1,_#2)#3phys. lett. b * # 1 * ( # 2 ) # 3 phys. rev. * d#1'# 2. astron. soc. pacific * version 5 ( # 7 ) # 1astrophys. j/98102503:arxiv:9810.0438 [ cols= " < ", ] computations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies show that the scalar field fluctuations during inflation are very large, with a factor of a few larger than those during the early epochs of cosmic inflation. this leads to strong constraints on the parameters of the model, which must be parametrized in a manner that does not depend on the energy scale of the universe. in particular for the geometrically light model ( gmrt ), the effective mass of the inflaton field is predicted to be @xmath0 @xcite, whereas the adiabatic field is expected to be close to unity at hubble exit. this simple constraint on the model parameters can be extended if the model includes some light scalar fields during inflation, which is what should be done in models with a non - canonical kinetic term in the background lagrangian. this extra term may well be relevant in the dynamical evolution of the expanding universe. however it is unlikely that the model described so far gives a good fit to the observations. because the model considered does not have the required energy scale then observations of the perturbed universe must be supplemented with models which have a period of inflation which differs from the one considered in this paper. the aim of this paper is to look for a model which can be approximated sufficiently by the current standard model and which also has the required scale of inflation. for this purpose we use the framework of the ` ` separate universes '' approach @
this paper summarizes recent results on application of the floquet - lippmann - schwinger ( fws - andreev ) viewpoint to two- and three - terminal josephson junctions. the paper is based on the recent results obtained by the weizmann group on a set - up consisting of a quantum dot with a superconducting point contact ( qp ) in a phase - biased two - terminal superconductor ( two fermions per dot, one qp and one incommensurate point contact ). two low - energy ( three - level ) resonances in the current due to the nonlinear decoupling of the two loop self - consistent loop on the bare quasiparticle populations of the quantum dot are considered. floquet theory ( green s function theory ) is implemented as band theory combined with resummed perturbation theory in the strong coupling @xmath0 between the dot and the electrons, to obtain the four - level wave - functions and associated populations. at the same time, a nonstandard generalized dynes - nordstrm hamiltonian is introduced to describe the resonance energy spectrum. it is found that for a fws band, the bandwidth is proportional to the number of fermionic bands, and the spectrum is characterized by a power law in the allowed region of the bandwidth, with the spectral line - width increasing exponentially in the transverse direction. an expression for the fws ladders of resonances ( which are no longer fermi liquid and, therefore, nonequilibrium dc - current ladders ) is obtained within a few lines of calculations from bohr - sommerfeld ( see, e.g., van houwelingen et al. @xcite ). based on this observation, a generalization to arbitrary double quantum dot sets - ups is proposed. similar types of set - ups are expected also in the forthcoming cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments. resonant double quantum dots or, alternatively, single quantum dots formed in carbon nanotubes or in semi - conducting quantum wires. keywords : floquet, floquet current, bose - einstein condensation, superconductivity, three - dimensional superconductors, integer quantization

we analyse the analysis of cascaded brillouin generation in optical fibres. in the context of a fabry - perot cavity and ring resonator. we demonstrate that if there is only a single acoustic wave propagating in each direction down the fibre then the system must be driven by multiple sets of interacting optical fields. this has important implications for the derivation of the standard coupled amplitude equations that are used to analyse these systems. we note that the recent analysis by ogusu @xcite is based on an incorrect assumption that all acoustic fields are time - independent and that any analysis that begins with such a set of equations is wrong. the difference between the two sets of equations must therefore be investigated carefully. we present a detailed analysis of this difference and show that it is possible to decouple the propagating acoustic wave from the group velocity of the electric field and thus to derive the correct set of power equations for the fields without making the analysis dependent on the time - dependence of the fields. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 0=0 1= 1=1 0>1 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 1| # 2| # 3 * # 4 * # 1(#1 ) # 2 = 0_#2^#3 ^#1 # 2 -0.55em.3ex.3ex # 1@xmath0 # 1 m_#1^#2 # 1o # 1 = 6em 1em 1 # 1c ( # 1,#2 ) # 1;#2;#3;#4;#5 # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5 # 1;;#2 ;#3 c # 1 ( # 2 ) # 3 ( # 4 ) # 5.7ex pacs number(s ) : 42.50.mv ; 42.52.+r ; 03.90.+e # 1 introduction ------------ recently there has been a large amount of progress on several fronts. in developing the theory and implementation of resonator driven systems it has been possible to use any number of techniques to accelerate the pump to high luminosity pulses and thus increase the number of photons transmitted through the cavity. one particular technique is the use of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ). in such a device the resonator acts as a narrowband source and as soon as the cavity is half filled the power of the pump is
we consider a molecule with two non - degenerate electron - acceptor orbitals coupled strongly to an internal vibration in the limit of weak tunneling to electrodes. the non - equilibrium effect due to the interplay of the vibration - assisted tunneling and the coulomb blockade is analyzed. we show that the weak non - linear current is generated at resonance lines where an electron can tunnel off the molecule. the current may even become amplified by strong relaxation depending on the electron - vibration couplings and applied voltages. a weak ndc effect is found at the first resonance lines when the energy is _ weakly _ coupled to the vibration. this effect is suppressed when the two coupling energies are equal however. in general the feedback mechanism is shown to be active when the vibrational excitations are populated by the competing orbitals. we also present results for cases of moderate asymmetry of the couplings where such effects may start to play a role. molecular electronic properties have been the focus of considerable research efforts in the last years. these studies aim to characterize the electronic characteristics of molecules in the context of potentials which relate to nuclear activity. these potentials arise when a neutral molecule is exposed to the cross section of an active vibrational mode which is either energetically or vibrationally excited. the occupied vibrational state leads to a current drop below the resonance which signals the _ stopping _ of the motion. in the case of a strong interaction the energy of the excited state accumulates on the neutral state resulting in a _ blocking _ effect which is not observed in the full energy spectrum of the molecule ( cf. ref. ). since these effects are expected to be particularly strong for many - particle states of molecules which are characterized to a good approximation by occupation of a particular orbital @xcite, the presence of a blocking state is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the operation of the relevant transport mechanism. thus a mechanism must be in place to fully activate the resulting feedback mechanism. while most studies have focused on the effects of a vibrational blockade on the current, there is now increasing evidence that also causes a suppression of the current. we now prove an important restriction of the occurrence of ndc by considering a configuration of molecular - exchange energies which may be induced by a dissipative environment.
we present emission line number densities, emission line ratios, and luminosity functions from 29 fields from the on - going infrared spectroscopic parallels ( wisp ) survey, taken with both the g102 and g141 grism filters. the wisp survey is sensitive to emitters down to @xmath0=0.3, with a typical redshift of 0.10.2. in our final sample of emission line galaxies, we detect 996 sources and [ oiii ] in 280 galaxies, with the majority of the detections being due to overlapping bright source spectra. we derive an average 0.7@xmath1[o iii ] flux density of 2.6 ergs / s which is roughly five times lower than the expected contamination from overlapping sources. the ratios of the bright / faint lines are comparable, suggesting that the emission lines are not co - spatial over a large fraction of the survey area. we require the emission line region to be spatially extended in order to achieve an accurate redshift estimate. contamination from nearby overlapping spectra also limits the effectiveness of automatic line finding algorithms, and results in emission lines that are lost altogether. for the higher resolution g102 grism, we find that only 0.1 % of the emission is lost. we present the luminosity function, which is dominated by the bright lines and has a slope of -1.8 between 0.3 and 3.0. it is not well constrained due to the small number of bright emission lines we present. however, we note that it might be useful in the future for _ euclid _ and _ wfirst _ to have a near - infrared counterpart to estimate the fluxes of galaxies. in either case, we emphasize the need for very high spatial resolution in both grism and emission line surveys to achieve the required level of accuracy for baryonic acoustic oscillation experiments. we provide examples of regions where this type of resolution is needed.
we present a systematic pixel analysis of the interacting face - on spiral galaxy, ngc 5194, using the photometric pixel cell code, _ hst_/acs. the main goal is to improve the understanding of properties of the galaxy using pixel analysis methods and to establish the pcmd analysis methods for future photometric studies of galaxies. we found that the pixel color - magnitude relation ( pcmd ) can be used as a morphology indicator of the star - forming area around young and old stars, respectively. the slope of the blue / red pixel sequence ( @xmath0 ) is inversely proportional to the optical magnitude, which can be inversely applied as an optical indicator of dust content for galaxies without ir information. other physical parameters such as the color offset and the luminosity - weighted mean stellar age of the pixel sequence, the estimated dust - to - gas mass ratio and the star formation rate per unit stellar mass mass vary according to the color variations in the blue and red pixel sequences. however, those parameters need to be carefully taken into account using a large sample of galaxies, because the quality of the data in the current resolution range is not sufficient to distinguish between different galaxies. by using the pixel cut - off scale and the observed surface brightness variations, we were able to break the degeneracy between galaxy type and stellar age, and thus establish the age - metallicity degeneracy for young stellar populations. the faint end of the bright - end pixel sequence shows a distinct spiral arm pattern, which is in good agreement with the spiral arm patterns in the early - type galaxy, while that of the old population shows a degeneracy with the bulge area. we also found that there are some ` plume'features running from the red sequence to the redder domain, which are probably caused by the presence of dust in the innermost region of the disk and spiral arms. our analysis results will be useful for quantitative comparisons of pcmds of galaxies with different infrared ( ir ) imaging instruments and for establishing the method of pixel analysis for star formation in galaxies.

we have retrieved a _ hubble space telescope _ image of the nearby galaxy 3c 318. this object is at a redshift of @xmath0 and was previously considered by many to be a quasar. the total flux and size are consistent with those expected for a radio source at the same redshift. the hst image shows no clear excess over the extrapolation of the radio sed. thus we can be confident that the high far - infrared luminosity is not due to beamed synchrotron radiation. we had searched for weak mgii and [ oii ] emission, which are often used to identify quasars, but only detected an excess above the continuum expected from a pure starburst. we conclude that the bulk of the sub - mm emission can be accounted for by massive starbursts, unless these objects also have a very high fraction of obscured agn. we show that models of agn dust tori can account for the observed iso and scuba fluxes if the following properties are assumed : ( a ) the dust is distributed in an extended torus / disk with a scale radius of about 10 kpc from the quasar, ( b ) the equivalent width of the h@xmath1 emission line is correlated with the projection of the dust in the torus, ( c ) the cold dust is heated by a massive starburst, which obviously requires the presence of a bright quasar nucleus in order to heat the cool dust and ( d ) the starburst is probably triggered by triggering and fueling. we discuss the implications of our findings for the population of high - redshift radio galaxies detected at sub - millimeter wavelengths. # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 1 # 1 to size # 1 = cmr10 scaled1 = cmti10 scaled 1 = cmbx10 scaled 110 # 1 cosmology : observations galaxies : active galaxies : seyfert infrared : galaxies
the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) remnant sn 2000cx was observed with the vlt / uves and eso / ntt / nicmos on july 23, 2000, less than 48 hours before maximum. in this paper we report on early time ( @xmath0 days before maximum ) optical spectroscopy of the supernova. the low dispersion spectrum obtained at about one week before maximum shows the presence of broad, unblended interstellar absorption lines of hydrogen, helium and possibly helium. the equivalent widths of these lines are similar to that of the absorption lines observed towards sn 2006x by marietta et al. ( 2000 ). we have studied the possible effects of circumstellar gas in our early time spectra by comparing the line profiles with models of what would be expected for a non - degenerate progenitor system interacting with the ejecta from a single ia. to constrain the circumstellar density and the amount of ejected hydrogen - rich material we have performed detailed photoionization calculations using the kolmogorov - smirnov test code. we find that while the protons in the protoplanetary nebula would easily be stripped at maximum, the likely amount of the stripped material at the shock front is much less. if the ejected material is ionized and dense enough, it could reveal itself in the form of narrow emission lines in the nebular phase of a tentative wind, which may be detectable in the mid - infrared spectrum two years after maximum. we also present an analysis of the early time photometry of sn 2001el. the line profile of this supernova shows clear variations depending on the time of observation. of particular emphasis is the ca ii ir triplet at 3.6 days after maximum which is the first observational evidence for possible circumstellar interaction between sn ejecta and its companion star. comparing our line profile with that of sn 2011fe in the recurrent nova system rs oph, we conclude that at least some circumstellar material is piling up at the position where the supernovae explode. the lack of line absorption signatures, however, rules out an evolutionary scenario where the sn is not a single degenerate, but rather a double degenerate object.
the mid - infrared spectra of a wide variety of objects, including regions, post - agb stars, pne, young stellar objects and galaxies are dominated by emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2 and 12.7 @xmath0 m. the unidentified infrared features ( uirs ) at longer wavelengths are often cited as the carriers of these features which can be excited to very high ` ` temperatures '' in such cold environments upon absorption of a single fuv photon. however, the relative strength of the uir features varies from source to source and this provides a tool to determine the characteristics of the emitting population and, eventually, to study the physical conditions in the emitting regions. many studies have attempted to solve pieces of this puzzle and here we review the progress made in the observational domain since the launch of the infrared space observatory ( iso ). iso observations reveal that the main uir feature spectrum is made up of a rich collection of features which vary in intensity, peak position and profile. these variations trace the states of the main emission modes. in particular, the variations in the relative strengths of the 7.6 and 7.8 @xfig0 m features, whose relative strengths vary with the distance between sources, reflect the different physical conditions that prevail in these regions. in addition to providing tools to probe the local universe, these variations also reveal some of the limitations of previous studies of this type. we discuss the implications of these results within the framework of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) model and show that the observed variations in relative strength can be used to determine, in a quantitative way, the charge balance, and accordingly the evolutionary state of these small molecules. address = istituto di astrofisica spaziale e fisica cosmica, via u. la malfa 153, i-90146 palermo, italy address = institut fr astronomie und astrophysik, universitt wrzburg, campus hubland, emil - fischer - str. 31, d-97074 wrzberg, germany address = department of physics,oka state university, 1 - 1 oho, tokyo 181 - 8551, japan address = nasa goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 20771, usa
water shows anomalies in density, diffusion and structure. the behaviour of isotropic potentials with a repulsive soft - core, either a ramp or a shoulder, have anomalies in the radial distribution function @xmath0 that are similar to those of water. we show that these anomalies are due to the continuous change of the slope of the shoudered well potential ( csw ) with increasing density and pressure. for a chosen value of the csw potential, the regions of density and diffusion anomaly shrink as they would disappear, and the anomalies become narrower as the density or pressure is increased. in silica, the structural anomaly is responsible for a temperature - dependent change in the maximum density, while for oxygen the region of maximum density appears only at the point of the discontinuous shouldered well ( dsw ) potential. we discuss the significance of our results for the glassy properties of water and suggest that it could be used as a screening method to detect anomalies in otherwise normal liquids. * date : * 05.05.ml, 05.45.df, 03.65.+h, 89.80.-k, 95.30.+s, 05/05 + july 2006 + * anomalies in water and silica potentials * + j.d. martin@xmath1, h.j. lezec@xcite, c.h. brouri@xfig.com, j.p. rauschenberger institut fr physik, universitt erlangen - nrnberg, d-70550 bamberg, germany. + e.s. barnes et al. @xcite study the origin of the ` ` structural anomaly '' in water, i.e. the occurrence of a region of density anomalies in normal liquids, by calculating the translational and the orientational order parameters of the system. they find that normal liquids exhibit a spatial order parameter that increases with increasing pressure and density, and a difussion region of structure that includes the density anomaly region. here we study for which case the structure does not change, while the normal liquid has the same structure as the dsw. we perform a systematic study in this respect in order to understand in a systematic way how the anomalies depend on the parameter that controls the softness of the potential. moreover, we also perform a correlation between the changes of the coordination shells of the distribution ( e.g. the second virial coefficient ) and the appearence of the anomalies.

we state the problem of the inventory of isolated overdense regions of the virialized cosmic matter distribution in a non - gaussian random field. we develop an approach to solve this problem from a very general point of view. we assume that the random field is given by a cumulative distribution. in order to solve the problem, we use the conditional formalism developed by jedamzik ( 1995 ) in which the probability that an arbitrary mass element of a field is part of an isolated region with overdensity @xmath0 is related to the distribution of the halo mass and the specific halo metric function ( mf ). the cumulative distribution has the following properties : * a priori, the distributed halo mf is a decreasing function of the total mass contained in the region, regardless of the assumed redshift step. * in the case when the mass due to the overdensity is a positive constant ( i.e., all halo masses are related to a single mass element ), the cumulative field conditional probability has ( i ) a positive definite ( but non - zero ) value at all radii, and * b ) depends on the resolution, on the mass, and on the sign of the rescaling factor. in contrast to the previous approaches based on the es formalism, this approach allows to calculate the mf and the mrs in a way that is consistent with the simulations, and with the ansatz of the distributions obtained in cosmological n - body simulations. the average halo mah and mrs are found to be a factor of 1.58 or 0.77 more overdense than those measured in simulations, respectively. we show that this factor can be asymptotically enhanced, and may be as large as 10 - 100 times greater than in the simulations. * the properties of the mfs are completely consistent with those derived from the tinker08 halo, even if, for simplicity, the ps ansatz is kept the same. nevertheless, the general property of the conditional mf offers powerful tools to optimize the integration of the merger trees and to build up a catalog of all - region mergers.

the c@xmath0 filled ice is a new form of ice exhibiting anisotropy in the presence of liquid nitrogen, and is a prototype of several adsorbed structures which may be of practical relevance, in particular for the storage and transport of water and hydrogen. we have measured structural and dynamical properties of the sample, and indirectly confirm theoretical predictions, by measuring adsorption isotherms, by using cryogenic raman spectroscopy and dispersive x - ray diffraction. we further verify the theoretical predictions by measuring molecular diffusion inside the structures and in the lattice phonon band, and derive the water - phonon lattice coupling constants in the structure, in the regime of maximum hydrogen depletion. finally, from volumetric hydrogen transport we derive the atomic coordinates of the adsorbing gas and its molar fraction, as a function of pressure, spanning a range from a few millibar at 15 k to several bar at 80 k. * keywords : * nitrogen - based materials, carbon - organic compounds, carbon nanotubes, methane - based ice * institute of physics, chinese academy of sciences, beijing 100190, china + center for emergent matter science, p.o. box 51, piazzale della repubblica 10, 00185 pescara, italy + @xmath1e - mail : gychen@physik.pku.ac.cn, giulia.it _ ( submitted to physics letters b ) _ + journal reference : _ * g. m.ainsley & sons, ` ` condensed matter physics, '' ( urss, nov, # 1, # 2 ), rev. mod. phys. * 82, * ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3#4#1, _ # 2 _, phys. rev. lett. * 89, * # 3 *, 074005 ( latest issue ) @xcite. b. e. williams, w. c. swann, n. r. newbury, j. w. kindler, s. bergamini, d. d. stone, m. aglietta, a. bocquet, c. pitjeva, v. f. fonseca, g. vallisneri, f. cassol - brunner, r. carrion, d.- m. de haas, b. h. de riedmatten,
recent cosmological @xmath0-body simulations of cold dark matter haloes have revealed many empirical relationships concerning self - gravitating systems. however, more and more recent high - resolution simulations suggest that the dark halo density profiles are not strictly universal, such that the associated entropy will diverge to infinity. moreover, one of the recent studies suggests that it is impossible to attaining a so - called quasi - stationary equilibrium state for a system consisting of a large number of particles, even if the system is extremely large and unconfined. in this work, we explore whether the apparent paradoxical behavior of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of self - attracting systems can be solved by introducing some new thoughts, or by revising some fundamental laws or principles of physics, but our results do not conflict with the standard second law of thermodynamics. we first propose a mean - field model to separate gravitational forces into long- and short - range parts, and thus identify three distinct relaxation mechanisms, i.e. violent relaxation, two - body relaxation and gravitational landau damping. by calculating the first - order variation of the entropy, we derive an entropy stationary equation. we find that, if long - range relaxation dominates, the entropy may increase, but in principle it never decreases. on the other hand, short - ranged relaxations are predominant, and although the theory can work for the whole system, the results for the different relaxation mechanisms are in rough agreement with the simulation results in the inner strong - degenerate region and the middle weak - degeneracy region, respectively. according to the behaviour of the solutions, we separate the halo into three different phases, namely : ( 1 ) deep inner regions where the effects of the violent relaxation are manifested as deviations from the power law, such as the saddle point and the saddle - point potentials ; ( 2 ) outer regions, where the gravitational relaxation and the density perturbations take place in the outskirts, like the einasto profile, which is consistent with the finding by previous numerical simulations ; ( 3 ) such a region which is far from the centre of the dark matter halo. we conclude that these three relaxation mechanisms operate at different evolutionary stages and different spatial scales of the system. although the concept of equilibrium entropy may not be anymore valid than the concepts of boltzmann - gibbs entropy and maximum entropy principle, we argue that this does not necessarily mean failure of the theory in its most general form. we also identify the solution of the hydrostatic potential equation as the origin of the
the on - demand sorting of polystyrene particles and cells is a hot topic of scientific research, with applications to cell sorting ranging from cell biology to nanotechnology. current transport methods, such as flow cytometry, require a high throughput, high resolution device, and high resolution imaging, but have limited sensitivity to particle size. here we show that a high - speed microsorter can be constructed with a disposable microfluidic device that is easy to use and produces high quality sorting data in a pocket. the device can be used to detect sub - micron particles with speeds up to @xmath0 particles / s, and has a large measurement bandwidth, due to its single - particle detection capability. we demonstrate this device, both with manual control, and with an integrated push - pull micro - actuator that can be operated at high speed with excellent fidelity. a robust and simple on - chip analysis of the sorting data can then be performed on a much larger number of particles or cells. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 e. knill, r. laflamme, and g. j. milburn, ` ` numerical methods for the analysis of cell sizes and shapes, '' ieee j. sel. top. quant. electron. * 20*(6 ), 50 k@xmath1 ( 2010 ). w. w. parson, c. denninghoff, a. kuhlmey, s. steinlechner, m. bjarklev, p. bienstman, k. bernet, and p.o. hulst, _ surface transport in cell biology _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 2011 ). v. giovanni, g. baili, f. bretenaker, l. bergamini, d. bertolucci, j. rosseland, j.- p. ram, porter for single - molecule sorting, " appl. phys. lett. * 76*(24 ), 471374 ( 2008 ). m. knittel, x. yamamoto, t. maihara, xie, and d. d. li, electronic resolution of a spherical nanoparticle analyzer, " nat. materials * 7*(4 ), 871875 ( 2009 ). b. brian stephenson, c.- m. j. padgett,
the first order of the first order with respect to @xmath0 michelson interferometer for measuring the velocity of aether wind was demonstrated experimentally at the naval research laboratory of belfast, n. ireland on june 22 june 1 - 5, 2009 july 15, by operating at 2.5 mm of diameter on a kinescope consisting of two glass tubes filled with varying dielectric permittivities of two different media. first order foils the fringe shift of interference fringe shift caused by the interaction of light with a semi - transparent moving medium into the medium of the second order. as first order effects the interference fringe shifts as a function of difference between difference s. the method of measurement was switched on and off. at the last moment i briefly report experimental results of the experiment. _ introduction. _ the first and second order of interferometers became available almost 40 years ago @xcite on friday, april 15th, 1976. they are based on the cross - like interferometry of a rotating cross - section of a half - transparent plate. the wavelength of light running in one medium and then returning back through the other is chosen to be of the same order or higher than the propagation wavelength. such interferometric devices become available at microwaves and have become a useful tool for a variety of astrophysical measurements. they were among the first ones to be used for a precise measurement of heliocentric distances between stars, as well as for the determination of solar distances in the solar atmosphere. they could be widely used for astronomical observations, geoelectric devices for geodesy, helioseismic devices for the astrometric measurements, and for the investigations in the physics of planetary nebulae and stars, respectively. they provide a reliable way not only to detect the earth moving relative to the sun, but also for the study of celestial objects such as the sun and the moon, to name but a few astrophysical phenomena. they play a crucial role in our understanding of various phenomena occurring in space and time. a few observational evidences of their existence in nature are to be found in literature. in particular, the first reports of a first order effect of some particles diffusion phenomena in the universe are very rare. _ program summary. _ _ it was the historically first method that took into account the parameters of the medium that was used as light s carrier. the present theory of second order effects in the propagation of light s carriers was described in the papers
we present an analysis of three helium - rich subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars in the galactic field, pg1544 + 488, jl87 and lb1766, obtained ultraviolet spectra with the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ). all three stars have an atmosphere rich in helium, as expected from their membership in the hot horizontal branch ( hb ) sequence, and all show supersolar nitrogen abundances. a line - blanketed model atmosphere composed of helium _ and _ carbon _ is used to derive the main stellar parameters : effective temperature, surface gravity, helium - to - hydrogen abundance ratio, and carbon abundance. new evolutionary calculations using our model atmosphere program, tlusty, version 200, show that flash mixing can produce stars with enhanced helium and carbon in their envelope. a similar process has been proposed to produce the extremely hydrogen - poor r coronae borealis stars ( also known as ` ` born - again '' stars ), whereby the surface hydrogen is mixed inward during a helium-_shell _ flash on the white - dwarf cooling curve. we find that the surface abundances of these three sdb stars are all consistent with those derived from previous studies, which strongly support the flash - mixing scenario for the formation of these stars. however, we find a number of anomalies among the hot hb population in the globular cluster ngc 2808, including an unexplained gap within the ehb and the existence of subluminous ehb stars. we discuss these anomalies in light of the numerical model atmosphere and show that they might be the result of a population of helium - deficient stars that lie well below the canonical ehb. we also present an explanation for the discrepancies between the predicted and observed hb distributions in the ultraviolet color - magnitude diagrams of ngc2808. flash mixing produces hb stars that are hotter by about 5000 to 6000k, and have surface gravities that are significantly lower than predicted for canonical, shallow and deep mixing models.
we study community detection in quantum networks. the task of community detection is the partitioning of a set of nodes into non - overlapping and non - empty subsets, called communities. community detection methods based on transport and fidelity recover the main features of the quantum community structure obtained by classical methods, but can not capture quantum effects. we therefore develop a novel quantum community detection approach, which is based on the projection of a quantum state onto a community subspace, and which captures the full quantum dynamics within each subspace. some intuitive features of classical community detection do not necessarily transfer over to quantum systems. we illustrate our approach by applying it to three different quantum networks : the lhcii light harvesting complex, the quantum mechanical analog of a communication network, and an artificial quantum network. we find that despite the quantum treatment of phase, these quantum networks exhibit a distinct community structure different from what might be expected from classical methods. our results open the question of which level of the hierarchy yields the optimal community partitioning, and how to optimally utilize quantum effects in community detection. quantum information technology has witnessed rapid development in the last twenty years @xcite, and quantum algorithms and simulation methods suitable for real - world systems are now a mature technology. for example, self - organized quantum walks ( e.g. guided walks ) can now be performed on complex quantum networks and are finding applications in many fields of science. the quantum walker, represented as a weighted probability distribution, occupies the single node state @xmath0 and is allowed to ` hop'along subspaces in the network, known as communities, to locate other nodes ( nodes are connected to other nodes by inter - community links ). this is one of the salient features of quantum walks, which nevertheless appear to be surprisingly difficult to detect. given the complexity of the problem, it is of paramount importance to understand the fundamental principles guiding the design and implementation of quantum methods, and to understand which, if any, of these principles are optimal for a given system. quantum walks can be classified as either non - interacting ( atomic, molecular, optical, or quantum ) or interacting ( classical ) degrees of freedom. there are several types of walks in the literature, which are often related to the problem of quantum mechanical effects in the systems they are detecting. interactions between the nodes in a quantum network lead to the emergence of quantum communities whose structure and properties are thus strongly dependent on the quantum state of the system. while it may be easy to investigate communities in classical networks, this is not the case
we study the evolution of a planar tree graph from the origin to a circle. as the radius of the tree increases, the pattern of white edges and black edges at different levels on the tree evolves to a coarse version of the original contour. the evolution is captured by the position of the endpoints of the contour along characteristics, which are connected components of the origin. these endpoints are either stationary, ` ` rising faces '', or interpolating. the latter type of endpoints includes rising faces and arcs, and it is through this prism that we learn about the multivaluedness of the evolution along characteristics. we construct a combinatorial model of this evolution that focuses on the simplest case of a rectangle with four endpoints : rising faces, arcs, rising arcs and falling faces. for this example, we solve the inviscid burgers equation without the step function factor, and the result is a tight upper bound to the absolute growth rate with a constant radius @xmath0. in a later paper, we will generalize this solution to the case where the equation is solved with a step function. in the meanwhile, there are plenty of other interesting examples in which the situation is more complicated, e.g. when the original shape is replaced by a hyperbolic one, or when an arbitrarily large number of faces or arcs form a single object in a crowded and noisy environment. the complexity arises from the fact that we as well as the solution itself can be viewed as a physical phenomenon. for example, regular polygons have only one level. when moving along a contour, this means we just need to measure the angular width of the base of the largest hump to determine the speed of the growth. there are several different ways of embedding this in the regular graph, and in particular, the authors of this paper have developed a framework in which to extract the trajectories of the different endpoints. this work is inspired by the work of melikyan @xcite, the author s research is partially supported by an nsf grant, and he is grateful to the hospitality of the university of michigan for its hospitality.
we present new gemini mid - infrared images, high - resolution optical spectra, and _ chandra _ high x - resolution grating spectra of the star doar 21, which is a pre main - sequence star with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 and a hard thermal spectrum. we also present an analysis of several archival _ spitzer _ observations, and use them both to improve our knowledge of the stellar activity and circumstellar environment of this young, magnetically active star. the new images and spectra show that the star s circumstellar material is extended in a direction approximately perpendicular to the stellar disk, and that the emission from its hot plasma is extended out to several hundred au ( i.e. several orders of magnitude beyond the circumstellar radius ), where we find an unevolved pah cloud. the infrared images reveal that the disk is surrounded by weak but very broad emission wings, suggesting that the x - rays are produced by disk accretion, as in the case of older, coronally - active low - mass stars. the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation field is significantly stronger than that seen in most of the t tauri stars observed previously, with a peak intensity and spectral shape consistent with optically thin disk gas. the results from all of these previous studies suggest that the fuv radiation field has a significant effect on the hot plasma on young stars, with the most likely explanation being that it is the high - energy radiation from the disks in which is heating the hot gas and therefore exerts a hard uv flux. in particular attention is paid to the effect of pah emission, which has been seen in a few other young stars and is likely the source of the bulk of the pah ionization in the uv - excited pah - emitting zone of circumstellar disks. as a corollary to this study, we have derived the densities, temperatures, and abundances for the hot circumbinary disk gas in doar-21. we find that the available density diagnostics place the star in well - defined agn phase, consistent with the lack of strong accretion signatures.
we analyze protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) networks and find that the best - fitting network model that exhibits a geometric structure is the one that has the best fit to the data. we parameterize the network fingerprint by a 34-dimensional vector that coordinates the properties of the nodes in a network : the average degree, clustering coefficient, average diameter, degree distribution, and frequencies of the appearance of all 31 1 - 5-node graphlets. we use five different probabilistic methods to predict the best fitting ppi network model for a variety of random networks of different sizes. we consider three random network models : erds - rnyi random graphs, scale - free barabsi - albert networks, and geometric random graphs. when we evaluate the fit of the data to the models, we find inconclusive results, as each of the properties favors a different model. we propose a new method that finds a best - fit network model based on a collection of different properties of a given network and integrates the data in a manner that imposes constraints on the number of degrees and number of edges over the network. it is based on the idea of the _ network fingerprint _ and the _ average degree _ of a node. the data can be represented as a series of points in a metric space, nodes of which edges are associated with 1,600,100,000 different positions in the metric space according to some distance norm. we normalize the data so that we use, to a great extent, what is the relation between the degree distribution and the clustering spectrum to characterize the structure of a real - world network, and to assign confidence levels to new protein interaction discoveries. we find that low - confidence dt and svm random graphs are the least robust among the five methods we use to fit the data, while geo is the best with respect to all other properties. thus, we conclude that a well - fitting complex network model would provide insights into understanding of complex biological phenomena, such as protein function, disease and evolution, if the data are correctly interpreted and interpreted.
we develop a general approach to deal with the non - linear transport of a quantum dot through a reservoir at zero temperature using a real - time renormalization group approach that naturally connects to the generalized quantum master / kinetic equation approach. for this purpose, we study the simplest possible benchmark model of an interacting quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to metallic electrodes, the anderson model. we formulate the perturbation series for the effective liouvillian @xmath0 using what we will call _ causal representation of field _ superoperators _ and develop a corresponding formalism for the corresponding rg equation. this allows for a detailed study of the zero - temperature transport using the leading frequency dependence and fully renormalized two - loop terms. with some minor modifications, the approach is suitable for the kondo regime, for which the linear current appears naturally as an exact result already in the one - loop rt - rg formulation. in the second part of the paper, we show how the approach can be extended to the reservoirs with continuous field and voltage, and develop it further for the weak - coupling regime. we explicitly set up a statistical analysis of the nonlinear transport, including the effect of high - order tunneling processes and present evidence that this approach may help break the degeneracy between weak- and strong - coupling limits. when applied to the single - electron tunneling ( set ) stability diagram, we find that the strong coupling has a linear current even at zero bias, a fact that leads to a significant _ inelastic _ enhancement of the resonant cotunneling resonance. we show that the same approach is also required to calculate the energy dependence of the energy squared differences between the dots and electrodes, and establish a connection between the two types of resonances. the importance of for the present model ( and, below also, for the future development of the theory ) is demonstrated numerically. a key result of this paper is the derivation of 30 coupled differential coupling functions that systematically incorporate the frequency - dependent coupling functions.
we present a study of the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal due to large scale structure in two fields studied as part of the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ). the data were obtained using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at la palma. the large area covered by the data allows us to study the dark matter properties of the galaxies targeted by the survey, and to this end we make extensive use of the redshifts and multi - colour photometry available for 1125 galaxies in the two fields. we examine the amount of cosmic shear that can produce a signal as a function of galaxy properties, and find that for our two fields the signal is too low to be detected by a direct measurement of the signal caused by an individual galaxy. we measure the average tangential distortion parameter @xmath0 km / s around 3 subsamples of lenses, and use this result together with the semi - analytic method developed earlier by hoekstra et al. to study how the signal depends on clustering model parameters ( lensing truncation, lensing width, and velocity dispersion ), we use a model in which the mass - to - light ratio of dark matter halos ranges from 0.2 to 5, with a median value of 0.6. we apply the model to the redshift distribution of galaxies in each field, and study the scatter around the lenses. we find that the 95 % confidence level ( c.l. ) upper limit on the average dark matter density at 95 % cl is 0.5@xmath10.3. we study the effects of various clustering models and model - independent uncertainties in the lensing measurement, and examine the sensitivity of the results to the assumption that all galaxies are clustered. we use the best - fit models in the framework of exponential clustering, to derive the upper limits on the likelihood of a galaxy to lie in a particular dark matter halo. we conclude that halo clustering can not be ruled out in this study.

we present a model where a quantum refrigerator is constructed out of three qubits. the first two qubits are the refrigerator and the third qubit is the object to be cooled. the model consists of three particles, where one is the source of heat and the other two are used to heat the environment. the interaction between particles is only two - body nearest neighbour interactions. we demonstrate that our system works as a refrigerator when exposed to heat flowing into the environment from the hot bath and the second object is in contact with a colder bath. we show that the system can even cool other objects and that if the bath temperature is of order @xmath0 k, then the refrigerator is cooled to the absolute zero of temperature. we suggest that the ability to cool to this extremely low temperature is limited by two fundamental limitations of modern technology ; the imperfect insulation of the external environment, and the finite time scales required to implement the correct timing timing. quantum information technology has made possible remarkable advances in the last decade, with methods that allow for manipulations of many - body systems. to date a single quantum device has been found that can perform tasks such as switching between excitation states of a quantum system and a classical object, or separating and freezing samples of different types of objects. one such system is the quantum refrigerator @xcite based on the fact that thermalisation can be removed from the system by external work. an important feature of these systems is their ability to refrigerate other objects, as these objects are their interaction potentials can be switched between different states without external refrigeration. an example of this ability is a microwave refrigerator@xcite, which was recently found to work correctly at room temperature. another advantage of using a microwave environment is that it removes the need for external work to cool objects, is that by pumping heat into the microwave environment it removes any thermal dependence of the system s temperature. a natural question to ask is whether or not there are fundamental limitations on the temperature to which the ability of the aforementioned model can still be used. the answer depends on the thermalisation rate and the amount of external work that is performed on the system. for perfect thermalisation it is possible, however, for two reasons. first, in the limit of perfect insulation the performance is expected to be poorer than that of a ferromagnetic refrigerator. secondly, if the environment is not supplied with heat but the system is exposed to a hot bath, then it will cease to cool, as this will decrease the efficiency of the refrigerator. in this regime the
the competing exchange interactions between the nn and nnn spins in @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 create a magnetic spiral in the zigzag spin - chain phase diagram. this spiral magnetic order, existing below 3.1(1)k, can be described with a single nn magnetic wave vector * k*=(0 0 0.423 ), is a manifestation of the frustration in the interchain exchange interactions leading to sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. here we reveal the effects of the external magnetic field and temperature on the magnetic structure factor, characterizing both the chiral and non - chiral exchange parameters of this frustrated system. we report a ferromagnetic character of the magnetic susceptibility, obtained from a detailed study of the temperature and magnetic - field - dependent neutron diffraction. we determine the magnetic phase diagram and determine the atomic positions, thereby providing additional insight into the nature of the dominant exchange interactions in this resonantly interacting system. the success of the nnn bridge and oxyhalide tellurites makes it an excellent test bed for the study of quantum spin - exchange dynamics. in particular, we demonstrate that the quantum phase transition from nn to nnn spin-1/2 bridges is suppressed below 2(1 )k, with a noticeable increase in the applied magnetic field. this magnetic transition is observed to be accompanied by a loss of collective chirality, in good agreement with the predictions of the well - known quantum - mechanical spin - tellurite quantum fluctuations. despite the high potential of this material for driving the system towards magnetism, it remains one of the most challenging problems of modern condensed matter physics, representing a candidate for the building blocks of a spintronic device. the enduring challenge of finding good magnetic order in a variety of systems is embodied by the ever - present problem of magnetic frustration. examples of such frustration can be found in diluted magnetic semiconductors, often presenting quantum fluctuations of the order of magnitude below 1 % @xcite, described by the competing exchange parameters ( see methods ). in this case, the incommensurability of the spiral magnetic ground state is the result of the combination of the jacquet - kohmoto - nagali - wohlert ( jk ) length - scales and the nel - pomeranchuk - yafet ( nnn ) exchange interaction, which in principle can be resolved by the use of an external control parameter, e.g., the magnetic polarization. in the case of
the development of new experimental techniques to manipulate and address non - collinear quantum systems with nanoscale dimensions has led to exciting possibilities for the realization of large - scale quantum simulators. controllable ferromagnetic vortices in semiconductor heterostructures have revolutionized our understanding of condensed matter physics, being able to confine themselves to a few nanometers in diameter, while achieving macroscopic addressability and self - organization at the same time. the nv / vortex system has emerged as an ideal setting in which to study non - classical spin dynamics, and is an ideal test bed to understand the emergence of quantum coherence and non - local order in ferromagnetically ordered systems. we demonstrate here an increase in the ability to address a single nv in the @xmath0 mhz field of a fm microdisk using coherent optical manipulation of nv spins in a two - dimensional magnetic field. optical vortex - interferometry with a gold coplanar waveguide enables the direct addressability of multiple nvs in a single nanometer. this allows the first realization of a scalable quantum simulator for many - body systems, while also providing a route to several - dimensional ` ` bloch spheres '', in which the spins of several nvs are localized in two dimensions. the concept of a bloch sphere has first been realized in 1959 by erwin schrdinger, who revealed the peculiar magnetic heisenberg uncertainty relation@xcite. the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) relation can be mapped to a local epr interaction hamiltonian by overcoating the inner region of a nematic disk with a magnetically conducting material, giving rise to a broadband spin - density - wave ( dosimir effect ). this magnetically - induced field - induced magnetization transition was later explained by lynden - bell, who observed that the field strength near the vortex core is larger than that at the outer region, suggesting the vortex is contributing to the magnetic field seen by the observer. the motion of the vortex can be directly addressed using the technique of stimulated rabi oscillation, although the application of a coherent optical field may require the use of a high - intensity magnetic field in order to achieve sufficiently high frequency switching. more recently, advances in microfabrication techniques have enabled the realisation of arrays of magnetic dots that can be physically grown using single - dimensional electron optics, including scanning tunneling microscopy, x - ray and nuclear magnetic microscopy.
the recent discovery of the first collisional family of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) around haumea ( also known as @xmath0 ) motivates us to consider the formation of the haumeua family possibly during a giant impact. we propose a formation scenario for the family members that is consistent with recent results from simulations of giant impacts. in our model, the giant impact creates a single moon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision with an unbound kbo. afterward, the satellite ejects itself via a tidal - evolution procedure. the destructive satellite - ejection process has a collision timescale of several tens of gyrs and does not require the simultaneous creation of multiple satellites and direct ejection of fragments in a single collision. we find that this formation scenario yields about one collisionally formed family for objects in the kui per belt. the satellite that is created as a result of the collision is extremely highly eccentric and has a semi - major axis of 49500 km and an eccentricity of 0.07. it has a mass surface density, mass albedo, and position angle that is in good agreement with current determinations for kbos. the timescale for the satellite - break - up is estimated to be between 100 and 200 gyrs. we also find that due to the long tidal evolution timescale, a single satellite can not be ejected from haumeawa without causing a significant loss of velocity dispersion among its family members. this result implies that the dynamical coherence of the family is maintained until the end of its dynamical excitation in which case it is dynamically excited. our formation scenario provides a plausible explanation for the origin of the observed high velocity families around kbos and the lack of evidence for satellite formation in the recent past. this model also suggests that the polar accretion disk was a factor 3 more massive than it is today.

the effect of temperature on the decoherence rate @xmath0 measured in disordered metal wires is an important test for our theory of quantum chromodynamics. it was found in refs. @xcite that the maximum dephasing times for some metals are several orders of magnitude larger than for others. in this paper we compare these observations with our theoretical predictions based on a linear scaling of the growth of the dephased times and their dependence on the material parameters. in particular, we find that the temperature - independent slope of the linear dependence of the effective decoherences is in agreement with our theory and is expected to be universal for all metals. we also confirm this result applying to disordered silver samples. another indication of the universality of the low temperature behavior of free path propagation of quantum entanglement, namely, its saturation at low temperatures, was observed for several samples with nearly the same resistivity as for the pure gold sample. in that case the effect of the temperature also appears to be more pronounced than that predicted within our theory. the recent past has witnessed an important development of the study of the effects of temperature - dependent quantum effects on the dynamics of many - body systems. to cite one example, within the field of disordered conductors, a significant amount of work has been devoted to the cause of unusual behavior of the dominant quantum noise, i.e., the saturation ( or anomalous redshift ) of the free path ( or quasi - saturation ) of quantum pseudo - random walkers. several different theories have been developed to explain this phenomenon, using various degrees of freedom of the system. one of them is that quantum effects are stronger than classical ones solely due to a lower critical temperature. within this theory it is necessary to invoke quantum corrections to the system in order to generate the higher temperature behavior. a third possibility is that the anomalous low temperatures of quantum noise are caused by _ non - uniform _ conductivity in the wires. a theory consistent with these possibilities was recently presented by altman _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. b * 80 *, 041302 ( 2009 ) ]. their experimental observations were based on ten samples ( 6 quasi-@xmath1 and 8 samples with similar resistivities, widths and temperatures ) fabricated from the same material with practically the same conductivity. in spite of these similarities between the material and its properties ( high concentration of magnetic impurities, large magnetic field, uniform conductivity ) the experimental data suggest that the saturation of
we present a general theory that relates the stacking sequences of a binary colloidal mixture in the presence of gravity to its bulk phase diagram. in this way we can group all possible stacking sequences in a stacking diagram that follows directly from the bulk phase diagrams. the stacking and bulk phases are linked by a well defined mathematical mapping based on the legendre transform. we show that the gibbs phase rule does not apply to the maximum number of layers in sedimentation equilibrium, nor to the transition number of phases that occur in the pure components of the mixture. hence finite - size and surface effects modify and enrich this scenario via wetting at the upper and lower boundaries and capillary evaporation of very thin floating layers. we apply the theory to a mixture of infinitely thin circular hard platelets and find that for these simple mixtures stacking sequences can occur with a very high number of bins in the stacking diagram. as a consequence, extremely rich phase transitions can occur, which can be captured by a two - binodal approach. we identify six different stacking sequences, each associated with a different sedimentation state, that lead to a unique collection of asymptotic conclusions. the theory applies to binary mixtures with either single or double degeneracy, and in particular to binary hard core and nematic mixtures. we predict that stacking sequences with multiple degeneracy occur in very rich systems. sedimentation is a fundamental fluid phenomenon, which originates in the natural complexity of biological processes @xcite. over the past several decades sedimentation has been observed in a wide variety of systems. a variety of different aspects of sedimentation have been studied in liquids, vesicles, colloidal mixtures, and granular mixtures for which the equilibrium state is a turbulent mixture of a number of liquid helium and carbon atoms. the original interest in the sedimentation behaviour in these systems stemmed from the belief that it could be a mechanism to transition from the pure, geometrically smooth fluid to the composite, via sedimentation. recently, however, sedimentation studies in dilute organic solutions have taken centre stage as a powerful tool to probe the structure of phase transitions in mixtures and to investigate the interplay between morphology and hydrodynamics. for example, the geometry of the lids of container mixtures can be studied by studying the evolution of their sedimentation states with height difference in height ; in this direction, it has been especially useful to study the coexistence and coexistence of different phases in confined systems, cf. ( e.g.
we present our results from co(1 - 0 ) observations of the nearby ` ` antennae '' galaxy arp 244 using the vla ( ` ` very large array '' ) and the nrao 12 m co maps. although most of the molecular emission is confined to a small region in the overlap region, we reveal that strong starbursts continue to occur _ before _ the onset of the ultraluminous starburst phase. the radio - to - co ratio map ( @xmath0 ) allows us to accurately determine the local star formation efficiency ( sfe ) across the disk. this is a good match to the co and radio continuum images as well as to the far - infrared chandra x - ray images. the highest sfe sites are found in the small overlap region ; we find that the sfe level in this region is similar to that of the milky way disk gmcs. therefore, we conclude that the starburst is probably not located in the high concentration star clusters, but rather in much larger regions in the disk overlap. we discuss our results in light of the implications of a possible molecular gas overlap prior to the merger of the gas disks into a merged merged system ( termed ` ` toomre - nordstrom '' hereafter ). we compare our observations to a full - synthesis berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) map and a map of the nuclei of the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) association ( from the literature ). the bima map has about the same spatial resolution as the co maps, but has a substantially larger velocity spread. it also yields a lower molecular gas mass than the previously accepted. both the radio continuum and the co ( nearly equal - intensity ) maps indicate that there is little to no depletion of molecular gas onto the disk, and that the molecular gas is distributed in a kpc - scale exponential distribution. the very high sfe map ( fwhm@xmath1 ) therefore does not reveal the location of the highest concentrations of dense molecular gas, although we suggest that the dense cores are located near the major co concentrations.
we introduce a new definition of translation surface, which is a compact orientable surface of opposite sides that is connected to a translation atlas by special atlases. translation surfaces satisfy two dichotomies : topological dichotomy and strict ergodicity. we show that the best description of a translation surface is given by the riemann - hurwitz formula, which describes the relation between the euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a ramified covering of the other. we describe the mechanism by which two surfaces with different angles in a given direction become reflections of the original polygon when they are ramified. we give a detailed description of the mechanism using examples. the study of billiards is a blooming field of study in modern mathematics. a billiard trajectory is defined as a trajectory that does not hit singular points on its initial trajectory. given a trajectory starting at a side of a polygon, the billiard can be continued along the original direction, passing copies of the polygon along the side and merging it with the new side. if the new trajectory continues along the direction it was started in, it is called an _ unfolding process_. given two paths that intersect at different points in the same direction, the outcome is the formation of a new billiard. in this paper we describe this process and give an example of how it can be understood in terms of topological properties of translation surfaces. + let @xmath0 be a simple closed oriented polygon. if one of the two _ angles _ in euclidean polygons is odd, and the other is even, then there is an atlas of its singular points by a translation. we say that a _ translation surface _ is a _ flat structure _ if the three are connected by a single object with an even angle between them. + an _ affine diffeomorphism _ of such a fixed polygon is a translation in the opposite direction. we call a _ lattice surface _ if for every direction the transition function from a singular point to the singular point is uniquely ergodic. there are two equivalent definitions of lattice surfaces : the _ cactus _ and the _ euler _ types. the first type is more general and more specific : translation surfaces are closed surfaces, cactus covers are the surfaces that are copies of flat structures associated with specific flat structures. the second type is the _ tracer _ type : a tracer has the same property, that is, the tracer is a covering of a surface by
we discuss general aspects of confinement - deconfinement transitions in the qcd vacuum. in which quarks are released from nucleons and play an important role. we derive a set of self - consistent equations for the case of the one - pair problem with gluon propagators in one and two spatial dimensions. the schwinger - dyson equation and the bethe - salpeter equation in one dimension describe the confinement of quarks deep inside of the fermi sea. in the two - dimensional case, we reduce the 3 + 1-dimensional equations to 1 + 1 dimensional ones. the numerical results are compared to theoretical calculations. we point out that the chiral symmetry is partly restored by the presence of pairing interactions. the phase transition from the nuclear matter to the quark matter has a large energy scale due to the finite size of this region. as the energy scale increases, chiral pairs of particles with opposite momenta are widely spread in space, resulting in nonuniform condensates in which the conventional particle - antiparticle type chiral condensate disappears. the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the high baryon density and low temperature has attracted continuous interests. the standard model starts with the breaking of the @xmath0 expansion. since the vacuum is dominated by qcd phenomena, a lot of attention has been devoted to the low temperature end of the phase diagram. these phenomenological models have been studied by many authors @xcite. however, in spite of their success, deep in the finite - density qcd is not a fountain of hadronic excitations. for example the vacuum qcd has several problems that require a solution to one or more of these problems. one of them is the problem of low temperature nonlinear condensation of hadrons into quarks without using energy. because hadrons do not interact directly with each other, and because strong nuclear forces are strong, it is natural to think of the hadronic - nuclear phase transition as a product of several short - range interactions. this is what we address in the present paper. the medium - scale hadron interactions are repulsive. the long - range repulsive interactions between quarks play an essential role in this scenario ( relevant for hadron - nuclear transitions ). the short - distance repulsion can be viewed as an effective force acting on quarks in a similar way as in the far - from - equilibrium phase diagram ( cf. ( 1.1 ) ). it is the case that, as
we present h i spectral line observations obtained with the very large array ( vla ) for five sources that were selected from the alfalfa ` ` almost dark '' population. these are systems whose h i properties are representative of normal dwarf galaxies, but that lack a clear optical counterpart. one system in our sample ( agc193953 ) is a merging system of four h i - emitting galaxies. the separation of the two systems that were previously detected with vla is @xmath075 kpc, placing this system in the category of ` ` very dark '' systems. agc208399 and agc226178, previously identified as possible optical counterparts, show evidence of coherent rotation in their h i images, but whether these are truly ` ` dark '' galaxies remains debatable. in agc223638, a nuclear point source is coincident with the optical counterpart of agc233638 ; an sdss spectrum of this bright central knot indicates that an optical counterpart is nearby. the h i results combined with uv and optical imaging from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the galex satellite are used to determine the mass to light ratio ( m@xmath3/l ) of each of the sources. while none of the systems is luminous enough to be ruled out as a true dark galaxy, we do confirm the presence of massive, compact h i systems in four of the five systems. a tidal origin is strongly suggested for these sources, and we speculate that at least two of them may be dwarf galaxies that have been stripped down to their present - day masses. one h i system, agc229166, is located close to a star - forming group in a nearby galaxy ( ngc3370 ). however, its h i morphology is unlike that of known very dark dwarf galaxies and is unusual among gas - rich systems. we conclude that the very dark h i gas may not be tidal, but rather are systems with multiple h i neighbors that are part of a small group or a single h i cloud. the distribution and kinematics of the objects suggest that some of these systems may be truly dark galaxies.
we present optical spectroscopy of @xmath0 radio galaxies obtained with ccd slit spectrographs on the 3.6 m and 4.1 m telescopes at the european southern observatory and at the very large telescope ( wht ) of the muchachos observatory ( elts ) in la palma. the sample consists of 64 radio galaxies with redshifts between 1.7 and 3.0. we find that 30 % of these radio galaxies have spectral indices steeper than 1.9, compared to only 3 % of the previously published uss samples. the steepening of the radio spectrum at higher frequencies is most likely due to increased cosmic ray ionization, although a contribution from increased compton losses can not be ruled out. the ly@xmath1 function and the equivalent width of the lyman series emission lines are strongly correlated, with a median redshift of 2.2. we interpret this correlation as being due to the fact that the higher ionization lines are systematically blueshifted with respect to the lower ionization line by up to 3000 km s@xday. this is in contrast to quasars, where the shifts are observed only on a much smaller scale. we consider two possible explanations for the occurrence of the velocity shifts. first, the outflow of highly ionized gas from the active nucleus in combination with obscuration of the far side of the galaxy, possibly by hot stars, can produce the observed velocity shifts between the emission lines. on the other hand, a significant fraction ( 60 % ) of hzrg show the presence of associated hi absorption in their spectra, producing velocity shifts of greater than 100 km sonday. we propose that when the peak of the hi absorption system is located at the location of the highest ionization emission line, the associated absorption system shifts the hydrogen atoms from the foreground. this mechanism could explain the large redshift velocity shifts observed in hzrgs. in addition, if the average density of radio galaxies at high redshift is similar to that at lower redshift, there should be no significant evidence for a decrease in the radio density at the lowest redshift. finally, we briefly discuss the radio luminosity function of uss radio galaxies. at the median spectral index of the sample which includes 29 sources with spectral index larger than 2.3, the ratio of the rest frame rest frame optical luminosity to the baryonic luminosity is constant, showing no evidence of a minimum luminosity at a given redshift
we construct explicit examples of @xmath0 proper sets of tree orders using the breadth - first search order and the tree - numbering ordering provided by the sandpile model. the following problem arises in the study of the appearance of edges in directed graphs. given a directed graph on vertices, suppose that there is a unique order on the set of edges going from the root of the graph to the vertices for all vertices in the set for which the graph is complete at the end. it is of this nature that the search order for the number of edges coming out of the root is invented. one of the first questions to be answered in this context is the following : what is the least number of vertices that must be in every undirected graph? is there an invariant higher than unity? it has been known for a long time that answer answers are yes and there is an assumption that this is true. however, it is not completely clear what is true, and what the limit means. in this paper we propose an exact answer, and we show examples of examples where the answer is indeed correct. the idea to search for directions on graphs has been around for more than twenty years. see @xcite and references therein. the process of search also has been studied in various seemingly unrelated contexts. for example, the search of leaves in a graph is probably not the best way to find potential paths to an edge, especially when the edges are long. the purpose of this paper is to provide an explicit example of some examples. we begin by explaining the problem of search orders which are needed for the sake of completeness, but also just plain curiosity. we then describe the construction of the necessary orders that will lead to the precise approach of constructing explicit examples.
the sub - wavelength imaging with flat isofrequency components based on thin wire media has recently been extended to microwave frequencies using the finite - difference time domain ( fdtd ) method. although the proposed method is for the first time applied for the modeling of spatially dispersive materials, it is suitable for the imaging of structures which include components formed by materials with complex electromagnetic properties : the wire medium, bi - anisotropic media, non - linear materials, left - handed media and photonic crystals. one example of such materials is the uniaxial drude material. the spatial dispersion effects in this material are taken into account in the modeling using an auxiliary differential equation method which is formulated as a permittivity tensor. in contrast to the previous analytical models which only consider the frequency dispersive effects, we present analytical expressions which account for the spatial as well as the frequency dependent dispersion. we demonstrate the significant role of taking into account these effects in the modeled wire medium by modeling a planar slab of three - dimensional wire media, the lattices of which are parallel and ideally conducting, in the @xmath0-dimensional space. we consider two types of the modes which correspond to the transmission lines, the transverse magnetic field with respect to the wires and the extraordinary ( as opposed to the ordinary modes ) modes which are special kinds of waves when the wavelength in the free space is comparable with the period of the structure. in the thin wire approximation one can regard these as the modes of a sub - millimeter transmission line which does not interact with the wires, but with zero electric field along the wires. these modes are capable of transporting light across the interface of the lattice in different directions from one interface to another. we also introduce a new mode, the transmission line mode ( transmission - line ), which can be used to transmit transverse electric field with zero bias in the wires to another interface. numerical simulations of the modeled planar slabs show that as the wavelength decreases and the mode - to - mode switching occurs over a wide range of frequencies. 99 j. a. pendry, ` ` journal of biomedical optics, '' j. submillimeterwave technol. * 14 *, 033406 ( 2011 ). w. wang, l. peng, q. li, xie, r. zhang, x. jiang, f. torquato, x.- c. guo, and f. n. k. lee, solid state sub
the axial uniformity of coronal loops is the result of a combination of a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equation of motion and an axially non - uniform, axisymmetric magnetic flux tube. when the flux tube is initially current - free, the axial bulge and/or twisted component of the magnetic force flow along the loop axis together with the associated transient toroidal plasma velocity. the force is proportional to the square of the distance of the footpoints along the axis. this straight geometry representation has been used in many previous studies of flux tube equilibrium conditions. however, the analysis presented here differs substantively from these previous studies because our analysis does not begin by assuming existence of an equilibrium. instead, we identify the dynamics that lead to an equilibrium and show how the resulting equilibrium is intimately related to these dynamics. furthermore, we take into account the non - force - free aspects of the equilibrium. 5 mm = -0.5 mm cite#1#2[#1]@tempswa tempcntc citex[# 1]#1126 citeotempcnta#tempcntb@neciteaciteforciteb:=#2citeofrefs#1acitea#1 biblabel##1##1 # 1#2 a&a, climate change, helioseismology, solar physics, magnetic fields, coronal loop geometry, x - ray astronomy, methods : numerical, experimental, theoretical
we simulate the distribution of soft x - ray emission from the halo and disk of several nearby starburst galaxies, based on a theoretical model of the million degrees phase of the interstellar medium in the bulge, disk and halo of spiral galaxies. we apply the bipolar hypershell ( bhs ) model developed for the milky way halo to the galactic disk, which describes well the spatial distribution of hot gas in the vicinity of a central starburst. we assume that a recent starburst in the central region of the galaxy causes a sudden energy release in the galactic center, which is interpreted as a shock front originating from the starburst 15 million years ago, with a total energy release of the order of @xmath0 ergs. the shock front is shock heated by the ambient ism, and its spectrum can be well described by a two - dimensional hyper - shell model. we adopt the same numerical methods that was originally used to model the north polar spur nps and associated spurs in the disk of ngc 253 in the literature, and use the shock envelope tracing method of sakashita ( 1971 ) and mllenhoff ( 1976 ). for the simulations presented in the present paper, the inner and outer halo emission can be separated into two main components : ` ` coronal '' emission arising from hot interstellar medium close to the disk, and ` ` ` outer '' emission with an extent of up to 250 kpc along the se minor axis. the coronal emission can most probably be detected from the near ( se side of ) the galaxy, while it is likely to be partly shielded by the hi disk due to the intergalactic medium from the nucleus to the nw. the x - rays in the latter component are produced by hot gas located in a superposition of various discrete sources including : supernovae, sn - remnants and hii regions. we also calculate a case in which the total halo halo density decreases with a power law. the result of our simulations nicely reproduces the observed radio spurs and corresponding line profiles, as well as the radio - brightened counter - spurs, and the radio continuum halo features. the simulation suggests that the time scale of the interaction between a galactic super - wind driven by the central nucleus and the dense interstellar matter in spiral galaxies is of order of a few tens of million years. we propose to use the simulation results to indirectly date and measure the explosive events at the nuclei, and to directly measure the energy released at the
we reanalyze the lmc disk kinematics using archived carbon - star radial - velocity data. we present a prediction for the self - lensing optical depth versus disk scale height, assuming a constant - thickness, exponential disk model with no dark halo. we contrast this model with a recent analysis by kunkel, demers, & albert ( 1997 ) based on the kinematic signature of a polar ring in the kpc - scale resolution disk data. the difference between the carbon star model and the pseudo - isothermal model may account for the excess lmc microlensing signal recently reported by kim et al. ( 1998 ). to assess the significance of our model, we subtract a model contribution to the observed disk velocity dispersion in quadrature by @xmath0 = 15.7, 13.8 and 20.5 km s@xmath1 in the plane of the disk,, and two solutions with the same mass - to - light ratio. we find that the model rotation curve is best fit by the truncated - disk model, with the observed circular velocity in the line of sight of the bar increasing with increasing radius. the model produces the same polarized gas rotation curve as the observed lmc rotation curve, with a power - law index of 2.1 ( i.e. a square root of 4 ) for 25.6 % of the mass in the model carbon stars, and is marginally disfavored by the additional contribution of gas to the rotation curve. this is compatible with the kelvin - helmholtz limit, but the model does not provide a unique solution for the extreme case of a solar neighborhood disk with a central surface density normalization of 0.0020.0003 @xik2. the constant thickness minimal disk model ( which has the same central surface surface density as the proportional counterclockwise asymmetric disk model ) gives the best fit to the polarization data of the binary lmc carbon stars. we also compare our model with an asymmetric binary model in which the carbon stars are surrounded by a ring of tidal debris. we conclude that the former is not necessary to explain the polarization signal.
in this work we propose a new principal components analysis method to analyze time series belonging to a set of time series that may be extracted from a wide range of physiological time series. we show that it provides a reliable way to extract a detailed information about the connectivity structure of the brain. as an application we consider the gene expression time series of the hela cell, a cell culture isolated from a human uterine cervical carcinoma. the functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) data of this cell show clear causal relations between genes associated with cell cycle regulation and tumor development, suggesting that the system under consideration may be modelled in terms of a few modes, each of which is mapped onto a different bivariate structure. the proposed approach may be applied to other networks, e.g., the subcortical hairpin network or the executive control network of a cell. time series from spontaneous activity signals of healthy subjects and epileptic patients have been extensively studied as a model system to investigate the relation between brain function, function, and change of function. many authors have contributed to this topics, using observations such as time series identification, biostatistical inference, modularity and principal component analysis. according to the current study, the functioning of the human brain may be classified into several modes @xcite. in general, w.r.t. the modules are called modes, for each mode corresponds to a different type of action, and the predictions of the future of that mode may be determined by the available information about its future. a primary step in this direction is to identify the modules of the system that play an important role in its dynamics ; otherwise, little is known about the modules and their possible roles in the system. another important step is to establish with whom the system may be connected in a detailed way, i.e., which modules may play the main role in the decision making process in relation to the development of the disease. several methods have been proposed to tackle this issue, based on different criteria for identifying the modules, or attempting to determine which modules are associated with which genes, in order to obtain a better understanding of the actual patterns of brain function. based on these methods, it has been argued that the number of modules, @xmath0, of a living organism may be reduced to a few ( or few ) degrees of freedom, depending on its functional information. intuitively, this number of freedom may be related to the dynamical characteristics of the living organism ; in other words, the modules may
we present a new way to communicate between _ mathematica _ and form using feyncalc and other external programs. the method ` formlink ` uses two named pipes to execute form, and receives the symbolic expressions of the functions in form. if functions option is set to ` ` functions'in form, then form will run form, reads the commands defined in the parameter space of the pipe, and retrieves the results back to the detailed usage of pipe declarations which are not identified automatically, for example as ` ` $ m2form '' and ` ` form2fc. '' the option ` ` replace ` is used to add a list of string replacements to the base program form. the new method can be used to automatically translate expressions from form to standardform, mathematica_/form, and vice versa. we present a few examples using the formlink program and show how to use it for a variety of user - purposes. = 1 * program summary * _ title of program _ : formlink + _ catalogue identifier _ : adua + _ program obtainable from _ : http://www.formlink.org + _ licensing provisions _ : gnu gpl version 3.0 + _ programming language used _ : mathematica + _ computer _ : any computer with a fortran 77 compiler + _ operating system _ : linux, macosx, windows + _ ram required to execute _ : depends on the program, approximately @xmath0 mb, as large as several 100 mb for 1 to 32 bits per program + _ has the code been tested on linux, and windows? _ : yes + _ number of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc. _ distribution format _ : gzipped tar archive + _ nature of physical problem _ : + form is an interactive form program written in form : it calculates functions, returns the results of those functions, and runs form programmatically from them. + _ method of communication _ : given a set of named pipes, the code can be initialized using any named function ( e.g., function cfunctions, functions myoperator, etc... ), and then the output is read - only by type. this method of initialization is easier to use for an intuitive command - line user interface ( cmd ) than the more sophisticated form code, and is implemented very simply by using the pipes method of hot code generation. the program is easy to learn and use, produces high quality output form, runs in ascii decimal format, and
darwinian adaptation spontaneously emerges from the processes of mutation, reproduction and competition, and these features need to be mirrored in any model of adaptation. however, how the evolutionary fate of populations depends on a small number of pioneers '', distinguished by their growth rates, migration rates, or other characteristics correlated with long - term survival. most analyses of these inherently stochastic problems have focussed on the mean behavior of the population, which sensitively depends on fluctuations in the pioneer populations. here we show that fluctuations can be analyzed in principle, if one relies on minimal models that reduce the dynamics to two essential ingredients : ( 1 ) birth, death and jumps give rise to a branching random walk. ( 2 ) a non - linear population regulation makes sure that those branching processes do not get out of control. for such constrained branching random walks, we have provided a general route towards analyzing fluctuations. the basic idea is to adjust the population control, an essential non - linality, in such a way that the equations describing correlation functions of order @xmath0 are closed. our simulations reproduce the universal velocity - population size relationship and the coalescence time scaling that have been established for fkpp waves over the last 20 years @xcite. we find that the decay of genetic diversity scales as a power of population size for large population sizes. moreover, we show a marked anticorrelation between wave speed and the concentration field of the random walkers. in models of adaptation tuned to be closed at the second moment, the wave speed is exponentially distributed, while the homogeneous, multi - time traveling wave is considerably slower. while the latter relies on the presence of heterotic populations, the former needs to be distributed in a nearly uniform manner. adaptation, invasion, fluctuation, genetic diversity, time scaling
we use the infrared 7.7 @xmath0 m band luminosity of the young starburst nucleus of the markarian galaxy sample ( galex ) to determine the star formation rate ( sfr ) as measured in the rest - frame ultraviolet continuum. sfr(pah ) is an independent and relatively well - defined measure of starburst luminosity since it does not require an understanding of the dominant source of dust extinction in the ultraviolet. for sources detected by iras and having mid - infrared and/or radio continuum data, we determine the equivalent width of the pah bandpass which is the locus of the hot interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) at rest frame 153 nm. we take a random sample of 76 starbursts having high - quality irs spectra of late - type stars having strong pah emission to determine their star formation rates ( sfrs ). the comparison with other well - characterized ` ` starburst galaxies '' ( such as galaxies with strong ultraviolet continuum emission lines, mips and irac ) shows that the sfr of the ` ` pure starburst '' sample is typically a factor of 50 less than that of the galaxies with weaker pah features. adopting an empirical calibration of the infrared pah luminosity, we find that the difference is small compared to other, commonly used indicators of sfr such as the mean ultraviolet luminosity ( uv / optical ) and radio ( vla ). we use the measurement of the ultraviolet extinction for the starburst sample to determine an empirical upper limit on the extinction for sfr as determined from the vla, radio, and uv continuum luminosity to compare with independent measures of extinction that arise from ultraviolet and infrared measurements. we find little or no correlation between extinction and sfr. this result is consistent with previous results that find that extinction is a decreasing with increasing uv luminosity. in sum, the infrared and the ultraviolet measurements of extinction are both consistent with a decreasing cosmic sfr and a decreasing galaxy sfr, although this trend may require corrections for large corrections in the local sfr density.
we present the results of @xmath0-body simulations designed to study the evolution of halo clustering and the corresponding bias. the simulations have evolved four cosmological models : an early universe with cold dark matter ( cdm ), a late universe with hot cdm ( ecdm ) and a newtonian universe with strong cooling. the purpose of our study is to compute the correlation function and the bias for _ all _ dark matter halos, including those inside groups and clusters. to assure that halos do survive in clusters the force resolution we have stressed that the identification and use of halos located inside the virial radius of other halos ( satellites or sub - halos ). the clustering of the latter can be studied without inclusion of complicated physics ; it has been modelled using both direct numerical simulations and analytical methods. the correlation functions we obtain are in very good agreement with estimates already published in the literature. we also compare our results with the apm galaxy correlation function obtained from galaxy surveys. although the conventional statistical definition of the bias depends on a variety of processes that may lead to nonlinearity, our results indicate that the bias is _ scale - independent _ in all models. our results are also consistent with the observation of the galaxy distribution as a function of density fluctuations in the dark matter. n+t=0.5 cm cosmology : theory large - scale structure of the universe methods : numerical x - rays : galaxies : clusters. # 1to 0pt#1 _ accepted to the astrophysical journal _
we present new microlensing observations of stars in the central 8 by 8 of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) obtained with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cf. zhao 1997 ). the data provide a census of the stellar distribution along the line of sight to the lmc and a picture of the possible origins of the observed population of intervening red clump ( rc ) stars. we find that the integrated optical depth of the rc stars is 0.07 mag when plotted as a function of magnitudes and that the ubvi - corrected value for the ratio of the luminosity to the visual magnitude is @xmath0 = 2.2. we identify a previously unknown extension of rc stars toward brighter magnitudes that lies 0.9 mag above the redclump centroid in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the lma. the extension is clearly seen in all four filters of the hst data and is unambiguously real. we explore various explanations for the feature, including unresolved stellar blends, both random and correlated, stellar evolution, composite stellar populations, patchy extinction, a galactic disk population, and an intervening stellar population at a distance of about 35 kpc. the latter explanation is the most consistent with the data. the photometry and the inferred density of the proposed foreground population are consistent with what would naively be expected from a population of origin with a projected surface density that is only a few percent of the total lmc stellar surface density. we conclude that the vrc is most likely an intervening population parallel to the major lmc rotational path, in the direction of the galaxy s orbit, and is unlikely to be distributed in a tidal stream. the observed vrc stars have a mean radial velocity that may differ from that of the rcs by up to 200 km s@xmath9 with a relatively small dispersion. even if an alternative interpretation for the observations is found to be principally correct, this result suggests that placing limits on the foreground population in the outer lmc is extremely difficult, and that a detailed determination of the density of such stellar populations is required in order to constrain the inferred foreground population to well under 5 % of the global halo density.
we study the nuclear effects in inclusive gluino production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc. our analysis is limited to leading - order ( lo ) calculations, where the partonic cross - sections for the production of squarks and gluinos in hadron collisions are calculated at the born level. we find a significant enhancement of the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor, which can be explained by the presence of two nuclei. the enhancement is even larger for the hkn, with a very tiny increasement with @xmath0. we compare our results to those obtained in the different theoretical scenarios, and conclude that the nuclear shadowing and the susy breaking parameters are the main culprit for the different nuclear ratios. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 050 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * * + + + _ submitted to _ eur. phys. j. c _ * # 1 * + _ einstein - podolsky - rosen ( eps ) _ the eps collaboration g.abbiendi@xmath1, k.p. khalaidov@xfig.com _ + _ accepted for publication in _ phys. lett. _ * number of pages * + gr - q this paper is dedicated to the memory of our dear friend and colleague, beate naroska. in the last years, the collaboration has been at the center of a very fruitful research activity, and there will always be a part of it that we would like to thank. beijing national laboratory for condensed matter physics ( cptp ), institute of physics, chinese academy of sciences, + p.o. box 2735, beijing 100080, people s republic of china + e - mail : biplob@iphy.ac.cn + _ short title : physics and applications in proton - proton collisions _
this seminar summarizes our recent work on the connection between the algebra @xmath0 and the super - poincar dualities of super - euclidean, anti - de sitter and conformal algebras. the main goal of this course is to describe t - dualities between all these algebraic dualities, and to understand when it is necessary to look for them in the different theories that are related to the supersymmetric f - theory, the minkowski string theory in 11 and 12 dimensions, and the iia and iib string theories in 10 dimensions. in this work we identify the set of ` translations ', distinguishing between different lagrangian theories for the same spacetime signature, and between algebraic and spacetime signatures. this allows to identify the translation operators that perform translations in one theory and remain as central charges in the other. apart from the weyl projection to chiral spinors, this leads to a set of sixteen possible time - reversal symmetries for the different operators. we take a look at the candidates for these translations, and choose one of them as a ` translation'operator. for the iib algebra, we find three candidates for translations : translations may appear as inner charges of scalar operators, while for the ads algebra and for the superconformal algebra they appear as outer charges of the scalar ` central'operators. for a generalization of this, one can choose either a translation operator, either as a central charge of a vector operator, or a hamiltonian operator. we also find a positive operator that is a part of the timelike form of the real algebra. in all these cases we can identify the expression of that operator with positive eigenvalue. it turns out that the statement made in @xcite is valid for all these operators. in particular cases, in the case of the central charge case, it is sufficient to be able to classify all the realizations of the particular real superalgebra that we consider, as being the algebra of 32 fermionic charges. * rsum : * 0.5 cm * # 1*_#1 _ # 1([#1 ] ) pacs : 12.60.-i, 11.30.jv, 12.20.-p, 03.70.+k # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 11 # 1= to [ section ] # 1 eqnnum ( [ # 1 ]
we re - analyze all archival _ chandra / acis _ observations of pre main - sequence ( pms ) stars in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ), resulting in a sample of 220 stars with known rotation periods. we find that stars with optically determined rotation periods are significantly more x - ray luminous, and are more likely to be x -ray variable, than stars with optical rotation periods that have not yet been detected. the bias to high x - rays is not due to the magnitude ( or even the absence ) of optical rotators on the main sequence, as we show that the small amplitude of optical variability largely prevents us from detecting the rotation periods in stars with radii larger than a few @xmath0. stars without rotation periods appear to be in the super - saturated ( i.e., saturated vs. saturated ) regimes of the x / rotation relationship. in addition, we find a statistically significant correlation in which stars with faster rotators have lower _ xmm - newton _ luminosities. but other results are also found. stars with rotation periods being slower than the saturation " value show a range of luminosity in xmm-@xmathnewton that is comparable to that observed on the major sequence. these stars may be the linear " members of the rotation/x - ray relationship. we also find evidence for a lower incidence of _ active accretion _ among weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ). however, we also argue that this result is inconsistent with the recent findings from a study based on a limited sample of pms stars in taurus - auriga, which appear to show no evidence for an enhanced accretion due to to the presence of magnetospheric accretion columns. lastly, we present a simple model that explains the differences between the rotator and accretion populations in terms of the peculiarity of flaring relative to non - accretors. it suggests that differences in the column density of the accretion disks are the most likely explanation.
we report the results of observations of the ic4954/4955 region in the galactic mid - plane with both the infrared camera ( irc ) and the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope by akari. the mid - infrared images at 9, 11, and 18@xmath0 m have revealed several distinct structures in the region, particularly they show three arc - like structures that seem to have been created by stellar winds from the existing b - type stars. the regions where the gas and dust emission are concentrated are similar to those in the elephant trunk nebula. the dominant amount of dust emission in between the two nebulae is dark in the _ s9w _ color image, suggesting that the amount of active dust - emitting regions in this region is systematically smaller than that in the corresponding region of the irc wide - band images. the temperature and the contribution of thermal dust emission from ionized gas, in which the dominant optical feature is the [ neii]12.8 @xmath1 m line at 6.2, 7.7, 8.5, and 11.2@xfig0 m, are systematically smaller in presence of the infrared reflectors than in the uir band, indicating the presence of a small scale structure there. the location of the exciting young stellar objects ( ysos ) is shifted south - west of the central region, whereas the surrounding region is more quiet. the ratio of the [ sii ] / [ nii ] flux ratio indicates that the yso optical depth ratio is increasing with the distance from the source center to the north - west, which is consistent with the estimated distance of the cluster associated with the rslund 4, 4myr and 2.9kpc. this suggests that triggered star - formation over the three generations in a different spatial scale in ic49 54/49 55 has occurred. the present observations also suggest that the region is embedded in a bubble of small scale, which seems to be triggered by the second generation of stars.
by studying a prototype system of kaonic nuclei ` ` ` @xmath0 '', a complex scaling method ( cccsm ) based on chiral su(3 ) potential, we have succeeded in obtaining the upper bound energies and eigenstates of the three - body system. the binding energy and the decay width are found to be different depending on the combination of the method ( variational approach / faddeev - ags ) and the potential ( phenomenological or chiral - theory based ). from that time, further studies on the system have been carried out with variational methods. in the earlier studies, due to the large energy dependence of the hamiltonian, the method has been applied to the two - body kaonic system only and the lack of knowledge about the physical properties of such a system had seriously limited studies on it. in this work, we propose a convenient method to reduce such a coupled - channel problem to a single - channel one, namely, we can employ the combined process of cole - lepage and feshbach projection in both the coordinate and coordinate - space problems, which gives us an efficient way to solve an equation in coupled - channels effectively as a single problem. with this method, the total number of particles in the csm increases as a function of the scaling angle and the eigenstate as a definite pole on the complex - energy plane is obtained. we have confirmed that the obtained results are consistent with the reported experimental results, which have been reported in the literature. on the other hand, the difference in the angular distribution of the binding energies and decay widths between the two systems is rather limited. actually, it is possible to obtain a much larger binding energy of about 100 mev and a small decay width of about 60 mev by using the obtained real - space expansion of the inner region of the finite - size finite - nuclear - system, which means that the present method can be applied to other many - body systems as well.
we study aspects of quantum kinetics in a relativistic kinetic model that allows to compare approximate treatments of the relaxational dynamics to exact solutions. the model that we have studied allows us to explore the concept of the formation time of a quasiparticle by providing a local update equation to the usual markovian description. off - shell effects are incorporated in a boltzmann description by following the parton distribution function through perturbative parton scattering. we provide a comparison of the exact and approximate solutions in the limit of a continuum distribution of the bath oscillators. with this approximation we discuss the time evolution of an initially prepared density matrix through the thermalization stage and the onset of the quark - gluon plasma in local thermodynamic equilibrium. the dynamics is analyzed from the point of view of the experimental signatures associated with the formation and evolution of the qgp as well as the chiral phase transition. we study in detail how the distributions of particles, both bare and dressed, are affected by the dynamics and provide numerical tests of the approximation / description. the validity of coarse - grained approximations in relation to relaxation is assessed in terms of the time scales for thermalization and thermalization for different distributions of the partons. in particular, we find that an approximation that is obtained by extracting the distribution functions from inside the non - local time integrals, but taking the interval of time to infinity, offers a viable description, which is close to the exact evolution and that of multi - scale non - relativian kinetics at weak and intermediate coupling. implications for field theory are provided by our results. we seek to provide a basis of practical tests of recent predictions for the dynamics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. we envisage that our analysis will lead to a better understanding of the anomalous dynamics of plasmas and to the requirements of quantum field theory to explain the properties of these systems.
we review the interplay between charge density, thermodynamics and macroscopic quantum processes and their role in defining long range order in biological systems. we focus on the development of a new theoretical framework for the description of molecular assembly in plant structures, recently identified from measurements of the superconducting gap @xmath0 in htsc cuprates, where quantum criticality leads to the emergence of a wide range of fractal structures. the quantum processes we consider are described by a system of two - component [ coherent ( boson)-classical [ fermion ] systems. molecular assembly operates within the framework of a charge induced coherent bosonic field, acting as a structuring force in competition with the exterior potentials. whilst the system is only partially coherent, many of the phenomena that have been observed in standard quantum mechanics ( qm ) are recovered, including the quantization, non - dissipation, self - organization, and variation of the strength of the fractal free potential ( mqp ), suggesting that these phenomena are consistent with a quantum - mechanical origin. as evidence for the validity of the proposed principles, we consider a number of examples, including cell wall assembly in _ arabidopsis thaliana _, the deposition of cellulose in secondary wall thickening in _ cellulose synthase _ and cell walls in _ campi _, and the pseudogap formation in _ pseudomonitor _ cells. the unfolded structures we describe exhibit a range of structures of increasing spatial, temporal and spatial coherence, including pod, flower, plant and leaf - like structures, and describe a few of the physical mechanisms leading to long - range order, including : ( i ) the control of local excitation conditions ; ( ii ) local control over excitation temperatures and charge densities associated with photoautorophage ; ( iii ) perturbation theory ; and ( iv ) the possibility of direct interaction between quantum fluctuations and cellular structures, in particular cell walls and their interactions with the environment. the freedom to self - organize and self - concentrate in photosynthetic photosynthesis makes these three - dimensional fractal systems the ideal paradigm for the realization of a ` living science ', offering new insight into how biological systems respond to and respond to environmental fluctuations.
we investigate the effect of mechanical strain on the electronic properties of buckled arsenene. the strain is subjected to three geometric structures, namely ( i ) puckered, ( ii ) planar and ( iii ) buckled for both compressive and tensile strain, where the geometric structures of the three structures are selected based on the anisotropy of the electronic band structure. our phonon spectra reveal that half of the phonon modes are raman active and they are 97, 112, 215, 217, 247 and 253 @xmath0 6 with the [7]-tension point group symmetry at the position of the bend at the brillouin zone. there is an indirect band gap of 0.831 and 1.635 ev, respectively, for both strain directions. around the equilibrium geometric structure, the total energy of the system shows a parabolic behaviour, while the bond length and angle show nearly linear variations. the buckled amphia remains as a direct - gap semiconductor for a wide range of strain. we have also subjected the strain to bulk grey arsenic. we find that the bond lengths of the two - dimensional structures are less than that in bulk arsenic. the indirect - to - direct gap transition occurs at a 4.2 v / nm. we show the evolution of the band gap as a function of electric field. in the case of black phosphorus, the direct band gap is distinctly different from the direct gap at the centre of the fermi energy. this difference is relevant for several applications, including semiconductor - semimetal transition and semiconducting - metallic transition. + * keywords * : buckled structure, semiconductivity, metallicity, pairing
i describe a branch of physics that, in addition to containing the electroweak symmetry breaking majorana triplet and two color sextet quarks, could also contain a new, massive, hadronic sector that dominates high - energy cross - sections : the bound - state s - matrix. this sector, qud, has only standard model interactions and minimal matter, is non - perturbatively free and does not require an _ off - shell _ coupling to explain small neutrino masses. its only member is the critical pomeron. qud could, therefore, provide an amazingly economic underlying unification for the standard model, while also producing neutre masses. i outline my understanding of only a small part of the structure of dtr amplitudes in qud. since @xmath0 is so small, perturbative reggeization is a small effect, reflected only in small masses for the, zero color and charge, neutrinos. _ * the only new physics to be discovered is that of a high mass sector, not bound - states. the only physics that is consistent with the established standard model is that that gives primordial masses and scales. there is no higgs! there are no massive right - handed gauge interactions, no massive left - handed couplings, and no _ ad hoc _ unification of scales and interactions. _ the only real physics we have is the anomaly - driven higgs sector, which is massive and has real - world consequences for qcd and the early universe. the main arguments are : _ * all elementary leptons and quarks would be confined and remain massless. * infinite - momentum masses are enhanced by anomaly poles involving zero - momentum chirality transitions. * * the spectrum of standard model form will be a superposition of the ordinary higgs spectrum plus the high - mass sector. this spectrum will be explained by early universe stable matter formation, and will also explain the cosmic ray knee! the wide, _ i.e. _, very small, _ qud _, in which quarks have zero mass and become the longitudinal components of massive electroweak partons ( the triplet quark ), implies that there is an increase in the production of such ` ` clumps '' at high energies, and that this new sector is responsible for the dominance of dark matter production during the epoch of cosmic hadronicity. the multi - regge region involves multiple infinite - momenta that allow ` ` universal wee partons '' to play this role in the reggeon diagram construction
topological insulators ( superconductors ) are gapped phases of non - interacting fermions which exhibit topologically protected boundary modes. these boundary states are gapless, with extended wavefunctions, and protected against arbitrary deformations ( or perturbations ) of the hamiltonian. the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) is the best known example of such a phase. when describing a gapped topological insulator in the bulk, the system may be characterized by an integer chern / winding number ( or a @xmath1 quantity ). thus the topological features must be properties of translationally _ not _ invariant hamiltonians. we will consider the ` ` ten - fold '' way of classifying the properties of ` ` symmetry protected '' topological states. this is the framework within which the basic ideas of the present classification scheme are formulated. consider the gapped phase of any superconductor describing the time - reversal and charge - conjugation ( or particle - hole ) symmetries of a unitary quantum system. the problem is formulated in the basis of the spin - dynamics of a single particle hilbert space. this problem can be solved by imposing a conformal field, or by solving a non - heisenberg double problem. for a generic system, the answer is that one can have three distinct ` ` topological ordered '' phases separated by a quantum phase transition. here we imagine for convenience of notation that we have ` ` regularized '' the system on a lattice, and if relevant, of additional quantum numbers such as e.g., a pauli - spin quantum number. subsequently, based on theoretical considerations and experimental measurements, the _ different _ topological phases within a quantized version of the superconducting transition will be labeled by different topological invariants. for example, the quantum spin hall effect, predicted theoretically in a hgte/(hg, ce)te semiconductor quantum wells, will be denoted by a ` ` chiral '', or ` ` sublattice '', topological phase.
we present an analysis of the _ ginga _ and _ hst _ observations of the black hole x - ray binary nova muscae in the _ transition _ state made between 1991 january 9 and april 1 and find that : \1 ) the optical / uv spectrum was self - consistently modeled by sum of black body emission from the outer regions of an accretion disk. \2 ) the spectrum during the soft state was in a soft component with a photon spectral index of @xmath0, \3 ) the hard component was present in the spectrum from mid - february to april and \4 ) the energy spectrum was a power law with an index of 0.3 suggesting that the source was in the ultra - soft state. observation by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) satellite and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) enabled us to place the most stringent constraints to date on the location and nature of the advection dominated outer keplerian disk. we find that the outer region of the disk has to be optically thick and not optically thin as has been assumed in previous studies. the extreme uv / optical state was not observed by iue during the outburst. we define the total luminosity of the source as the ratio of the observed radiative luminosity to the luminosity expected from a non - advective outer disk. this definition is consistent with the high values found for other black hole systems. we then constrain the black body spectrum from the disk outer regions to be the soft component only for a specific choice of radii and radii. for this purpose we allow for the inner disk radius to be larger than 5 kpc. \5 ) when the source is in the transition state, its radiative fraction is lower than the value expected from an advected disk, the accretion rate is less than the estimated normalization for the system and the total energy is radiated below the eddington limit. \6 ) if the transition occurs at a radius of 100 kpc the radative fraction could be significantly lower. these results are consistent with those found for cygnus x-1.
the structure and evolution of contact binaries is investigated by means of a new model which evolves a contact binary with different mass ratios and contact degrees according to the roche potential. the model represents the evolution of a w - subtype contact system during a considerable time of the contact phase when the two stars reach thermal equilibrium. during this time, the surfaces of both components lie on the same equipotential surface, and energy is transferred between them. the energy transfer takes place in the outermost layers of the common envelope for w - type systems, and the results are compared with period - colour and light curve data. the former is found to be consistent with the lucy thermal equilibrium model, whereas the latter is in conflict with the equal entropy condition in zero age contact binaries. contact binary evolution, thermal relaxation oscillation, light curve paradox, energy transfer late - type, short period, shallow contact binaries are found to exist in some young as well as in old galactic clusters. the contact degree ( @xmath0 per cent ) is extremely small in most of the cases, and increases as the system evolves towards a more extended common envelope with smaller total mass and a deeper common envelope. contact binaries with mass ratio larger than about 0.2 could be created in the solar neighborhood, and they should be found in young ( a few gyr ) and old ( g and a ) clusters. in addition, in the present model, the surviving stars in contact may have contributed significantly to the mass growth of the cluster, and such systems may be responsible for the formation of the observed population i stars. further, we find that there is a region of energy transfer, above the inner roche critical surface, where the stars are in good contact, and where the ratio of their masses is greater than unity. we estimate that this region could cause the increase in the mass ratio of the system, and thus its increase in contact degree.
we observe multi - photon coherence of single and entangled photons through the interference of two and four photons generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion with delayed photons at the black hole in a three - mode of the bunimovich effect. we show that the choice of the detection event is crucial for the shape of the observed interference signal, and that a unique coherence time can not be assigned to a single - photon state, but depends on the chosen event. furthermore, we find that the widths of the two- and four - photon interference signals exhibit opposite tendencies for increasing number of photons, which can be understood from the strong interference exhibited by a fock - state with exactly one indistinguishable photon. the study of multi - particle interference is one of the most important areas of quantum optics, and has been analyzed through a wide range of techniques, including single- and double - photon experiments @xcite, as well as two - photon and three - photon measurements via the measurement of the coherence between a single photon and a doublet of photons or between two photons with quantum numbers greater than one ` ` photon '' ( bs ) and two ` ` photons '', respectively ( see fig. [ fig : bfkl ] ). a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon can be obtained from the analysis of the different detection schemes : ( i ) either all four detectors are placed at the same time, which is commonly referred to as coincidence detection, or two separate detection schemes are used, i.e. ( ii ) the detection at one output port results in distinct paths for photons with different values of the indistinguishability, ( iii ) or two - fold coincidence detection by two different methods, respectively. in this paper, we experimentally investigate the latter method, and, consequently, we show how it is possible to measure for the first time the _ single_-photon coherence times via the width of the multi- photon signal.
we derive the 2nd rank bi - tensor of geodesics straddling the causal boundaries of an arbitrary spacetime event @xmath0, the qmetric, and identify the geometric significance of the _ very low energy _ volumetric deformation of space - like objects in presence of a short distance cut - off, suggesting a very natural transmutation of the standard description of gravitational dynamics based on the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action. in order to do so, we first identify the correct geometric variables ( geodesic, radial surface curvature, etc. ) that can describe spacetime geometry down to the smallest scales. in particular, we identify the _ maximally symmetric _ van vleck determinant ( vvd ) as a key ingredient to describe the extrinsic curvature of arbitrary curved spacetimes in a geometrical sense. then, using covariant taylor series, we find the exact expression for the maximal extramixing radius of a minimally flat space(time ) formed by linearized versions of the vvd. in absence of such a framework, the resulting geometries are non - perturbative and non - symmetric. the key to understanding the experimental fact that gives rise to such a minimal spacetime length is the adoption of an observer dependent, observer dependent redefinition of the lorentz invariant, as originally suggested by einstein @xcite. this redefines the notion of entropy. as a result, the standard theories of quantum gravity can no longer be used to describe accurately the small scale structure of spacetime. the above results have deep implications for understanding better the notions of entropy and for the _ emergent gravity _ paradigm, such as the ` emergent spacetime model ', particularly exemplified by the recently discovered decoupling structure in the gr theory. we further show that vvd is not the only geometric term that is naturally associated with the existence of a minimal length, but is in fact the only geometrically significant geometric variable needed to characterize spacetime at all scales for a consistent set of observer - dependent theories.
we analyze theoretically the multi mode dynamics of an incoherently pumped and homogeneously broadened two level active medium residing in a ring cavity, interacting with a unidirectional plane wave laser field. we find that the time evolution of the electric field is much slower than that of the material variables, as in the single mode limit. the resulting multi mode emission is quasi periodic, its modal intensities are constant and phases are locked. the dynamics of the system is analyzed as a function of the pump parameter @xmath0 and of the amplitude of the coherently broadened medium. pacs number(s ) : 42.50.dv, 42.25.lc, 43.40.+s the technique of coherent light generation ( cgl ) has been successfully applied in many fields of physics, such as condensed matter physics, photonics and optoelectronics, where the free air emission of a material is transformed into a laser field, thus producing a laser beam with intensity that is comparable to the material emission. the principle of cgl is that the coherent light propagation takes place through multiple scattering processes, in such a way that the intensity of the laser is not independent of its phase. the process is linear and can be understood as a superposition of several single mode and group mode solutions, each with its own characteristic phase. one could imagine that these solutions coexist in the total intensity, but this is not the case, because the modes on one side of the spectrum have intensities larger than the corresponding modes on the other side. this situation is clearly equivalent to a class a laser, _ i.e. _ a laser in which the frequency separation between the two phase locked solutions is about 0.02. the combination of the different mode intensities, frequencies and relative phases makes it possible to show that the total intensities for the two solutions are identical. this has been done many times in the literature, see e.g., @xcite. in this paper we continue the analysis of a multi mode laser, with the aim of understanding the pulse structure and the dynamics.
we have used multiple epochs of very long baseline array ( vlba ) radio interferometry to observe a sample of 110 quasars and active galaxies, selected from a flux - density limited, core - selected sample. we find a distribution of apparent jet kinematics between 0 and @xmath0 but with a median speed of, or about. there is evidence for a characteristic velocity in the jets of which may represent the true plasma flow velocity. quasar jets appear to have larger apparent velocities than jets associated with bl lac objects and other jet hosts, although the distributions overlap. our measured values of 0.5 to 1.0 km / s are generally consistent with the values found for the entire radio quasar population. the only significant differences we find between our representative sample and the missing sources may be due to unidentified systematic errors in the determination of the intrinsic lorentz factors of the jets. when compared to published observations of similar sources, the majority of our sources show evidence for non - ballistic motion, with speeds mostly along the direction away from the core. however, in a few sources the flow appears to bend back toward the line of sight. individual jet features often appear to move in the same direction as the continuous flow, but in some cases appear to be moving toward the core with speeds much higher than the intrinsic speeds of the underlying plasma flow. in general, the angular velocity redshift relation appears to be redshift dependent. we have measured redshifts for the individual features and extrapolated the redshift distributions of apparent speeds to determine whether the jets are moving along straight or curved trajectories. the jets in our representative sub - sample have a median angular velocity of, while the sources in the missing sample exhibit a wide range of accelerations. we discuss the implications of these results for currently proposed models of jet formation and the importance of relativistic beaming models in the context of our study.
in order to gain information about the spectral properties of a complex environment we analyze its influence on the dynamics of a quantized information carrier, i.e. a qubit, interacting with a classical stochastic field. two different field spectra will be considered : the lorentzian spectrum generated by a random telegraph noise and the @xmath0 colored spectrum stemming from a collection of random bistable fluctuators. in both cases the noise induced by the classical field is described by a non - gaussian process, meaning that the sole knowledge of the second - order statistics is not sufficient to fully characterize the process. we consider two regimes of the noise, namely, the slow rtn and the fast rtn regimes. in the former case we find that the fisher information coincides with the quantum fisher information and the fisher exponent can be optimized by choosing the interaction time and the switching rate according to the optimal interaction time maximized by the qubit preparation, in agreement with the cramer - rao inequality. regarding the latter case, by studying the evolution of the so - called quantum noise interference regime ( qsnr ) with respect to the environment we establish a bound on the ultimate precision with which any unbiased estimator can be estimated. the goal of an estimation procedure is not only to determine the value of an unknown parameter, but also to infer this value with the largest possible precision. based on these results we discuss optimization of parameter estimation by quantum probes. estimating a physical quantity as a function of the environment is extremely important for a wide range of applications, ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to biology, quantum information and quantum computation. in this paper we address the optimization of the estimation of parameters of a system subject to noise by using quantum probes as the ultimate limit of the precision achievable in estimating a parameter. we analyze in detail the dependence of the qfi on the environment and on the initial state preparation conditions.
we present matad, a package for the computation of massive tadpoles in one, two and three - loop order. the main idea is based on the integration - by - parts method which relates vacuum integrals with different denominator structures. the proper use of the recurrence relations allows the reduction of an arbitrary integral to simple ones, which can be solved by successively using one- and two - loop formulae, and a linear combination of a few so - called master integrals. in particular it is shown how the complete calculation can be automated and one can ensure that all results are indeed up - to - date. the program can be downloaded from the authors site http://www.matad.org/. users are kindly requested to cite this work when publishing or distributing the results obtained with matad. * program summary * * _ title of program : _ matad * _ catalogue identifier : _ * _ program obtainable from : _ cpc program library, queen s university of belfast, n. ireland ( see application form in this issue ). + _ computer for which the program is designed and others on which it has been tested : _ any computer with a fortran 77 compiler + _ distribution format : _ tar gzip file + _ nature of physical problem : _ the evaluation of higher order q - corrections and the prediction of the higgs decay into gluons is one of the most important problems in q - theory, involving a great deal of knowledge about qinematics and dynamics, but also large problems, involving hundreds of different possible outcomes. the calculation of these problems requires a large amount of memory and attention. one has to mention, though, the importance of computing these calculations with a program which is readily available and which is reasonably capable of performing the same calculation for a large number of different diagrams. this program is, therefore, a valuable tool for the study of q - effects and of physical problems with a reasonable price. *
in this paper we present diffraction limited mid - infrared ( 11.7@xmath0 m ) imaging of the central 0.056 of the powerful fr ii radio galaxy in 3c 405 ( cygnus a ), obtained with the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) instrument at the keck i telescope. we clearly detect a thermal infrared bump in the sed, which is a clear signature of a nonthermal active galactic nucleus ( agn ). the strong thermal emission comes from the base of the radio lobe, where reradiation of the absorbed light from the dusty obscuring matter ( torus ) occults the jet. the torus is expected to become optically thick over much of the obscuring region, allowing the pc scale jet emission to be seen over the top. this is a characteristic feature for optically dull agn, in which case the jet power and optical / uv luminosity are comparable to those in double radio quasars. thus this radio galaxy is a moderate luminosity broad line radio galaxy with a very high luminosity radio source. the mid - ir power is @xmath1 ergs / s, a factor of 3 larger than in double fr i radio galaxies with similar luminosities in the hard x - ray ( e.g., m87, ngc 4594 ). we also show that the dust component is not very well isolated in the infrared sed. in fact, a partial spectral energy distribution is found, with a central dominant component that can be approximated by variable synchrotron emission. these findings are consistent with the suggestions by chiaberge et al. for a large number of fainter narrow line radio galaxies, there is no _ a priori _ evidence for the presence of a quasar based on their interpretation of the various emission features. this situation is even less clear for the fr i galaxies, almost all of which have undetectable or low - ionization emission lines. for example, there are only a few in the literature with such low luminosity nuclear sources, the majority of which are believed to be hidden agn. we briefly discuss the implications of our results for the currently active fr i and fr ii galaxies, and in particular m87.
the large aperture telescope1 ( lwa1 ) is a proposed experiment to detect the 21 cm radio signal from the dark ages using the digital beamforming capability of the university of texas at brownsville ( utb ) radio telescope. this would provide a unique window into the radiative properties of the gas that fills the majority of space at early times. we describe the focus of this paper on observational and technical developments for what would be a future radio telescope capable of reaching 10 mhz and beyond, including ( i ) the detection of the signal from all known hot jupiters ( hjs ) in the northern hemisphere, ( ii ) a capability to measure coherent radio emission from multiple sources, ( iii ) a data calibration pipeline with which to reconstruct the full - stokes sky brightness, measure and correct for direction - dependent gains of individual stands, and ( iv ) correct for the effects of refractive offsets created by the ionosphere. we discuss the observational challenges involved in launching and maintaining a large ( @xmath0100 mhz ), field - of - view telescope suitable for this ambitious goal, including foreground subtraction, understanding sidelobe systematics, mitigating radiative irradiation, and coping with ionospheric distortions. we also describe the expected scheduling and data processing requirements for the next ( at least ) generation of telescopes to build and deploy three or more ` ` mini - stations '' for the purpose of monitoring the sky for transient sources. _ talk presented at the international conference on radioastronomy, astrophysics and cosmology, + dark ages and reionization, sesto pusteria, italy, 2012. _to be submitted to the astrophysical journal
we present a systematic study of the effects of roughness geometry on the heat transport in turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) in convection cells with rough plates. the experiments are conducted in three different roughness geometries : ( 1 ) the top and bottom plates of the same convection cell are rough, ( 2 ) the roughness height is of the order of 4 mm, and ( 3 ) the boundary layer is rough. in addition to studying the global transport properties of the system, the heat properties of individual plates with rough / smooth surfaces are also investigated. using flow visualization and near - wall temperature measurements, it is shown that the interaction of the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) and the secondary flow in the grooved region of the rough plate enhances plume emission which leads to the enhancement of heat transport. the study of local temperature fluctuations, suggests that the scaling law of the transport is can be controlled using the nusselt number @xmath0, which is a measure of the turbulent response parameter and the reynolds number, and is parameterised by the 3-d turbulent taylor number @xcite. although there are many similarities between the behaviour of the lsc in a smooth cell and that in rough plates, the two differ significantly in the latter, suggesting that roughness may play an important role in turbulent rbc. in this sense the present study may be classified into three regimes : regime i ) when the top rough plate is the one with the shortest length scale and the shortest boundary layer ( bl ), regime ii ) where the length scale is the same as that of the smooth plate, and iii ) for the cases with longer length scales, the long - wavelength roughness elements and the longest boundary layer are found to be the same. the regime iii ) is found to differ from regime i, ii and iii in the sense that the former is enhanced with the longest length scale, while the latter is reduced, indicating a change of the scaling exponent from 0.28 in an uncorrected rough cell to 0.35 in a rough cell. with the introduction of the problems ( i.e. the problems mentioned above ), the relevant scaling laws become different and the validity of the previous results is discussed.

we present late - time optical spectra of the type iin sn 1998s, taken nearly 14 years ( 1480 days ) after explosion in the nearby galaxy ngc 3877. the oxygen emission - line spectrum exhibits interesting new features, including a complex complex structure in the form of asymmetric p - cygni profiles, that can be interpreted as the result of the interaction between the sn explosion and a slow - moving, ionized circumstellar medium ( csm ) generated by the wind of the progenitor star. analysis of the [ o i ] @xmath0, h@xmath1, and he i emission lines shows that the interaction started well before the smooth transition from nightfall on june 1093, and continues nearly until day 5079. between days 1093 and 5079, the oxygen - to - hydrogen ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.6, with a shift in the line shape that is likely due to increasingly metal - rich sn ejecta crossing the reverse shock. the presence of these narrow emission lines over the last decade is consistent with the scenario that the sn was impacted by the sn blast wave and was illuminated by the csm, and that its velocity was within the range of those predicted by the red supergiant wind superwind ( rsg ; yoon & cantrillo 2010 ) model predictions. we discuss the discrepancy between the observed [ o iii ] line profiles and the predictions of the rsg model, in light of the recent work by fesen et al. ( 2005 ), who have argued that the density profile for the high - velocity ejecta is flatter than that suggested by previous work. we also describe the evolution of several other critically - important features of this object, and others, and discuss the implications of the sn ` ` performance '' in the context of widely - discussed theories for the final stages of massive - star evolution.

a general quantum - object description for the hubbard model on a bipartite square lattice is introduced. the model involves an electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation of the type considered in a previous work. the effective on - site repulsion @xmath0 and the in - plane nearest - neighbor transfer integral @xfig0 are fully consistent with its extended global symmetry in the one- and two - electron subspaces, respectively. the general operator description for that model is based on an expression of the spin - one operator for the lowest - weight state subspace of the model in terms of the effective reduced - state - square - lattice momentum - occupancy configurations. these state representations generate momentum eigenstates that are not in general energy eigenstate representations. as a result, the model has an infinite number of bound and anti - bound spin - less and spin - more charged spinons. the number is exactly equal to the number of electrons in the whole hilbert space for all values of the onsite repulsion and finite spin density. in addition to the infinite - number of spin-@xmath1 states generated by such momentum occupancy configurations, also exists a set of independent one - and - both - electron energy and momentum - state representations that generate the model s global symmetry for any value of the electronic density and spin density at vanishing chemical potential and magnetic field. some of these states are such that they are in quantum - liquid state, but the rest are not so. the origin of those quantum - liquids lies in the fact that the products of the two different unitary transformations into such states commute with each other. it is shown that those quantum liquids have anisotropic anisotropy perturbation being the simplest candidate toy model for describing the effects of electronics correlations in general many - electron problems with short - range interaction on such a lattice. = 10000
we show that minimal flavor violation can provide an explanation for the lack of wimp dark matter candidates at the lhc. this is done within the framework of susy with flavor triality, which imposes holomorphicity on the yukawa spurions. under this hypothesis, the existence of a lepton - flavored dark matter is ruled out at the @xmath0 level, even if the flavor symmetry between the sm and dm is broken at the quantum level. on the other hand, it is allowed to explore the mfv hypothesis for nonsupersymmetric dark matter scenarios, but the latter requires dangerous rpv couplings amongst the first and second generation. fortunately, there are simple symmetries among the superpotential that reconcile both these scenarios. 6.5 in 9.0 in -0.50 in 0.00 in 0sk^0_s ps. 2q^2 2r_2 1spin - one 2gev^2 nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( # 2 ) # 3 # 1#2#3phys. lett. b * # 1*(#2)#3b^2(#3)#4 phys. rev. * d#1*(_#2])#3#1 # 2 jinr. e2@xmath4 # 1 hep - ph/0209004 aue-02 - 02 / kgku-16 - 02 + * * monte carlo simulation of minimal supersymmetry * + a. imamoglu + _ department of physics and astronomy + tufts university, + medford, massachusetts 02155 _ + w. p. grice + _ physics department, university of southampton, + southampton so17 1bj, u.k. _ + g. j. milburn + _ the enrico fermi institute, + chilton, didcot, oxon, ox11 0qx, uk _ +
we present analytical expressions for nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) diagrams for both the electronic self - energy and the spin transfer torque ( stt ) at finite bias voltage in the quasi-1d model of a two - terminal ferromagnetic tunnel junctions ( f / i / f mtj ) embedded in a semiconductor paramagnetic insulator. the latter is calculated by using state - of - the - art matrix gfs in the keldysh space ( which are functions of energy for electrons or frequency for magnons ). we show that the self - consistent solution of the corresponding system of coupled nonlinear integral equations is equivalent to infinite resummation of certain classes of diagrams, thus allowing the derivation of the magnon density of states ( dos ) by usingzagzag diagrams within negf formalism. this allows the extraction of the perturbation expansion of magnon self - energies which is carried by all the gauss - hermite scattering events that occur in the field of mgo - based mtjs. in particular, two - magnon scattering events can be described in a particularly compact form by using the e - h polarization bubble diagram, which takes into account the influence of electrons on magnons while inserting the dressed magnonic gf line into scba diagrams. thus, the development of convenient diagrammatic techniques to deal with non - equilibrium electron - electron interaction, a field which is in the forefront of research at the moment, is the crucial step towards a better understanding of inelastic scattering processes in multi - terminal structures of quantum many - body systems. _ * note : * the original publication contained three errors. the erratum published in eur. phys. j. * a * ( 2012 ) is reprinted in its entirety on the following page. the changes outlined there have been made to the text in this arxiv version, and the variations of @xmath0 in fig.

the task of logistics as a key element of our modern work - sharing economy is to make sure that required resources are delivered in the right quality and quantity to the requesting destination at the right time and acceptable costs. this involves the organization, management, and engineering of suitable technical systems. the struggle for efficiency in logistics is closely tied to the complexity challenge presented by the present complexity challenge. as such, biologistics, an interdisciplinary research field, has been born out of the interplay between engineering and biology, and has become a new, interdisciplinary approach to the logistic phenomena of communication, distribution, and transport. this approach unites engineering and design principles of different branches of nature, uniting biology with complexity science and engineering, and contributes to a new understanding of key processes in biological, technological and social life. in this paper, we start by highlighting some key aspects of logistic systems similar to those of man - made global logistics and explore their dynamic interplay, both in terms of structural and functional design principles. we then concentrate on the analysis from a _ structural _ perspective, i.e., on the design of properties such as robustness, adaptability, and noise control, and explore design principles which allow for flexible adaptation to varying conditions including growth, shrinkage, or reorganization. examples of such multiplexing at the intra- and multi - cellular scale are provided by endocytic and vascular networks, while several types of cargo are transported to specialized compartments ( lysosomes ) for digestion, others for recycling, and sorting in engineered distribution networks. finally, we discuss the possible extension of our approach to explore the dynamics of biological systems in relation to _ dynamic _ organization and systems evolution. the biological systems we study are characterized by a high degree of flexibility in response to varying demands, a considerable sensitivity to changes in demands, large administrative overheads, and, sometimes, system breakdowns. understanding logistic processes in biology is, therefore, a new challenge. the current progress in cell biology can make big contributions to identifying molecular structures and regulation mechanisms.
universities in high - energy heavy - ion collisions provide a unique forum for studying the collisional properties of heavy nuclei. the light weight of nitrogen atoms in the uranium lattice creates an environment where the fundamental vibrational modes of the nitrogen atoms oscillate far more efficiently than in lower energy systems. this has lead to novel spectroscopic signatures in the spectra of low - energy neutrons than previously observed in other systems, such as the quantum harmonic oscillator. we show that the high frequency vibrations in the un single crystal exhibit no fine structure within the instrumental energy resolution and are well - described by a model consisting of a collection of equally - spaced and evenly - spaced oscillator modes. we suggest that this model may be applied to the nuclear fuel - material un. nucl. phys. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) [ cols="<,^, < ", ] ( presented by *??? * p. fermi, f. h. kim, b. a. m. pietryga, and l. zhang, phys. rev. e * 81 *, 06111501 ( 2006 ) ]. h. t. mccusker, a. j. holden, m. atkin, d. bouwmeester, and a. k. ekert, ` ` x - ray scattering from tritons and phonons in metallic hydrides, '' phys.. lett. * 58 *, 154715495545 ( 1993 ). u. leonhardt, h. g. schaadt, r. ralph, j. c. mcphedran, v. s. yakovlev, and y. d. korolkova, solid state physics for binary systems using neutrons from an ultrathin al sample, ". r. b. p. ghosh and p. w. marangos, applied mathematics in applied physics, " class. quantum electron. * 29 *, 13671369 ( 1985 ). a. n. poddubny, n. huse, s. bassler, l. betev, and w. tittel, a neutron collider for high energy nuclear power plants, " j. phys. ref. * 12 *, 06301030 ( 2005 ). x. wang, g. baluschev, q. zhu, x. guo, b
the ` ` 3kpc arm '' of the hi emission in front of the bulge is a prominent large scale feature in the kinematic distribution of galactic hydrogen. the high measured value of the ratio of this velocity to the radial velocity, @xmath0, gives one of the most convincing arguments for non circular motions in the galactic disk, and can be used, for example, to identify stars that have been swept up by a rotating bar into an inner ring. this may be the first unambiguous evidence for the association of the oh / ir halo and the hydrogen, that has survived for 2 galactic revolutions. the ring contribution to the toward a source situated at the centre of a galaxy is typically 30 %, when left alone, assuming a scaleheight of the bar and disk that is half the size of the galaxy. even taking into account the influence of a smaller disk ( or ring ), the rings contribute 30 % to 50 % of the toward the source. the microlensing optical depth ( and thus the mass ) also gives a significant contribution, at the level of 40 %, to the event duration distribution of events in an underlying bulge disk, for some models with a range of bulge and disk parameters. in particular, a ring as large as 12 kpc should be sufficient to explain the lensing optical depth measurements toward several sources, within the range of recent determinations for the initial mass function and the fraction of invisible matter in the solar neighbourhood. we discuss possible models for the geometry of the ring, in which the sources and lenses are embedded in a ring of stars that is oriented almost parallel to the disk. while such a ring should be present in the images of the lmc and ngc 7702, evidence for its existence can not be ruled out in the present day. in the next few years, after the completion of the required observations, the inner ring and the disk will play an important role in the determination of the dark matter content of the inner galaxy. = -0.5 cm [ firstpage ] galaxies : bulge galaxies : kinematics and dynamics galaxies : structure gravitational lensing
the problem of determining the order parameter of a system of @xmath0 ising spins in a three dimensional cubic lattice is analyzed in the quenched spin - glass ( qss ) regime. based on the analysis of the replica - symmetry ( rs ) ansatz introduced by thouless, anderson, and palmer ( sk ) model ( a.k.a. the thouless - anderson model ) it is shown that within the framework of the original mean - field interaction the equilibrium solution of the model in the canonical ensemble predicts a second order phase transition to a low temperature ferromagnetic ( pa ) phase, depending on the parameters of the gaussian distribution of the interactions ( j s ). this phase is characterized by a different microscopic behavior and a different kind of orientation order, giving rise to a characteristic value of the usual mean field order parameter, i.e. the magnetization. using the physical meaning of the two order parameters in the qss regime it is demonstrated that this system exhibits a glassy - like behavior, in the presence of an external magnetic field, which can be interpreted in terms of a replica symmetry breaking. a new order parameter is introduced in the thermodynamic limit of the problem, the polarization, in order to quantify the degree of freezing of the rotators ( spin glasses ). numerical simulations of the polarization using the replica method are performed in a range of temperatures, from very low to very high, for a realistic values of the j s and parameters relevant for realistic material properties. the obtained results compare favorably with previously reported molecular dynamics results for the polarization of the spin glass phase of the hmf model performed in zero temperature microcanonical simulations. it is found that this model can be regarded as a ` ` ` glassy '' phase, in which each pair of spins has a nearly equal probability of having a magnetization per spin ( as in the pa phase ), while in the fe phase the spins point in different directions. the freezing effect is shown to be a by - product of the out - of - equilibrium structure of the quasi - stationary states. frustration is introduced as a new possible mechanism for the glassy behavior of spin - glasses by imposing the steepest possible ground state energy constraint, which in turn leads to an infinite - ranged infinite - range frustration.
we present _ chandra _ x - ray observations of the young supernova remnant rcw 86, which has a @xmath0 km s@xmath1 morphology and has been interpreted as a strongly interacting shell. our spectroscopic data are consistent with the hypothesis that the hard x - rays are synchrotron emission from the ejecta with a large overabundance of iron relative to solar. we identify the bright complex of emission filaments at its sw corner with the location of the reverse shock. this implies that at least part of the sn ejecta has not been stripped off its l - shell electrons. we find that the spectra of the soft thermal emission can be well understood as thermal emission with a small value of ionization time, of order 10 ps. the hard emission can not be reconciled with a thermal model alone, unless either the region has very low abundances of fe, or the emission is from a reverse - shock region. the spectral fits to the hard and soft emission favor the former, while the former is very difficult to reconcile with a reverse shock solution. the lack of hard emission in the sw region further supports the scenario of a strong reverse shock, with the blast wave possibly encountering undisturbed upstream material. however, we can not rule out the possibility of electron acceleration to comparably high energies at the shock, since there is no evidence that nonradiative shocks are present in the remnant. our observations provide no direct evidence of spectral evolution. we defer to a later work a more extensive exploration of the nature the soft emission and possible explanations for the short ionization timescale. however the overall faintness of the emission ( presumably mostly thermal ) is such that a faint nonthermal component might be hard to discern. we summarize our findings and speculate on how such analysis could be extended or modified.
we present a theoretical study of the absorption spectra of the _ r. rubrum _ photo - pigment pigment protein complex. the core complex is modeled with a simple two - level model that includes the symmetric and slightly - perturbed ring and their associated excitation population redistribution. in this simple model light is sequentially redistributed from antenna to @xmath0 pigments, and the dipole - strength redistribution is maximized for intermediate levels of disorder. we compare the results of this design principle with available experimental data and conclude that it provides guidelines for the design of light - harvesting devices that avoid photobleaching. there is a plethora of biological and bio - inspired products that exploit light for their chemical and mechanical properties @xcite. for instance, there is good evidence, from atomic force spectroscopy, that the lh1 ring of the psu from _ rb. _ is robust, and we find that an increase in the cross - section of the rc can be caused simply by the coherent interaction of the rosseland ring and its asymmetric counterpart. in recent years, moreover, another kind of fundamental and practical improvement in light harvesting devices has been reported, for instance the direct re - emission of light photons following photon absorption by _ pseudobulasm _ and _ rumps. _ while these devices are potentially very efficient, their practical applications do not currently exist. _ we identify a fundamental process by which light can be harvested on a very cellular level, and it is commonly referred to as _ foccusing _. this process is fundamentally different from traditional light harvesting, where the guiding of the light leads to a distinct energy landscape, the flip side of which is to the left or right of the receptor molecule. in contrast to the photon - exchange rate, energy is not dissipated as heat is transferred from the cell to the environment, but instead is stored in a torus - like structure that is the basis of efficient light harvesting after a deficiency of a pigment. + to appear in optics express
we present an analysis of the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster. our @xmath0 band lf, when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields, agrees well with the lf of the nearby las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ). however, the normalization of our local lf is roughly a factor of 1.6 higher than that of the stromlo / apm survey. this difference must lie in a systematic photometry error in one ( or more ) of the three surveys. a clue to the nature of this error is provided by examining the mean colors of local norris galaxies. if we assume that the color of a galaxy is determined by its rest - frame luminosity, then the best fitting schechter function is that of an sb galaxy. we therefore do not believe that the population of blue galaxies is evolving with redshift. the evolution of the red galaxy population, reflected in the blue colors, is more likely to reflect an increase in the intrinsic luminosity of star - forming galaxies with redshifts. there is only weak evidence for a steep faint - end slope in the local field lf. environmental influences on galaxy evolution may be reflected in differences between the lfs for galaxies in different environments, and it is therefore important to measure the lft in a variety of environments. both superclusters host a significant population of very luminous galaxies. although the spectra of intermediate - redshift blue galaxies show spectral signs of short bursts of star formation, the majority of these galaxies are expected to be giant ellipticals whose progenitors are likely to be well mixed with the surrounding stellar population. in fact, the galaxies we find are all located in the dense ridge of galaxies between the abell clusters a2061 and a2067, and half of our sample is found in regions in the upper 10th percentile of the surace density.
we study the properties of dark matter haloes extracted from a set of numerical simulations run with the desired cosmological parameters and with the aim of assessing their systematic biases in the determination of the global halo mass function. we apply the full rescaling algorithm, which takes into account the different quasi - linear theory modes in the simulations and the results are compared to those obtained from a reduced version of the algorithm applied to individual particles in the same cosmology. the level of precision attained by the full method is comparable to that obtained from the rescaling of particles and is found to be significantly lower in the case of low halo masses. we study the individual properties of haloes ( the number of particles per halo and their peculiar velocities ), and the mass accretion history of the 10th largest halo in the simulation. the addition of stellar masses to the numerical resolution of the simulation does not change the trend of the position of the haloes with respect to the redshift. we find only mild displacements in the halo merger histories, of only @xmath0 percent, when compared to the corresponding halo histories for the same numerical resolution. larger numerical resolutions do not improve the accuracy in the recovery of halo properties. we also study the extent to which the global statistics of the most massive haloes can be used to determine the history of mergers and to estimate the sizes of the largest haloes. below a critical mass ( corresponding to the virial mass ), the agreement between the rescaled and the reference haloes degrades rapidly, by at least an order of magnitude, over the range of masses considered. this provides an indication of the possible systematic biases that such a population of galaxies would present if they were observed using halo statistics derived from numerical simulations. we discuss these effects in the light of the recent work by barger et al. [ mon. not. r. astr. soc. * 219 *, 285 ( 2010 ) ].
the dose distribution of a proton pencil beam in solid or liquid matter has three parts : the _ core _, the _ halo _ and the ` recoil - nucleus - to - be '. the core / halo consists of the charged secondaries from those interactions : elastic scattering on h, elastic and inelastic scattering on o and the few nonelastic reactions on o. it is, however, only weakly sensitive to the beam range. the halo in water is, beyond any small radius, little affected by the core. the radiative dose deposited by each of these secondaries is the same : @xmath0mev / g / p pc@xmath1. it is therefore much easier to measure this relative dose than other beams. for the first time, we have measured the absolute dose distribution in the entire halo. we compare the results with model - dependent ( md ) and model - independent ( mi ) fits and find that the md fit is worse than the mi fit, but that both are adequate to describe the data. we argue that the substantial ` missing'momentum distributions which occur outside the core are a result of the pervasive role of the bragg peak chamber in the bpc and that these have nothing to do with the intrinsic transverse size of the initial core. using a fluence calibrated plane parallel ionization chamber instead of a reference chamber, it is also possible to obtain absolute dosimetry from a single pencil. we thus claim to have obtained the first unambiguous measurement of the relation between the ` arrival time'of the recoiling proton and the duration of its excitation by a nuclear reaction. our technique will be used as a benchmark for monte - carlo ( mc ) electromagnetic and nuclear models and may prove useful in studying the medium energy reactions which dominate radiative therapy. the remainder of the thesis is devoted to a comparison, in a variety of configurations, of the gate / geant4 mc package for pbs and with measurement.
we study the structural properties of merger remnants from @xmath0cdm cosmologies, as provided by fitting a srsic profile to their luminous and dark mass distributions. this allows us to compare these properties with those found in observational studies, where a bulge - like component is not included. we find several correlations among the total luminous mass, effective radius and central velocity dispersion of the merger remnants, that are found in our simulations. when comparing with observational studies we find that a bulg component is necessary to reproduce the observed relationships. also, the concentration of the light profile follows a concentration pattern similar to that found in intermediate or giant elliptical galaxies. these results suggest that a primordial bulge in spirals is a necessary condition to form bona fide ellipticals in the hierarchical merging scenario ; otherwise a weak bulge would not contribute to the observed correlations. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 * # 2 # 3 _ the messenger _ # 1, en route to the sun, astrofn 3.1. m. a. malygin, a. b. flagg, r. miller, d. m. shapiro, e. s. barnard, w. tittel, and m. binkley, ` ` evidence for a secondary merger in the local universe, '' rev. mod. phys. * 79 *, 124501 ( 2005 ). a. i. lvovsky, m. c. vartanyants, and s. r. wootters,``@xmath1 astronomical satellite, '' science * 312 *, 246248 ( 2004 ). c. t. cole, l. ciurana, g. lemaire, c. j. dunn, and j. d. thibault, " astrophys. j. * 130 *, 433437 ( 2000 ). g. l. dong, '' # 1_#2 _, # 3 ( 19#3 ) # 1#2#3#4#5#6, _ ann. ny. astronomical year _, * # 3 *, # 4 ( 3#4 ) # 10=0.0 in -0.25truein 0.05truein
the evolution of a population of bacteria in a nutrient - poor environment is studied by means of numerical simulations, based on a microscopic cellular automata approach. a strongly non - uniform nutrient environment is envisioned to govern the growth of bacterial colonies, nutrient dissipation and water - based biofilm formation. we find that the hierarchical structure of the population density in the presence of nutrient diffusion is able to explain the time - dependence of the bacterial population, with an exponential growth rate described by a rescaling factor @xmath0, for long times. we suggest that diffusion can be viewed as a phenomenological tool to generate fractal - shaped structures, such as bacterial islands ", once the nutrient is supplied with water. further, we demonstrate that the periodic splittings of neighboring nutrient - rich cells can be regarded as a physical mechanism for the formation of biofilm structures, also observed in the hierarchical population model. finally, we discuss the possible role of diffusion in the morphological organization of the biofilm and suggest that it may provide a new conceptual paradigm for understanding the origin of the scaling characteristic of the large - scale structure observed in microbial populations. the variety and complexity of life on earth is well - known to be driven by the dynamics of eukaryotic cells, driven by osmotic growth and dna - based metabolism @xcite. exponentially growing organisms take advantage of a readily available resources, nutrients and proteins, in order to produce a diverse and abundant population of micro - organisms. a bacterial population is generally composed of cells which consist of those which retain a balance between growth and decay, namely, bacteria and water. the balance between the two different types of cells is the so - called bacillus subtilis or _ petri dish _, present in the environment, and which subsequently find their way to the larger nutrient bowl ", resulting in a spatial structure seen mostly in liquid - gas interfaces, or in surface roughness and possible overhangs. the bacteria therein are essentially independent of the nutrient they are fed on a coarse - grained substrate, consisting of nutrient pillars arranged in a random number of cells ( see fig.1 ). in such an environment, where each cell only needs to eat a single nutrient, the resulting population has a minimal size, leading to a fractal morphology typical of ferns, nematodes or photosynthetic flagellates. two aspects at the core of the complexity of bacterial systems can be responsible for the observed diversity of bacterial morphology. first, bacterial excretion and feeding
the state of a perceptual system is defined as the _ a priori _ part of its relational character, i.e., it is not a part of the whole physical state. characteristic features of this state are the presence of complex forms that are attributed to attributes of the object s relational character. in the usual modal interpretation the just - mentioned states are treated in terms of the so - called states of observers, measuring devices, and other systems, with respect to themselves. this formalism, however, does not address the question of what properties of a given physical system are related to the relational character of the situation on which it is observed. here we will propose an analysis of this subject, based on the formalism of the einstein - podolsky - rosen theory of physical realism, according to which our understanding of the world as a relational entity is significantly modified. the states assigned to physical systems by this theory are non - relational, monadic, predicates that have a relational origin. instead of the usual case in which properties of objects are independent of any viewing perspective and can be represented by monadic predicates, we will focus on the situation in which a measurement is performed on a macroscopic object, independently of any outside observer, and the results are interpreted as due to the effects of an interaction between the object and its environment. we will then use the standard definition of measurement as the whole apparatus ( the bell s theory ) to determine the state of this object, after having performed a measurement on it, and we will relate it to a larger system, a reference system, of which is a part. a very general description of the perceptual systems of nature ( perceptual properties are assigned according to the rules of quantum theory ) will be explained, in the light of the recent results of bell s theorem @xcite. the purpose of this paper is twofold. first, the goal is to give a new interpretation, with a relational point of view, of some basic features of the quantum theory, and to propose a modified definition, in which the definition of quantum states is modified in comparison with the traditional notion of physical reality. the modifying notion of quantum reality persists even in the more general case of perceptual systems. the whole scenario to be investigated is rather simple, in relation to what we will refer to as the ` display'system. state @xmath0 is a projection operator that projectors one and two dimensional one - dimensional objects that are embedded in a two - dimensional projection onto a three - dimensional
the production of heavy @xmath0-nuclei in the nucleosynthetic environment of a neutron star is not solely associated with a single astrophysical source. there are several different avenues for producing such nuclei including : ( 1 ) a low - mass star, ( 2 ) a core - collapse supernova, ( 3 ) an accretion - induced collapse of an o - ne - mg core, or ( 4 ) those of a white dwarf in a binary system. we here investigate all of these possibilities considering observations of abundances for a wide variety of elements in metal - poor stars as well as the solar system and their dependence on the neutron star mass. the metal composition varies considerably with star to star but the patterns for the gross abundances of c, n, o, and ne are generally in good agreement with the observations. the pattern for the solar isotopic yields is also found to be close to the solar pattern. this apparent universality does not necessarily imply the existence of a single mechanism for making all the nuclei in nature. however, when only production by rapid neutron capture is considered, it is easy to understand the apparent universalities in the yield patterns when only producing radioactive ni and mg is considered. if there is an adequate neutron source directly or indirectly related to the neutrino - driven wind from all neutron stars by some unknown mechanism, then all the solar systems could share the same neutron density and present the same environment as the dark matter. furthermore, we show that the data are consistent with a self - similar, neutron star made by any of the various types of astrophysical sources explored. the heavy element synthesis models presented here can not only account for the data but also reproduce the overall solar abundance pattern without any single process. it is possible to reproduce the light fhf by producing nuclei from progenitors that have the right mass fractions and neutron densities but require a very high neutron density in order to do so. this is in contrast to the strict requirements of the strict nuclear and physical conditions in the universe that have been imposed on neutron star mergers and neutron star formation. * keywords : * nucleosynthesis ; solar system : abundances stars : neutron star physics
the willmore energy of an immersed compact oriented surface with boundary in @xmath0 is the total energy of the curve of compact embedded objects with boundary constraints. the simpler area functional is the result of a linear combination of conformal invariance with respect to the full mbius group and a constraint - free conormal field. the more complicated area functional turns out to be the subject of an infinite series of papers by sullivan ( *??? * pb 1.11 ) and grady ( a.k.a., willmore boundary problem ). here, we develop a linear formulation of the problem of minimizing discrete representations of any functional of the form @xcite. the linear formulation that we propose is based on two key ideas. first, we use the concept of surface continuation constraints. using this, we find a discrete definition of discrete mean curvature that is vertex - based and a discrete flow that can be obtained from that definition. based on this definition, we derive a time discrete approximation of the willmore flow. the two step process of approximating the flow is then performed on the discrete solution of the linearization problem. we discuss whether classical strategies for linear optimization can be used. we present a first possible approach yielding a quadratic energy. we also discuss whether the problem can be tackled by classical linear optimization techniques. the equivalence between finding minimal surfaces and solving a flow problem holds true for discrete surfaces defined as a connected set of cell faces in a cellular complex discrete representation of the space. we will consider polyhedra that are union of triangles with vertices in ( a finite subset of ) the cubic lattice. when a discrete solution is seeked among such surfaces, i.e., when a surface has two regular surfaces, it is proved that the minimization of the program is equivalent to solving a minimum - cost circulation network flow problem, for which efficient codes have been developed by boykov and kolmogorov ( after ford and fulkerson ). the paper discusses possible strategies to tackle the latter problem.
in this paper, we propose a _ learning - based _ cognitive beamforming ( cb ) transmit strategy for _ cognitive radio ( cr ) _ ( for short ), where the channel information of the channel that the cr transmits to pr is used is extracted at the pr terminals via periodically observing the pr transmissions. the proposed cb scheme does not require any prior knowledge of the pr transmit beamforming matrices. instead, by exploiting the time - division duplex ( tdd ) operation mode of the cr and pr terminals, it requires only the observed effective interference channel ( eic ) over which the cr is able to transmit with pr at the same time and frequency over the detected available spatial dimensions. in addition, the proposed scheme exploits additional side information on the pr transmission that can be extractable from the observed eic. for this purpose, we present two different algorithms for estimating the eic, under different assumptions on the availability of the information power knowledge at the cr terminal. moreover, for the ideal case when the cr transmit power is _ perfect _ and noiseless, we derive the optimal time allocation for the cb to maximize the effective throughput of the coupled cor channel - to - pr. to compensate for the interference caused by the cr s interference due to its own transmit power constraint and the interference power constraints, we apply the convex optimization techniques for the underlay method, which has been successfully used for underlay methods for practical cr systems. simulations to show the resulting cb design feasibility, we first consider the case where the cr transmission is equipped with multi - antennas and is using the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) transmit power control ( mcmc ), and then choose the appropriate time allocation among the multiple pr and cr transmit channels to implement the proposed strategy. we show that the resulting interference can be controlled properly by the total pr transmit power, bit rate, bandwidth, and antenna beam, in terms of the calculated effective channel, and find the optimal performance at the expense of the ml. in this case, we prove that the existing underweave and interweave methods can not achieve the same effective throughput tradeoff for the cr link, under perfect channel estimation. by studying the tradeoff, we also propose a new design for the combined cb, namely _ opportunistic spatial sharing _ ( oss ), by allowing the cr to transmit concurrently with prs via the equivalent channel, @xmath0, when the signal power levels at all pr receivers are kept below some predefined threshold, also
we develop a first - principles canonical quantization formalism for the study of the interaction between a quantum scalar field and dissipative material polarizable bodies. these are locally modeled as complex quantum systems in each point of space, formed by quantum harmonic oscillators describing the volume elements of the polarizable body which are coupled to its own thermal bathm. before the initial time @xmath0, all the parts of the total system ( field and materials ) are not interacting. here, the macroscopic em properties of the material result from tracing out the internal dynamics of the degrees of freedom and thermal baths during the interaction with the quantum field. in this way, the steady situation is deduced and the fluctuation - dissipation relation results naturally from the open quantum system framework. we obtain expressions for the long - time contributions to the field operator, each one associated to a specific part of the _ total _ system. one of them is associated to the volume element, another one is connected to the baths and, finally, there is a contribution entirely relatedto the field initial conditions. for arbitrary time, we obtain a specific solution for the energy - momentum tensor that matches in a hilbert space with its homogeneous solutions considered in previous works. taking into account the initial conditions, we clearly describe all the features of the quantum fluctuations between time - average and vanishing fqed configurations. this allows us to analytically determine the casimir force both for thermal and squeezed initial states of the field and each slabs has its own temperature. in thermal equilibrium, we find that at a given time only two contributions contribute to the steady state. moreover, we show that the approach of taking the form of the closed time path or schwinger - keldysh functional is applicable to the non - equilibrium situations. our results clearly call for the full consideration of quantum fluctuations and the full treatment of dissipation.
nonlinear optical properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a - si : h ) in the telecom band have been the focus of significant research activity in the field of strongly correlated nonlinear optics. the strong dependence of nonlinear properties on details of material growth, growth, and switching operations, as well as manufacturing processes, has motivated a large number of recent studies on the subject. in this paper, we report on switching experiments in a 10-@xmath0 m - diameter microring resonator based on a single- and multi - pass dielectric gradient - enhanced vapor deposition ( pecvd ) process, in which the nonlinear refractive index of the resonator is set to a value near @xmath1 through a process we refer to as _ cross - phase modulation_. we use pump probe spectroscopy to characterize free - carrier - induced blueshifts of the cavity resonance, which we demonstrate to have a significant impact on switching times. we demonstrate switching times of up to 14.8 ps using a pump probe train. 10 a. k. ekert, ` ` block - iterative frequency - domain theory of optical switching in nanoscale systems, '' ieee photon.. lett. * 8 *, 401, ( 19#3 ) ( 2010 ). c. j. moore, t. c. rakher, l. hollberg, j. e. bjorkholm, and i. l. chuang, _ computational electrodynamics : the next generation photonics _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, england, 2000 ). p. g. kwiat, k. mattle, h. weier, vahlbruch, m. mehmet, r. randolsky, c. ellerbroek, s. franke - arnold, loh and t. w. hnsch, _ introduction to optical switch devices based on hydrogenated silicon _ ( plenum press, 1999 ). m. aspelmeyer, d. bouwmeester, k.- h. brouri, chen, v. m. mulvey, and j. p. marangos ` ` demonstration of second - order nonlinear optical effects in water - bonded carbon nanotubes and photovoltaic solar cells, '' j. opt. soc. am. b * 21 *, 308 ( 2005 ). s. quabis, p. mey
we describe and analyze the measurement of the peculiar velocities of @xmath0 galaxies in the local universe with respect to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with the aim of mapping the mass distribution out to distances of 10,000 or more. the first paper in this series ( tonry 1997 ) described the method and presented results from a new calibration of the method. here we present analyses of a sample of 362 early - type galaxies with distances from the sinusoidal survey of nearby elliptical and spiral galaxies, and of cepheid distances to nearby spiral galaxies. we demonstrate that the sbf technique is a powerful tool for mapping the local and large - scale velocity field through accurate distance measurements of early - types. we adopt here an empirically calibrated, parametric model for the velocity field of galaxies centered on the milky way and use the data to construct parametric models for the distribution of dark and luminous matter. we find that the two - point correlation length of the galaxy distribution within the local group is well described by the ` ` forward '' tully - fisher relation and, for the large majority of galaxies, converges to unity at large distances. we show that the convergent flows into the local supercluster and great attractor dominate the departures from pure hubble flow for most of our sample. however, we find large, but not always consistent, bulk flows over even larger volumes of space. in particular, several of our data are unique in that they handle large anisotropy of the cmb, even at distances well below the scale of the virgo and shapley superclusters. as a result, we are able to use them to explore the covariances between various model parameters, such as the attractor distances and amplitudes, the hubble parameter, and the overall bulk flow. in addition, we demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to malmquist bias, the effect of a weak gravitational field from intervening intervening dark matter, and to the possible presence of intervening large voids and other possible attractors.
we provide a systematic analysis of the physics of interacting impurities in randomly doped spin-1/2 ladders using both analytical and numerical arguments. in particular, we focus on the antiferromagnetic ( af ) case and discuss the following issues : ( i ) the effective interaction between impurities for commensurate and incommensurate backgrounds ; ( ii ) the emergence of large spins due to random signs in effective couplings in a realistic context including finite size effects due to chain breaking ; ( iii ) the temperature scaling of the curie constant of the uniform susceptibility, as obtained from both effective and realistic doped ladder models ; ( iv ) the deviations of the magnetic curve from the brillouin response as a probe of the magnitude of interactions. regarding the latter, we show that the spin-@xmath0 operator acting at one of the two sites of a two leg ladder is expected to break short - range resonating valence bond type physics, resulting in a quasi - free spin-2 spin-3/2 electron, strongly localized in the vicinity of the impurity, even when the underlying spin system is frustrated. such a short range effect is believed to be robust in the case of true three - dimensional ordering mechanism in such weakly coupled chains or ladder materials. nevertheless, we also show that a saturation of moments below a certain energy, below which free local moments are expected, occurs in some cases. indeed, a clear separation between different energy scales is expected, in particular between the energy scales below which magnetic excitations are expected and the energy at which they are synthesized. the separation remains plausible in the strong - coupling limit, although we have not investigated the limit of strong coupling. in this point, a new bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) phase occurs, with the interesting possibility to induce new physics as compared to the disorder - free situation. other impurity - induced phenomena, such as magnetization turnoff and specific heat, may also be observed at very low temperature.
the methods to change from global to local minimizers have been extensively applied to different problems in physics and engineering. however, in many cases the global transformation is not sufficient to completely characterize the 3d structures under study. in this article we briefly review the successful application of the shrink - wrap and sir algorithms to the problem of ab - initio solution of a 3d structure with local minima. these algorithms have been proven to be succesfull in many circumstances applied in a variety of ways. to summarize recent results, our analysis makes some comments on the numerical results obtained by fienup and speden, on the one hand, and on the other hand. [ [ section ] ] during the early thirties, there were several interesting ways to transform an image @xcite. apart from charge flipping, there have been various attempts to introduce atomicity constraint to reduce the amout of information in an image ( solvent flipping, for instance ). what distinguishes the most successful of these is that they somehow manage to somehow move from very low to high spatial resolution without losing any useful information ( for example by slowly increasing the gray levels ) on the way there. one possible explanation could be that the set based on low resolution is more smooth, or the number of possible phases of its fourier transform could improve convergence by gradually introducing more degrees of freedom in the resulting image. despite this, in practice the algorithms usually do not reach the optimal local solution, although a set defined by quantized levels is also not - convex. this work will discuss this phenomenon analytically. the previous definitions of the algorithms still apply just to the local minimizer version of hio ( hio ) without bounching on the axis. alternately the hio+er algorithm bouncing between the regions closer to the two circles would have worked in all the examples shown above. also hio with the correct intervals would have also converged to the solution for larger intervals between er iterations. the latter is a good ( single parameter ) way to change to global minimizer, although it seems better to start from a high value of @xmath0 and decrease it afterwards. difference map, a conjugate gradient based method, reaches a local minimum with quadradic convergence, and provides such kind of information. the solvent flipping algorithm does not show much success.
we consider two search tasks asking us to find formulas with certain properties for a boolean function @xmath0 and, in particular, a proof of a falsifiable tautology@xmath1, all in polynomial time. we are motivated by the fact that in the nisan - wigderson hardness conjecture @xcite that every proveable proof system for a function of a class of proofs is a cook - reckhow proof system. we prove that this conjecture holds and we show that for a large class of search tasks it is indeed possible to construct hard tautologies, namely, hard proof systems, based on a large number of extra axioms. as an application we construct so called _ recipes _, also called _ proof systems with advice_. the first part of this paper is devoted to proving the existence of optimal proof systems and to showing that some of them are hard to construct. the second part involves showing that useful notions of lower bounds for good proof systems ( and in particular for decent proof systems ) are useful also in contexts where one can not necessarily construct these kinds of proof systems. proof systems are mathematical combinatorial structures designed to perform specific and computationally efficient tasks. they exist and we shall study them in section [ search task ]. the idea of proof complexity has been one of the driving forces in the development of complexity theory in the first half of the 20th century. proof complexity introduced in the area of mathematical physics was indeed a key tool in the early investigations of the need for analysis and reduction of linear and nonlinear effects in proofs in the theory. proofs in complexity theory reduce the problem of finding good theory to one of a wide range of problems ; the most prominent example being the search task of finding a suitable algorithm to find a truth proof of some formula. a proof system is a set of formulas, or string, satisfying a couple of conditions, such that the output of the proof is ` ` satisfied '' or ` ` compatible '' with the lower bound on the size of the string the proof system can achieve. it is the simplest and most natural definition of proof as follows : proof is proved by a u(1 ) diagram showing the largest possible number of proofs for the given constant, i.e. proving a lower bound for the universal ( as opposed to different definitions of proof, see section [ basic definitions ] ). although it is easy to see that the above definition is the result of an application of an idea first introduced by razborov in his work about the so
i present an update of a review i gave at iau symposium 191 ( groenewegen 1999 ) of the properties of carbon stars in external galaxies. i use this review when i use it to refer to new results published since then, and i make a comparison of the new results with the old ones. in this paper i mainly discuss the ( recent ) results that have been found in terms of the colour - magnitude diagram for carbon stars. this diagram was designed to highlight the differences between carbon stars of different spectral types. in contrast to previous diagrams, i use the colour-colour diagram with two broad - band filters to select m - stars ( usually chosen to correspond to m0 and later ) instead of c - stars. the results are as follows. ( 1 ) the most luminous carbon stars are redder ( @xmath0 ) than the least luminous oxygen - rich stars. ( 2 ) the correlation between absolute visual magnitude and metallicity is still present, though there are now several new results that confirm this trend ( e.g. blumoff et al. 2001, and conroy & whitelam 2002 ). ( 3 ) the surface density ( c- to late m - star ratio ) is constant, suggesting that there is no significant population of hotter carbon stars out of the m - and s - stars for which the distribution of these two types of star is equal. ( 4 ) all 4 known carbon stars for ngc 2403 ( and possibly all 5 known r - stars as well ) have luminosities that are much higher than the average for galaxies with known luminosity functions. ( 5 ) the bolometric luminosity function ( lf ) of a carbon star is significantly fainter than that of an oxygen - star, possibly because the carbon stars have smaller thermal pulses. ( 6 ) about 40 % of the stars in this sample are classified as being of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) type. ( 7 ) while there are about 100 agb stars with m - type spectra, few of them are actually luminous enough to be classified as a genuine agb star. ( 8 ) i cross - match 2mass with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to find a list of 161 r - star candidates, with an rms of about 0.42 arcsecmin. the lists of these matches are presented in table 3. in the sub - sample of 152 carbon stars, i find 41 c-, 7 s-
the nucleus of the local group galaxy m31 ( * m31 * ) is an unresolved point source at the galactic center. recent _ chandra _ observations suggest that this source is a ten - times more massive than the black hole at the center of the galactic disk. and because its luminosity is variable on a time scale of a year, it may be a member of the dense cluster of tenuous clusters of massive accreting black holes. we explore the temperature and density profiles of the hot and cold branch solutions near the nucleus of m31, taking into account the latest high - precision mm, sub - mm and x - ray measurements. in both cases, the initial temperature near @xmath0 falls within the unstable region of the cooling function. as the gas cools, it transitions from optically thick to optically thin emission, perhaps from stellar winds, and begins toircle toward the central object. we find that the best - fit model for the accretion onto the nucleus is one in which a thin plume of hot gas rises through the disk, reaches a stable orbit, and is accreted at a rate that exceeds the rate of the central black hole. at large radii, its spectrum is dominated by bremsstrahlung and compton scattering, possibly due to the inverse compton cooling processes, but with a non - negligible contribution from soft x - rays, some of which may be produced by recombination in the hot outer regions. in contrast, the plasma from sgr a *, which lies a few pc to the east of the nucleus, has a considerably harder spectrum, is relatively easily understood in the context of the thin - branch solution, but is easily distinguished from other possible solutions by having a relatively high temperature and low density. the relative contributions of these two systems to the global cooling flow in the galaxy center are therefore likely to be highly correlated. we discuss the implications of these results for the next generation of coordinated observations of the nuclear accretion disk around m31.

we present the analysis of two angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( pnr ) curves of the ybco / lcmo superlattice at 100oe and 4koe, together with the shape of the perpendicular to these curves, x - ray reflectivity curves of xmcd and xrmr. the reflection curves clearly reveal the presence of ferromagnetic cu nanoribbon layers as well as the off - specular scattering features caused by cu ion antiparallel to the mn ions. we propose a simple block - like geometrical model that reproduces the main features of the measurement results. the magnetic moments as a function of the temperature and field have been calculated in the energy region below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0k and we show that the resulting values agree well with the measured ones. however, large discrepancies exist between the models. we explain the observed deviation from the measured values by the inverse magnetic proximity effect in terms of the dephasing time scale, where the fermi motion is predicted to produce a strong decrease in the magnetic moment compared to the nuclear one. in addition, we argue that the observed increase of the even order slbp intensity around the 1st bragg peak, which is anti - correlated with the decrease of the cu moment, can not be accounted for by our models. finally, as a contribution to the study of the magnetic properties of the sl, we suggest that the observations of the 2nd and 4th order slbps, which are associated with the transition from the heavy fermion ( fm ) state to the normal state, can be related to the calculated magnetic thickness of the depleted fm layers close to the sl interfaces, i.e. to the positions of the measured bragg peaks. studying the evolution of the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the sl of manganates is one of the most active areas of research at present and is a crucial step to be undertaken both in exploring the novel physics of the low dimensional many - body system and to understand the experimental signatures of the unconventional state of matter. + the manganate superconductors provide a platform on which to explore the physics of several important issues of contemporary condensed matter physics, such as the origin of the large scale mott - hubbard model and the effects of an unwanted contamination of the electronic phases by impurities and magnetic impurities. in a recent series of papers @xcite it has been argued that the man
based on a detailed analysis of the rest - frame nuv spectrum of lbds 53w069 ( @xmath0 ), we have performed a preliminary comparison between the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the reddest known high redshift galaxies and those predicted by three independent population synthesis models. the difference in signal - to - noise ratio for these two galaxies is well consistent with the broad - band sed produced by each individual star. hence, a comparison of these two seds is a powerful way to set constraints on the ages of old stellar populations at high redshifts. however, in this paper we show that the combined effect of age and metallicity results in large error bars which are shown to be independent of the population synthesis model used. this problem persists even if we use the spectral energy distributions over a wide range of wavelengths instead of a set of broadband filters. only at snr@xmath1 10 can the data disentangle the degeneracy. further, it is found that if one assumes that a given star in a galaxy at the present epoch and at some point in its past has an age of about 4 gyr, then the best age estimates based on fitting of the observed seds are not high enough to yield appreciable precision. the calibration of the seds and the use of synthetic seds built from ssps do not appear to suffer from the same issue. in fact, we find that fitting of synthetic models to the observed sed allows to find age values which are in excellent agreement with the corresponding age estimates for the galaxies. the discrepancy between these two age estimates can be translated into a formation redshift. after correcting for the calibration, one can still get a good estimate for the age of the universe in the range of 4 - 7 gyr depending on the model adopted. finally, a careful examination of the photometric errors in these analyses shows that a full photometric calibration over the whole stellar population range could pose a strong constraint on the cosmological parameters.

we present a laser - illuminated detection and ranging technique that uses a single - pixel single - photon avalanche diode as a tracking device to precisely locate and locate hidden objects outside of the direct line of sight. our system uses close to @xmath0 coupling of light onto a sensitive pixel - area that is up to 60 times larger than current available in visible@xmath1near - infrared wavelength point - spread function cameras. in a first experiment, we demonstrate that we can accurately locate a person standing around the righthand - side corner of a t - junction and determine their position with an uncertainty that is less than 50 m. simulations of the experiment show that this technique is sufficient to detect objects with large distances, such as people moving in a hidden environment, with an accuracy of 1 m and a location accuracy above 50 m. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 a. tnnermann, t. schreiber, f. rser, a. liem, s. hfer, m. mehmet, h. zellmer, l. nolte, and h. rubinsztein - dunlop, ` ` imaging small objects with extraordinary accuracy in the face of a wall, '' phys. rev. lett. * 98 *, 013601 ( 2009 ). j. p. marangos, d. a. cluzel, n. n. newman, and e. s. w. tate,``complex imaging with high spatial resolution and high accuracy in remote sensing, '' opt. express * 20 *, 8188 ( 2013 ). p. j. gariepy, b. carrion, j. m. choma, c. de clerciaud, k. dimopoulos, and p. c. haquez - dada, `� observation of a person guiding a laser beam towards a hidden person, '' science * 312 *, 246255 ( 2011 ). d. g. gollin, t.- b. williams, p. r. dasgupta, j.- a. denninghoff, s.- j. ramrez, and r. salath,``anti - viral detection and recovery of petersen locations based on polarization coincidence, '' j. opt. soc. am. b * 21 *, 18891894 ( 2007 ). g. grosche, a.- m.- y. lin,
we present a new kinematical variable that gives, under certain circumstances, the cm angular distribution of a decaying particle @xmath0 and a neutrino, i.e., the difference between the spin - combinations of the mother - particle and the daughter - particle. we apply this variable to d - y asymmetric channel production of a charged lepton ( an electron or a muon ) coupled to a muonic oscillator, in order to measure the parity violation of the couplings. its parity - violating features are, however, not apparent in the usual markov chain monte carlo analyses. we show that our reconstructed kinematics exactly agrees with the one derived from the true cmb angular distribution, in particular, the sign of the variable is unambiguously determined event by event. we find that the spin combination of the small and large solutions can be consistently split into two types of solutions. the large solution gives the negative absolute value of the distribution of the relative momentum of the two particles. while the small solution s sign depends on the relative energy of the measured particle, whose momentum is transverse to the momentum of its daughter particle, the magnitude of the observed particle s momentum is unknown. using this sign, we numerically calculate the following cm angular distributions : i ) flat " distributions, ii ) parabolic distributions, iii ) negative concavity distributions, iv ) m " shaped distributions, and v ) flat distributions. despite the fact that the shape of the distributions is determined by the collision energy, all of them contain the information necessary to reconstruct the cmb structure. however, the curvature of these distributions is in principle controllable at the ilc. it is found that the spherical distributions always give rise to the possibility of parity violation, at least in some cases, although there is always a two - fold ambiguity in the cm frame. the results presented here could be applied to the drell - yan process, where the multiple visible particles come from an intermediate state that could also decay to a single visible particle decaying to jets. in this case, the spin and the parity of the daughter particle could be reconstructed, although the uncertainty in the measured mass of the additional intermediate state might still be significant. kek - th-1597 - 009 + ific-97 - 40 + hep - ph/9702018 * andrzej j.c. wiedner@xmath1 * + _ and _ * z.f. physik - department, technische
we investigate the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple population globular clusters using a series of high - resolution n - body simulations. we focus on the properties of the second - generation ( sg ) population and its spatial mixing with the first generation of stars ( fg ). the simulations cover four different initial conditions characterized by different degrees of the initial concentration of the sg subsystem. starting with a fg cluster of mass @xmath0, we follow the evolution of the cluster s constituent stars through the early loss of fg stars and the formation of a sg population. the evolution is driven by two - body relaxation with the number of sg stars initially concentrated in the cluster core. as the cluster expands, the local relaxation time increases and the rate of its dynamical aging increasingly slows down. a significant slowdown in the evolution toward complete mixing ensues. our simulations show that relaxation - driven mass loss affects the mixing process by slowing and eventually restoring the cluster relaxation time, causing the loss of its outer mixed layers. by comparing the initial structure of the clusters with the same initial sg number distribution but different mass - loss rates, we quantitatively identify the joint role of relaxation and tidal mass loss in the spatial mixing process. for the systems studied here, the radial dependence of the number ratio of sgs to fg is likely not to be much different from that observed in the galactic stellar halo, unless a significant fraction of the fg population has lost most of its mass in an early phase. however, the measured radial dependence is strongly suggestive of the possible presence of a very large population of very he - rich stars in some clusters. we discuss possible observational signatures of this multiple population nature and we emphasize that our results do not yet fully account for the likely simultaneous addition of he - enriched and he - poor stars to the galactic halo.
we study the spectral instability of non - self - adjoint semiclassical differential operators, introduced by m. hager, subject to random perturbations. in particular, we study the spectrum of such operators close to the boundary of the pseudospectrum. we shall state an @xmath0-asymptotic formula for the average density of eigenvalues of the perturbed operator. starting from a weyl estimate of the norm of the resolvent of the unperturbed operator, we will show that the spectrum can be highly unstable even for very small perturbants. as a consequence, the eigenvalue distribution properties of these operators are highly sensitive to the coupling constant. outside of a narrow region of the weyl band the spectrum exhibits exponential decay, while inside of this band it decays double exponentially. in order to understand the origin of this behavior we treat the needed grushin problems for the operator. we derive a description of the semi - algebraic case for the whole of the banach space. in this case, the spectrum is highly structured and contains many non - gaussian random polynomials. we show that their average density is a strong function of the weak coupling constant and we state a conjecture on their distribution. _ key words and phrases : _ hager s equation, weyl asymptotics, random gaussian quantization, randomness. _ msc ( 2010 ) : _ 13p20, 14j05, 14m20, 13m55, 34c25. _ \label{eq:#1 } \equation ( [ eq:#1 ] ) \end{picture}1}-1. \in { \ensuremathsievensphere{-1}\,\end{aligned}\ ] ] # 1#2(max_1 ), # 1,#2,#3,_#1 _ * # 2 * ( # 3 ) \put(m_z)^(^2,^p)_z,\label{z}_z^1}_ # 1(#2 ), \label { \raisebox{-2 } \, { \rm h}\rightarrow z\sim h. theweyl ( weyl ) equation can be used to study spectral instability for non - normal operators. for example, if we consider an operator defined by a u(1,1 ) complex valued independent z@xmath1 with complex gaussian weyl expectation value @x
the opacity of a 24-element solar mixture along a thermodynamic path is calculated at solar interior conditions obtained from is and ic calculations. we use a maximum entropy method to calculate the rosseland mean free path and an opacity variation profile which assimilates the missing opacity required by helioseismology and neutrino observations. we identify ion - ion correlations as a source of uncertainty in the calculation of solar opacities. the effect of such correlations is studied by using a fully relativistic quantum mechanical theory that includes self - consistent treatment of ionic structure. we find a significant @xmath0 increase in the co - moving opacity of the solar mixture within the sound speed profile and the convection radius which can not be explained by the ion - correlation effect. in addition, we find that the increase of the opacity is dependent on the type of surfactant foam and also on the total amount of doping. we propose an experiment in which theano - solar - composition and doping densities can be used to determine the true extent of the increase. an experimental validation of solar opacity calculations at stellar interior conditions, which has never been performed in the past, can aid in understanding the source of the unidentified opacity. the required foam densities approach the maximal available density, thus a monochromatic experiment should be able to solve the age age problem with solar models. + * keywords : * opacity ; solar mixture ; solar opacity ; plastic foams ; mesoscopic x - ray spectrometers * # 1#1@xmath1 # 1 # 1;#2;#3;#4;#5 # 1, # 3 * # 4 *, # 5 ( # 2 ) desy 10 - 043issn 0418 - 9833 + september 2010 + * rojpan - vch : osservatorio astronomico di roma ` ` ` star '', i.e., universit degli studi di milano - bicocca, + p.le aldo moro 5, i-20133 milano, italy + e - mail : star@astroscu.it _ _ subject headings : _ planetary systems ; atmospheric effects ; cosmology : theory ; particle physics.
we investigate edge state transport in a two - dimensional scanning gate microscope ( sgm ) device in the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) regime. the goal of the experiment is to determine the role of pre - existing scattering sites on the edge of the device and test whether they perturb the edge state conductance. we identify and control well - localized scattering sites responsible for the suppressed edge conductance in the qsh regime by scanning gate microscopy measurements. a back - gate electrode is used to tune the edge states in the device to produce peaks in the conductance with voltages intermediate between the valence band and the conduction band. the data obtained using the sgm results provide evidence for the presence of previously unperturbed scattering sites at the edge, as previously noted by zhang _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. b, * 77 *, 2733 ( 2000 ) ]. additionally, we demonstrate that the backscattering can be enhanced resonantly by the tip - induced potential perturbation near the device edge, leading to the formation of a small set of sharp arcs of suppressed conductance separated by a scattering site. for positive tip voltages, these arcs are localized in the bulk and appear to form a barrier between the quantum well structure and the observed flux levels, supporting the interpretation that the scattering sites along the edge are part of a system with strong potential disorder, and not a chance alignment of the tip to the well. the devices with similar properties as our own, namely high-@xmath0 irreducible bulk carriers and a domain, but with a smaller mesa and a different geometrical arrangement of elements, show a clear separation between the two scattering sites. the smallness of the gap in our device relative to the bulk leads to the prediction of a 1.5 to 2.2-molecule size limit of @xmath1. combining our measurements with earlier measurements of the same material, we find a 20 % reduction in the mean conductance for _ mixed _ bulk and mixed - bulk edge states, in comparison to the previously reported qsh picture. 10 h. j. metcalf and p. van der straten, ` ` theory of quantum transport in nanotubes, '' nature * 424 *, 359363 ( 2009 ). j. a. schuller, e. s. barnard, m. lukin, s. chattopadhyay, k. d. jones, and r. l. by
we study the evolution of the vertical distribution of young galactic - disk objects with accurately determined ages - open star clusters. our sample consists of 203 young open clusters located within a 0.15 - 1 kpc distance interval from the galactic center ( @xmath0 = 7.5 kpc ) and having ages in the range 0.3 @xcite. we find a strong positive correlation ( with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 ) between the initial vertical coordinates of newly - born clusters and their initial vertical velocity components ( i.e., the components with respect to the vertical axis are the same in all respects ). to eliminate possible convective overshooting, we analyzed the cluster ages as a function of age computed in terms of two evolutionary grids : one is based on the period of vertical oscillations of stars and the other on the value of the local mass density of visible matter. under the assumption that the observed local ( dynamic ) mass density is the same for all stars at a given galactocentric distance, we find that the following properties are inconsistent with the estimates based on recent analyses of stellar kinematics and the assumption of a homogeneous vertical mass density in the solar neighborhood : ( i ) the local density of dark mass ( corresponding to the ratio of the mean initial vertical velocities and the vertical direction of new stars ) can not exceed a value which is much higher ( by more than an order of magnitude ) than the value inferred from the recent power - spectrum analysis of the galactic disk. ( ii ) this value is incompatible with the value ( value of ) the present - day sunyaev - zeldovich scaling relation that has been adopted for the constancy of stellar evolution. ( iii ) most of the produced stars remain gravitationally bound and are coeval to the disk, independently of their distances from the sun. therefore, by comparing the ages and the timescales of young clusters with the ages computed in the corresponding evolutionary grids we can discriminate between different models which, naturally, yield different individual cluster ages and, consequently, different periods of vertical ( elliptical ) oscillations.

in this paper, we present resolved stellar, h@xmath0, and galex photometry, from different data archives, and wht - isis optical spectroscopy of the five brightest star - forming knots of the nearest bcd galaxy ngc 6789, in order to study their star formation history ( sfh ) and metallicity. the latter is derived by fitting the optical spectrum with stellar populations synthesis models, one of the most reliable methods. thanks to the long - slit geometry of this galaxy, the electron temperature of the ionised gas was determined taking into account the measurement errors. we derived oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neon, and argon total abundances in all the studied knots by taking the ionic abundances calculated in our tailored photoionisation models. the derived densities for [ sii ] and [ oii ] are very similar for the first four knots, being lower than 100 @xmath1. t([oii ] ) was measured in three of the knots ( b, c, and e ) and it was estimated in the other two knots by means of relations between these temperatures and the measured value of [ oiii ]. the abundances of nitrogen and oxygen, however, are systematically higher in the four lowest knots ( log(n / o ) = -1.38 ) than in the others. in the case of knot c, this ratio is even higher, with a value of +1.07. the cause of these discrepancies can be partially found in the corresponding icfs as the total nitrogen abundances derived from the assumption n / o on the other hand, are consistent with the values derived in the literature. the possible origin of the nitrogen overabundance in the five knots is discussed. in general, these results do not support a scenario of triggered star formation in the central region of the galaxy, which has been the main scenario in previous studies of metal - poor gas in blue compact dwarf galaxies.
the nucleus of the giant radio source ngc 6251 *, at a distance of 106 mpc, is a prototype of the class of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei for which reasonably secure black hole masses have been determined using dynamical measurements. more recent _ hubble space telescope _ optical and radio observations suggest that the strong radio emission from its most compact region may be due to synchrotron emission by a very hot plasma ( in excess of @xmath0 k ). we propose that the radio spectrum of this galaxy s core is dominated by the optically thick emission from the hot plasma, which is a likely component of the bondi - hoyle captured gas that flows inward to merge with the accretion disk. we scrutinize the results of multi - wavelength studies of this system, which include observations at cm, mm, and sub - parsec scales. the inferred black hole mass is much smaller than that inferred for sgr a *, but the inferred accretion rate is similar, suggesting that the massive accreting black hole can easily be energized by self - comptonization of unirradiated uv - bright plasma emission, as required by various accretion models. the implied mass loss rate is a small fraction of the total power produced by the central engine, if the plasma remains cold all the way to the event horizon. we show that x - ray emission from a compact region around the black hole is consistent with the extended radio emission inferred from asca observations, but that the unresolved uv emission at cm and mm wavelengths can not be reconciled with the inferred from the uv spectrum. we conclude that any energy flux advected through the disk in the radio jet formed by the inflaton processes must be small, and that it must be fed almost entirely from the ambient ionized medium. = -0.5 cm = cmr10 = cmti10 = cmbx10 scaled1 = cmn10 at 10pt
we demonstrate the diffraction controlled generation of dynamic laguerre - gauss ( lg ) lattices. by exciting two pairs of lg beams with frequencies separated by a few mhz, we demonstrate the rotational generation of dark lattices with an intensity pattern rotating at an angular frequency of one or two @xmath0s of mhz. furthermore, by subjecting cold atoms to the dark or bright lattice, they can be trapped in the resulting light potential. in order to show the experimental feasibility of the scheme, we consider a setup combining an optical lattice with a quadrupole magnetic trap. interactions between light waves in a lattice are important for many areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, atomic physics and cosmology. the interaction between a light beam and an atomic lattice has fundamental and practical importance, in particular in the development of spintronic devices and optomechanics. the behaviour of light in lattices of different intensities has been investigated extensively @xcite and various theoretical models have been developed. by creating a diffraction dominated lg beam and passing light through a two - level dipole potential, it is possible to generate a bright lg lattice and a dark lattice simultaneously. this is possible not only for individual atoms, but also for large ensembles of light and dark particles, leading to the possibility of a hybrid lattice structure. a particularly interesting case is that of ultracold atoms, which can be confined in a ring lattice by an appropriate laser potential and then recombine to form a bright elliptical lattice. in this case the phase difference between the two light beams is practically zero and the intensity pattern can be rotationally propagating through the lattice at a rate that is comparable to the spin of a few 1000 particles a year. more recently, vortices have been proposed as an alternative alternative to lattices and have been demonstrated experimentally with atoms in a double - well dipole trap @xcit. the use of lattices has been suggested to play a major role in future cooling of atoms, and it has been shown that diffraction - controlled heating of an atomic crystal can also be employed for the creation of optical lattices @xcited. a further route to a quantum lattice is to to create an entanglement between two opposite light beams, which then rub against each other at the potential. for the latter case, the phase of the incident light beam is determined by the intensity gradient of the first order laser beam, and the
we test the validity of the stokes - einstein ( se ) relation and the decoupling of translational and rotational motion in the spc / e model of water. by performing molecular dynamics simulations, we find that at low temperatures there is a breakdown of both the se and sed relations and these relations can be replaced by fractional functional forms. the se breakdown is observed in every scale of rotational mobility. similarly, the sed breakdown is produced by a generalized breakdown, instead of a view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown. we also find that, upon cooling, the liquid does not become a glass in a spatially homogeneous fashion. finally, we include the effect of time scale in the study. = 1.5truecm = -0.3truecm 1truecm * c - v. diff. nucl. * b#1 *, # 3 ( # 2 ) # 1#2#3#4#5#6c. r. # 1 # 2 - # 3 - # 4#1#2 # 3 # 4 # 5#1| # # 1| # 1*#1 # 1 - # 1(#2,#3)_adv. chem. _ * # 1 * # 2 ( # 3 ) [ apj ] # 1,#2 ] apj. phys. lett. # 1 ( 19#3 ) [ m]#1 hep - th/9911158 + ens/99/17 + june 1999 + * breakdowns of stokes and einstein relations in molecular systems * + chung - lin shan + _ department of chemistry, national cheng kung university _ + no. 1, university road, tainan city 70101, taiwan, r.o.c. _ + e - mail : clshan@mail.ncku.edu.tw + @xmath0 center for emergent matter science, department of physics, tsing hua university, beijing 100084, china + electronic - chemistry department, national center for theoretical sciences, hsinchu city 30013, chia
the core - collapse supernova remnant casa has been monitored with the _ integral _ satellite. two cycles of observations have been performed, with a total exposure of 3 ms. assuming that the @xmath0-ray emission is due to explosive nucleosynthesis, one of the main observational goals is to measure the flux of the 67.9 kev, 78.4 kev and 1157 kev lines. since these lines arise from only a small fraction of the total mass of the remnant, a very careful analysis should take into account the contamination of known sources by sub - chandrasekhar white dwarfs. indeed, recent _ comptel _ observations of sn 1987a signal the presence of hard x - ray sources in the field of casa. however, even if these sources were included in the analysis, we still do not require the strong line emission seen from casa in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the explosion velocity. recent _ bepposax_-pds observations of radioactive elements in supernovae add another piece to the puzzle of the origin of their heavy isotopes. the most - abundant radioactive element is the most abundant iron isotope, but in the new regime it is produced in the bow shock directly from the ejecta, instead of being synthesized in the core. moreover, the kinetic energy of the long - lived radioactive element@xmath3tiis a tracer of recent supernova activity. this has been especially important for casa, as it is the only source of reliable line fluxes from young known, and still to be discovered supernova remnants. the main goal of the observations has been to use a power - law continuum to study the kinematics of the fe - rich ejecta. this is motivated by the recent evidence that the expanding ejecta in casa may be asymmetric, and also by the discovery of a jet / counter jet system in the supernova reprocessing cell.
we present _ spitzer space telescope _ infrared spectrograph observations of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the lmc and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ). we aim at measuring the current rate of gas and dust input into the interstellar medium ( ism ) of these two nearby galaxies. we detected 24 carbon - rich agb stars and 19 possible extremely red objects ( eros ) in the spitzer bands, of which thirteen are spectroscopically confirmed to be agb based on their infrared colours. from the estimated mass - loss rates, we estimate that the ism enrichment by dust and gas is about 38 percent and 25 percent, respectively. the agb feedback rate is about 16 percent of the total ism mass, up to a dust mass of @xmath90.9@xmath10.2@xft. the ratio of the dust ejection rate to the star formation rate ( sfr ) is 1.1. we find that the current sfr is too high by about 20 percent compared to theoretical estimates. we show that this discrepancy could be caused by a missing of an important source of dust through the process of dust condensation in the uppermost layers of the circumstellar envelope ( i.e., super - winds and type ii supernovae ). the gas - to - dust ratios of oxygen - rich asymphers are relatively constant with temperature, suggesting that the main sources of dust are main sequence stars and sne. in the absence of eros in the northern part of the bar, which is consistent with the total stellar population, dust is not important. a census of the current lmc star formation seems to require an integrated rate of agb star formation lasting for at least 1 gyr. although the metallicity dependence of this rate is not strong, it is expected to be similar to or less than that from carbon - poor agb - stars. stars : agb ; ism : abundances ; galaxies : evolution ; stars : ism
the aim of this work is to present a unified description of spin - dependent and dissipative processes occurring in nanostructured ferromagnets in the thermokinetic regime. the description is based on the two conduction channel approximation, generalized to both intra-band relaxation and spin - accumulation. the application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, together with the conservation laws, leads to the spin- dependent transport equations. the onsager transport coefficients are defined and related to the typical electronic relaxation times. the effect of charge conservation and screening on the other hand, the ferromagnetic order parameter is described on an equal footing. the model is then generalized to deal with the chemical potentials and the underlying chemical potential ( for pur fluids ). the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation and the related nel - brown activation law are derived. the problem of magnetization switching in a nanostructure is one of the oldest problems in physics, and goes under the name _ open system thermodynamics _ for lack of a proper definition of the term _ magnetization _ itself. the term appears in several references, e.g. @xcite. it is defined in the sense of _ free energy _, ` ` entropy density _, or simply _ density of states _ in terms of the free energy of the system, i.e., the energy available to spin - transfer ( or entanglement ). a particularly interesting definition is the so - called _ irreversible spin transfer _, which is defined as the irreversible breaking of translational symmetry by a spin - polarized current ( in other words, the spin - unpolarized current ). this effect is due to the fact that a spin polarized current breaks ( or is impregnated by ) the lattice symmetry when it is subjected to a magnetic field that is of the order of a few @xmath0. in the case studied here, the relaxation is characterized by an effective flux of spins, distributed into the nanosecond or hundreds of picoseconds. the mechanism responsible for this effect, as well as the associated negative magnetization damping, is not yet fully understood. in what follows, we derive the relevant dissipative coupling, and establish the conditions for this kind of mechanism to work.
we present a non parametric model to relate the luminosity of a galaxy to the mass of the halo or subhalo which hosts it. we do this by assuming a monotonic and one to one relation between the luminosities of galaxies and the masses of the subhaloes. the model builds the total distribution of dark matter hosts based on physical theory, together with the empirically determined galaxy luminosity function. it is then used to compare the predicted number of galaxies in haloes of a given mass with the observational results of high resolution n - body simulations. overall, our results are a good match to the results of other theoretical models. we find however, that the adopted values of halo mass ( @xmath0 ) do not match the observed mass of galaxies. in order to allow for this, we have also introduced a simplified prescription for the average mass loss factor that we then apply to subhoe mass functions measured from simulations to regain the original subhalalo mass function. we argue that, for high mass haloes, the mass - luminosity relation appears to be mostly independent of the present mass fraction and of the cutoff mass that is used to calibrate the model. this indicates that it should be mostly correct, in the context of building a nonparametric model like we are doing. however, as a matter of fact, we find that the observed masses are slightly overestimated by the model, even though our result is consistent with the data and is not inconsistent with the cosmological model prediction. this could be caused by a slight overestimation of the overall galaxy mass and, more generally, mass of clusters and groups in the framework of our model. or, perhaps, could be cause by a wrong extrapolation of the observed halo masses. in any case, comparing our model to the data, and assuming that the model is correct, is a means of ensuring that future observational studies will be able to discriminate between different models.
we use numerical simulations to investigate the tilt in the fundamental plane ( fp ) relation produced by the merging of gas - rich disk galaxy models with dark matter halos. in agreement with previous work, we find that the fp relation is steepened ( @xmath0 ) by the inefficient cooling of collisionally heated gas in massive systems and by dynamic variations in the gas consumption timescale in smaller systems. dissipationless merging between spheroidal galaxy models similarly produces a fp tilt, but this is substantially weakened by the spread in the velocity dispersion of the progenitors. the magnitude of the tilt depends strongly on the total mass of the merging systems, with larger systems having shallower fp relations and higher stellar phase - space densities. the simulated fp is in good agreement with the virial theorem for homologous systems, but the gas dissipation experienced by the first generation of mergers is responsible for a deviation from the relation. we model the subsequent formation of at least one generation of elliptical galaxies, based on a prescription for accretion of gas from supermassive black holes and incorporating the effects of magnetic fields and feedback. these models faithfully reproduce the observed fp, but they have different scaling laws for the effective radius, stellar mass, and the mass in the final product. the effective radii of the elliptical remnants in our models are roughly proportional to the total - to - stellar mass ratio and have phases which are slightly shallower than the post - merger quiescent phase. the second generation of merger remnants have shallower central phases, but otherwise remain nearly parallel to the original fp. we conclude that the merger hypothesis for the formation of early - type galaxies is successful if the physics of gas cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole accretion are sufficiently important. furthermore, dissipation is significant when the dynamics of the merger can be modeled as a two - stage process.
we present zero - temperature optical spectroscopy of the heavily - doped semiconducting quantum metal cu@xmath0bi@x01se@xld2 at 295 k. single crystal samples were prepared via an electrochemical intercalation technique and allowed to vary the cu content from 0.15 to 0.42. we find that the band spectrum continuously increases with doping, attaining a peak value of @xmath5 at x=0.42, where the band gap is closed to a point unit ( bi ). in contrast to experiment, we do not detect a significant decrease in the in - plane scattering rate due to disorder. our results therefore suggest that cu doping does not dramatically increase the band mass within the doping range probed here. more surprisingly, our optical data also reveal that beyond simply adding carriers or introducing disorder, cu doping also impacts the electronic dispersion, as evinced by the increased _ effective _ mass. we discuss the implications of these results for the many - body picture of cu doping and suggest that the mass enhancement observed in our samples may be limited by band non - parabolicity rather than disorder. despite the apparent simplicity of the cu doping process, the electronic properties of our sample are qualitatively different from experiment. this is likely due to the large blue - shift of the direct optical gap, in the sense that dopant atoms now inside the van der waals gap tend to be shifted to lower positions. in addition, our results show that the change in the dispersion associated with the onset of theoga - stokes transition, likely does not faithfully reproduce the superconducting transition observed in the optical. finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for utilizing our results to determine the doping dependence of the diatomic content of the material. the discovery of heavy fermion metals, high - temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, and colossal magnetoresistance in manganates has stimulated extensive experimental and theoretical studies of these materials and extensive theoretical studies@xcite. a key feature of the materials studied so far is the metallicity of the host crystal, which is believed to be the optimal candidate for metal - insulator transitions. of particular importance to these studies is the tradeoff between energy and space, a quantity that is sensitive to the details of the crystal structure, and which is also the focus of intense theoretical and experimental investigations. for instance, it has been found that the phase diagram of copper - insrene superconductors is strongly influenced by the presence of dopants
we analyze a significant excess of @xmath0@xmath1 galaxies spatially concentrated around the quasars 3c 205 and q 0835 + 580, observed with the rossi long baseline array ( rlq ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ), which were also used to constrain the luminosity function ( lf ) of the population of early - type galaxies at the quasar redshifts. in the two fields with the best data, q 1126 + 101 and q 805 + 5, we find two significant excesses of galaxies with colors and apparent magnitudes consistent with the presence of young, dusty galaxies. one of these has a color distribution redder than that of the field population and is at least 1.6 mag fainter than the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) emission - line redshift. the other is roughly constant in color and magnitude to within 0.3 mag of the bcg luminosity. the colors and magnitude of both excess populations are consistent with them being early - types and are indistinguishable from each other. the excess galaxies have a relatively high surface density in both fields, and the surface density is similar to that seen in random - field surveys in the literature. the magnitudes and colors of the two excess populations, as well as the lack of excesses in other fields, place these galaxies in the context of the large - scale formation of cluster ellipticals and groups at = 12. we identify a candidate abell richness class of 23 gyr old ellipticals within the 0.51 mpc field containing the excess, suggesting that these could be the progenitors of the present - day cluster galaxies and help to determine the high - redshift mass - to - light ratio by 3000. we find a substantial excess of faint, low - metallicity galaxies associated with a group of nearby abell rich clusters or groups located on a much smaller scale than the larger - scale cluster or group overdensity. the small scale overdensity may be due to a radial break in the seds of the nearby objects or to a dispersion in the intrinsic stellar populations of the cluster galaxies.
the production of electron - cyclotron maser radiation in the auroral kilometric radiation source region has been argued to be a localised effect of the grainy structure of the electron distribution. it has been shown, in particular, that the emission frequency in the hole in configuration space, which originates from the instability of the buneman mode, can be significantly enhanced by electron holes in the momentum space. a simple model of the mechanism has been proposed, in which the holes are localised entities moving at a restricted range of velocities and in which radiation is emitted perpendicular to the magnetic field. we have compared the efficacy of this model with the electron data and argue that it accounts for the limited perpendicular extension of electron holes observed in the velocity space. such holes necessarily exist and can be generated by the parallel buneman instability. moreover, we show that the holes produce band limited radiation with emitted frequency at doppler shifted frequency. the emitted wavelength corresponds to wavelengths comparable to the observed fine structure bandwidths. based on these results, we conclude that electron holes necessarily originate from the point source of radiation. = 14.8 cm = -0.5 cm @xmath0laboratoire dannecy, ecole normale suprieure de physique thorique, umr 5207, cnrs / in2p3, universit de valence, 46100 rue lhomond, france ( @xiff ). @xcite the pointed green bank telescope, the european southern observatory, po box 513, epping, nsw 1710, switzerland, altaddress = department of physics, f-85741 annecy, university of durham, dh1 3le, dork, uk address = departamento de fsica terica, universidade federal do rio grande do norte, 59072 - 970, natal, rn, brazil address = inst. for theor. about particle physics, see eur. phys. j. b * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3@xmath4departament dpto. fsica aplicada e experimental, instituto politcnico nacional autnoma de mxico, s / n - lagoa nova, av. rovisco pais, p.o. box 1049, 04510 lisboa, italy, and nova
the problem of neutrino mass and oscillation properties has been studied in the last decade through many different experimental techniques. since the experiments starting in 1999, there have been major advances in our understanding of the physics of solar neutrinos. in particular the energy spectrum, the angular index and the day night asymmetries have been determined with high accuracy. the measurements of neutrinoless double @xmath0 decays, performed in solar and atmospheric experiments, have been able to establish, for the first time, the existence of oscillating electrons. the best result from solar experiments in recent years has been the one of super - kamiokande ( sk ) that has been found to be positive, which implies a mass difference between the left and the right handed flavors of this particle that is ( i ) almost an order of magnitude larger than the one expected from the standard model ( ssm ) prediction, ( ii ) consistent with the results of other experiments, ( iii ) likely to be close to the ssm prediction and ( iv ) possibly pointing towards a hint of oscillation in the left handed end of the spectrum. we will discuss these results in detail in the rest of the paper. we conclude by some predictions that may be useful for the future experiments. # 1#2#3astropart. phys. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 acta phys. pol. * b#1*@xmath1 # 2 - 3 erg cm^-2 - 2 erg s^-1 - 1 cm_#1^#2_#3 # 1eq.

a new algorithm for simulating gene regulatory networks is presented. it is based on the kinetic monte carlo technique, and relies on importance sampling in trajectory space. rather than generating transition paths one at a time, new paths are generated by making changes to existing paths. a new path is accepted or rejected according to its weight in the transition path evaluation ensemble. the rate constants for the reactions on the left and right - hand sides of the ensemble are the same. the scheme is applied to calculations of switching rates for biochemical networks simulated with the gillespie algorithm. we demonstrate the ffs method by simulating a simplified example of the genetic switch, in which only one dimer can be bound at any time, and discuss how it can be used to study rare events in biochemical networks. significance sampling, which makes new pathsynthesis possible, is a fundamental aspect of chemical kinetics, and has been extensively studied in the context of biological sciences @xcite. the method presented in this article makes use of it to study _ in vivo _ examples of biochemical networks, as well as any stochastic dynamical scheme, such as langevin or brownian dynamics. although the algorithm is not designed to study deterministic dynamical processes, it is applicable to systems with deterministic dynamics : although it can not be be used for a simulation based on a physical equation, it has been widely used in studies of soft condensed matter systems such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, or non - equilibrium processes such as dna stretching. the methods presented here are the first of a series that aims to describe how a biochemical network can prepare and reset new paths in a transparent manner, with as little as possible knowledge of the stationary distribution of states. the approach presented here is different from previous schemes of simulating reaction networks ; it is ` ` real - time '', and does not require the development of a numerical solution of the chemical master equation.
the stellar content of the sculptor group galaxy ngc 247 is investigated using images obtained with the cfht and gemini south telescopes. megaprime data cover the entire disk of the galaxy, and provide the first comprehensive census of bright main sequence stars and supergiants in this galaxy. while not completely sampled, the data allow the properties of rsgs in three spatially distinct regions to be investigated, and thus provide an independent means of checking some of the trends found at shorter wavelengths. gmos data are used to investigate the stellar content in the disk and in a small portion of the extraplanar disk that falls outside of the detected hi disk. it is found that the rgb stars in gmos field 2 have a broad range of metallicities, spanning from z @xmath0 0.0001 to at least z = 0.004. a comparison with the isochrones in this region of the control field cmd shows that some of these agb stars are simply the brightest members of an old population, and they may not be gravitationally bound. interestingly, the angular momentum vectors of rgb stars tend to be aligned, indicating a common origin of angular momentum and a shared evolutionary heritage during early epochs. no evidence is found for a significant population of stars that are too faint to be agb ; in fact, a statistically corrected cmd reveals that the faint end of the rgb sequence is not populated by any objects that are significantly brighter than the brightest red giant. a number of stars above the log(t@xmath1 main sequence turn - off ) are detected, and these can be used to estimate the recent star formation rate ( sfr ) in a direct manner. sfr values were computed using sfrs using resolved stars as a tracer, and overall the results are consistent with other estimators. the sfr for ngc247 is 0.09 m@xft2year@xfig3.
we study mass linear functions on simple polytopes. in particular, we show that if every polytope supports a nonconstant mass linear function then it is also affine equivalent to a product of simplices. this implies that no polytopope of dimension @xmath0 does not admit a noncanvasous mass function. on the other hand, however, we find that very different classes of polytropes do and are not supported by noncanavanic mass functions. this allows us to introduce a classification of the classes of surfaces which do and do not admit noncangetic functions. we call these classes ` ` inessential ''. we also extend our analysis to facets with nonzero symmetry ; we find a new class of facets that are not inessential. this leads to a complete list of objects that do not have inessential functions. as a byproduct, we obtain several new results on this class of objects. for example, we prove that not only does every polytropic object admit inessential function, but also every facet admits an implement of the isomorphism group of a finite subtor toric manifold. we moreover show that in all but an exponentially increasing number of cases, facets of a polytropism object are considered to be inessential, that is, they must be either pervasive or flat. * on the one hand, many geometric constructions constructed with linear schur algebras have as their dual objects a multitude of possible forms for which we can name ` ` polytopes ''. it is well known that the bipartite polytopes are the only ones which are allowed by hamiltonian invariants if and only if the isometric invariants with the same symmetry. in the opposite case, no linear complex algebraic properties are allowed. this generically leads to the problem we address in this paper : is there an action of the group of affine transformations on a polytopesi? it is easy to see that many physical objects with this property are tools to manipulate the fundamental group of solutions to a certain euclidean space, but it is not straightforward how to define an action which generalizes to the general case. our approach to this problem, which we describe in detail in section [ sec : strategy ], has the following advantages. first, we provide a complete and systematic description of the key features of symmetric and asymmetric facets. we analyze the structure of facets arising in this way, we are able to determine the coefficients of the support numbers
we use collisionless n - body simulations to predict the amount of and in the universe. our simulations include a press - schechter halo abundance and a cosmological constant. we find that all lyman limit absorption we find resides within dark matter halos. an improvement over the gardner ( 1997a ) results is made when we include the contribution of small halos to statistics. we predict the number of systems @xmath0 in our simulations and find that this number is in excellent agreement with the observations. we revisit an unresolved issue raised by kauffmann ( 1996 ) for the scdm model, namely the distribution of projected separations between and systems. we assume that the and absorption cross - sections are related by a single universal mechanism, but our simulations indicate that the relationship is not universal and varies from model to model. this suggests that different mechanisms have to be considered for the consistency of the observed distribution. in order to reconcile our predicted and observations, we investigate the size of simulated hosts. in each simulation, we identify a friends - of - friends potential source for absorption. we check the stability of this potential source by comparing the simulations with observations, but find that it is unstable and it would collapse within a few gyr. we then investigate the effects of cosmology on the statistics of and. in all cases, the predicted number of and absorption is substantially below the observed number. this implies that for any of the cosmologies considered, and in any case that is compatible with the observed, absorption must arise in halos within halos, in significant contrast to the scenario in which all and absorption arise in spherically symmetric universes. psfig.tex # 1#2#3#4 # 1, _ # 2 _, * # 3 *, # 4 = 0.65 cm r. a. bransford@xmath1, r. b. brown@xfig1, d. g. cassel@x$1, h. c. choi, m. d. harvey, and r. l. byer, _ high redshift galaxy : structure, evolution, and formation _ ( springer, 2010 )
we investigate the equivalence relations on the space of iterated level - k - supertile subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath0. in this paper we will use a construction of a equivalence relation on this subspace to prove that all these regions are homeomorphic, or equivalently the only way to do that is to build a product space over the space is to make a partition of the space into a subset with a particular topology. the key tool in this construction is the product topology, which is a subset of the topology of the set of all finite sets of products. the structure of the product space turns out to be very useful in construction of the minimal models of quantum fields, and it has been a useful tool in the fields of quantum information and condensed matter physics. we will prove that the minimal model for the global coverings of the cw - complex is a homeomorphism, that is, the following theorem of melbourne and ammar says that all minimal models involving a finite set of iterates of a 1-dimensional hyperbolic 2-dimensional site is equivalent to the minimality of a locally finite set. the existence of such a minimal model was predicted by john hutchinson @xcite and hence the idea has been studied in the context of quantum field theory. he considered a family of systems in the category of non - commutative 3-manifolds. the main result of this paper is theorem [ l_m, x^1_n,\sim_p { [ l',x'']_{\gap{\mathrm{isom}}$ ] which says that two iterated levels - k [ l,\gap(1 ) ] tiles are equivalent if they are equivalent, or more precisely, if they have the same height. our notation use the word equivalent in the sense that means that two collared edges define a subspace and there is a subrule that describes the interior of every collared tile that minimizes the height of one edge. for a while it is easy to see that there is only one way to construct a lower bound on the number of collared tiles, it seems to be quite difficult to extend the notion of minimality to infinitely many. however, if we consider globally iterated iterated systems instead of locally iterated ones, and assume that the dimension of the tile is not infinite, we can endow the subspace with a category - preserving isometry that preserves the decorations of the collared
we study the box - office revenue and the distribution of popularity of movies after they are released in a particular year, using data from the three most prolific feature film producing nations in the world : india, usa and japan. for our analysis we use the data of 5,222 movies released in the period 1999 - 2004, where the total gross receipt at the box office for each movie is greater than @xmath0 usd. we show scaling in the decay of the income of a movie with its production budget, we have also looked at the time - evolution of popularity ( i.e., the duration up to which a movie is shown at theaters ). this observation leads us to suggest that popularity can be viewed as a sequential survival process over many successive time periods, where a successful product or idea is one that survives being withdrawn from circulation for far longer than its competitors. the general properties observed for movie popularity may also be relevant for other instances of popularity. for movies, as for most other products competing for attention by potential consumers / adopters, it is an empirically observed fact that only a very few end up dominating the market. there are thousands of books, movies, authors and actors who live their entire inconspicuous lives beneath the featureless sea of noise that is modern popular culture ". in fact, the almost all movies released every year do not attract enough viewers. the following comment made about bollywood, the principal indian film production and distribution system, applies also to motion picture industries worldwide : fewer than 8 out of the more than 800 films made each year [ in bollywood ] will make serious money ". this has been the dominant marketing strategy for successful big budget movies which are collectively referred to as blockbusters ". we also agree with the universal property that movies are generally more popular than movies that are less popular.
we propose a transmission scheme, generalized spatial index modulation ( gsim ), which uses transmit radio frequency ( rf ) chains in multi - antenna systems to encode bits through indexing. in spatial modulation, the number of transmit antennas is restricted to powers of two, and in any given channel use, at any given time, only one antenna will be active and the other antennas will be silent. the index of the active transmit antenna will also convey, for the first time, indexing both in space as well as frequency domain. we take the view that spatial modulation is an instance of the general idea of ` index modulation '. indexing in the frequency domain ( e.g., spatial modulation ) is a particular case of this technique where information bits are conveyed through indices of certain transmit entities. in this paper, we present the gsfim system model, analyze its achievable rate, and derive upper and lower bounds for the rate in gsim. an analysis of achievable rate shows that gsim can achieve better rates and lower transmit rf chains compared to spatial multiplexing, especially in the medium to high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime. we also investigate the performance of gsim in terms of the range of system parameters, including achievable rate in bits per channel use ( bpcu ), and space shift keying performance. we show that the gsim system can be viewed as a superclass of mimo - ofdm where the spectral efficiency can be enhanced by spatial modulation. in the high snr regime, it is shown that gspacewave can achieve a rate improvement with respect to conventional mimo. as a specific receiver, we propose a detection algorithm for gsim based on gibbs sampling which can attain a rate performance better than that of spatial modulation while still maintaining the same rate performance. additionally, we analyze the robustness of the proposed detection algorithm against the block - error correction, and show that it can attain better performance than standard brute - force ml detection.
the two - component atomic cooling rate ( 2-caz ) is a promising new cooling method for a @xmath0rb gas. it is based on optically pumping two rb atoms simultaneously in a far off - resonance optical trap. this technique avoids the use of magnetic traps such as magnetic micro - traps and magnetic coils. in addition, the light - assisted spin - exchange collisions that occur due to exchange interactions in the f=2 and f=3 states of the colliding atoms are avoided. for optimal cooling parameters the atoms do not have to be in hyperfine - changing collisions. the advantages of this cooling scheme are that it is three - dimensional, the energy removed per scattered optical pumping photon is proportional to the gas temperature, and the high density of the atoms prevents hyperfine changing collisions to significantly limit the total energy in the system. however, the complications that occur in light - based methods such as reabsorption cooling impose constraints on the cooling rate. to overcome these limitations two - cavity sub - doppler cooling with two different types of atoms has been proposed. in this paper we report on an experimental realization of 2-ca z@xmath1az cooling with just one rb atom. we show that by using a simple all - optical optical pumping scheme it is possible to achieve cooling rates comparable to those that require a magnetic trapping or a large magneto - optical trap ( mots ). we also report a successful thermodynamic measurement of the on - resonance microwave excitation probability and the steady - state population of a two - atom system showing that 2caz cooling is efficient while maintaining the isotope character of the gas. the techniques used in this work demonstrate a potential for efficient cooling in a variety of situations. recent years have seen a growing interest in the cooling of heavy elements due to their potential for technological applications in spintronics and quantum information processing @xcite. for instance, spintronic devices require a low - temperature gas to be cooled below a temperature of a few hundred k. to reach the desired temperature it is necessary to cool the gas to a temperature where the majority of the electrons are in the spin - singlet / triplet ground state. to reach such a low temperature, the cooling must be performed in a regime where the magnetic field is strong enough to produce an effective zeeman field ( e.g. l2 and l3 colliding atom beams ). while laser cooling of atoms in magnetic traps is generally accomplished through laser cooling from a few tens of mev
we are developing a potential to incoporate the surface sputtering process that is needed to improve the description of the energy transport in alloys and fcc random binary alloys. the essence of this potential is to develop a general one that can be applied to any ( or most ) materials located in any environment. we discuss some of the well known potentials in the literature which are not general enough for our goal, source : @xmath0+\frac{1}\sum_i \sum_{j\ne i}\phi_{ij}\nu}\right)\ ] ] + this is the many - body embeded - atom model ( eam ) potential to model the energetics of the transition metals. we develop a density functional theory, that is, the rate at which the number of atoms in the lattice increases and decreases due to the energy delivered by the sputtering particles landing on the surface. we study the variations in the way each atom receives this energy. for an ionic lattice like that of nacl, we could have two unique forms of the eam potentials. one is a pairwise central and the other is a very sensitive to the details of the atomic arrangements. in both cases, we have atomic arrangements where there are many layers and they are all lumpy. we also find that the population of ionised atoms is always changing. that is because initially as the sputtered process starts, we shall have a larger number of first ionisation atoms but as that number reduces, we will have that number reducing while the nth ionisation energy of the atoms increases. this is a result of the fact that the two - body, pairwise repulsive interactions are always stronger than the single body, which leads to a more complex system. also, we identify a major reason why contributions to sputtering by temperature variations is crucial to a successful model for surface interactions. + we present the possible applications of our potentials, such as modelling the chemical reactions and the formation of bio - filaments. there is a clear connection between our potential and the one of abrikosov - nielsen _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 102 *, 124501 ( 2009 ) ]. the real world applications of these potentials are diverse. one application is the development of novel devices such as life - support devices, biomimetic structures or devices that can sense and control bacterial and viral infections. another application is designing water soluble antimicrobial coatings for applications such as
we report on the results from long - term optical and x - ray monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516 using the wise observatory 1 m telescope in mitzpe ramon, israel. we provide more than six years of data, spanning 1997 march to september 2, covering more than eight months. the optical light curves extend over a period of more than ten months, with a deep minimum located at 0.140.18 kev. the @xmath0-band light curve shows no significant variability on timescales shorter than about one day, and has a gaussian distribution of integrated intensity that is well described by a power - law with an index of 1.1. the deviation from this correlation may be explained in terms of a difference in the mean luminosity of the nuclear stellar population and, possibly, central black hole mass, although the available data do not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. continued monitoring after 1999 january with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _, the _ asca _, and _ euve _ satellites, will provide stronger constraints on the correlation properties. we have also collected about one - third of the total optical variability in a single photometric epoch, corresponding to about five years of observations. the light curves vary by about a factor of two during the first four months of our monitoring period. the dominant optical variation is in a two - month - long deep minimum centered around day 1000, followed by a rise and fall inactivity during the next two months. this lag is much stronger than the 100-day lag observed in the x - rays. we examine the implications of these results within the framework of the popular ` ` ` absorption - in - by - emission '' model for agns, in which the optical emission is produced by the accretion disk, and not the disk - emitting black hole. the similarity between the optical - to - optical variations in the first 350 days can be seen clearly in the correlation function, and the linear relation that minimizes the sum of the differences between different optical points, with the zero - lag timescale being about 110 days.
we present maps of the regions at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m in the horsehead nebula, made by habart et al. ( 2005 ) using the submillimetre common user bolometer array. these maps show the presence of two extended sources : smm1, associated with the hii region ic434, and smm2, which is seen as an absorption dip against the more prominent l1630 background emission. the flux densities of the two sources were measured from the same data archive. we have an estimate of the absolute calibration error of our image. the ` top'of the horse s head is the source with the highest flux density ; its size is about 40 kpc. the shape of the remainder of the image is somewhat curved, as is the edge of the obscuration seen at the very end of the nebula. the source at the upper part of the spectrum is larger than the other source, and is probably the source of the observed cloud density. from the width of its spectrum we derive a temperature of 13.5 k and a mass of 2 m@xmath2. the mean density of the molecular cloud associated with smm 1 is close to the value usually observed for dust in molecular clouds, which suggests that the cloud is either virialized or destined to spawn a massive star. we discuss various scenarios for the formation of these two sources, such as an instability of the disk caused by a large - scale velocity dispersion, or an ionisation front driven by the motion of a cloud along the line - of - sight. the qualitative differences between these scenarios and the established models are discussed.

we study the light scattered by cometary dust particles. we consider dusts made of fractal particles, with electric charges or by a reaction - limited cluster - cluster aggregation model ( rcca ). we also examine the effects of porosity, of the type considered here, on the particle scattering profile. we find that the porous / fluffy aggregates are compact in the sense ( fractal dimension of the bpca aggregates is 3 ), but may exhibit irregular compact shapes as well, depending on the physical conditions. this is the case for the comets and the data obtained from interplanetary scattering experiments. the porosity is one of the parameters that characterizes the rigidity of the aggregates. in our models, the polarization is always centered at the origin ( the origin of the polarization from the scattering geometries is ). when theugal force is large, masses of the aggregate particles areifted away from the region where light scattering is supposed to occur ( the effect of the porousity ). this leads to a polarization far bluer than that of the spherical aggregate, but to a consistent polarization regardless of the dimensions. the shape parameters are determined by the energy and the refractive index of the scattered material. we found that the closed porosity gives rise to a blue - shifted polarization with max - value @xmath0, whereas the open porosity does not allow such a red - shift. the polarization of the individual comets is also calculated and found to be highly dependent on their galactocentric distance. however, the scatter of the cometary photons by the neighboring dust particles is also an important factor that determines their polarization. our results are in good agreement with the existance of the halley s comet and other galaxies, and we have been able to obtain consistent data with their astrophysical instruments. we discuss the possible technological applications of our results, which may allow us to interact with the data of other astrophysical objects.
we present near - infrared photometry, stellar mass - to - light ratios, and bulge and disk mass correlations in a sample of 35 low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbg ) at @xmath0. this is the largest sample of lsbg observations from any wavelength, and contains some of the most massive galaxies ever studied, as well as a number of normal spiral galaxies with luminosities comparable to those of normal spirals. we find that the central surface brightness of the stellar disk ( i.e. the high surface brightness bulges ) correlates strongly with the near - ir luminosity and hi mass, such that the galaxies have low gas mass fractions. however, we find no ` ` floor '' in the total baryonic mass required for bulge formation, and that the total mass increases by a factor of more than 20 with increasing gas mass fraction. assuming that there is no large scale segregation between baryons and dark matter, our sample spans the range of metallicity but has _ not _ defined a time scale that correlates with either hi mass or stellar mass. we interpret our results in the context of a scenario in which galaxies have been enriched by merging over recent times, and are then subject to hydrodynamic collapse. in this scenario, the present stellar mass is due to the infall of large amounts of gas, and the subsequent star formation is then efficiently transferred to the stars, and subsequently onto the dark matter. the gas density is then directly related to the age of the galaxies, and could be used to constrain the star formation timescale. we detect a strong correlation between the gas surface density and the magnitude of the rotation curve, suggesting that the radius of an lsbg is set by its current star formation rate. there are also clear correlations between the morphologies and the mass - fraction relation, including a high frequency of disk - dominated lsbg whose morphologies show evidence for very late star formation. we suggest that the formation of a bulge is associated with an extremely efficient epoch of star formation, in which gas is driven to very high central densities as it is converted into stars.
we report on hst / stis observations of the strontium - enriched ( ) filament in the equatorial region between the hourglass - shaped bipolar homunculus and the weigelt nebula. the spectrum of the emission from the filament is significantly different from that from anywhere else in the nebula, allowing us to diagnose the physical conditions of the emitting plasma. for the first time 2 is seen in emission spectra, as its ionization potential has never been explicitly described in the literature. the relative abundances of the elements studied in this paper are in good agreement with the results from all other observations. we derive a mean temperature of 6000 k for the filament and find a large overabundance of titanium with respect to both iron and nickel. the possible photoevaporation of the gas, or a more complex phase with different condensation temperatures, are possible scenarios to explain these results. we also find that the 2-to - fe ratio is large and the ratio of 2 to fe is very uncertain. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 = cmr5 = cmti7 = cmmib10 = mtssy7 = mtmib5 = = = [ firstpage ] circumstellar matter stars : individual ( 2 ). magellan 3.1 abdus salam international centre for astrophysics, cape, surrey, rh5 6nt, canada laboratory for astronomy, university of massachusetts, amherst, massachusetts 01003, usa ] donc dept. of astronomy, coronas astr., p.o. box 513, sleptons, ma 3. 5. notre dame cedex, service de physique thorique, universit de provence, 38 rue frdric - joliot - curie, f-13388 coulter, france _ norwegian meteorological institute, karlsruhe institute of technology, wolfgang - gaede - str. 1, 85748 nada, germany _ astroparticle physics group, nasa / goddard space flight center, + 4800 oak grove drive, charlottesville, va 22904 @xmath0 these authors contributed equally to this work.
we study the pearson coefficient, i.e., the average number of vertices of degree @xmath0 in a recursive network, as a function of the vertex degree. our main result is that for a wide class of recursive networks growing due to an arbitrary linear preferential attachment of new vertices, we observe zero pearson s coefficient. these networks include random recursive trees with rapidly decaying and even exponential degree distributions. we demonstrate that this result is practically exact for large networks. furthermore, we find that the asymptotics of degree degree correlations in these networks are scale - free. this result demonstrates the importance of the assortative principle and of the monotonous evolution of networks. finally, we show that the small - world analogy is an exact observation of the real world and may form a new theoretical tool for describing the growth of complex networks. complexity in networks is usually expressed by the so - called schrdinger equation which describes the correlations among the vertices in a network @xcite. since the early days of statistical physics, this equation has been a subject of intense research in the social and natural sciences. it has been extensively applied to the study of the network formation processes, from the individual and system level, to the technological and economic processes of a wide variety of systems such as the society, the web, or the transportation system. in this paper we focus on the systems that are most complex and rapidly growing. these systems include recursive networks in which each new vertex is attached to other vertices randomly, as well as the world - wide web, which grows by preferential attachment. these growing networks are characterised by strong structural correlations including power laws between the degrees of the nearest - neighbor vertices. despite these correlations, we do not know exactly what is the price paid by the nodes for their contributions to the network growth. in the first case, it is easy to see that the system is growing and there is no reason to worry about the quantity of the size of the correlation. thus we often refer to these systems as _ recursive networks_. in the infinite network limit, however, there is an interesting phenomenon that we are not aware of. namely, we can only assume that the three nodes ( edges, roots, and edges ) are connected by a single connected vertex, which is the same for every vertex. we call this model _ finite network limit_. this limit corresponds to the infinite size limit of the system as a whole and can be obtained by a finite - size estimation of the exponent of the degree distribution.
we show that the topological invariant @xmath0 is equivalent to the so called chern numbers which are well defined in the thermodynamic limit. therefore, we classifies the fiber bundles generated by families of projectors whose energy lives on the base manifold. we show how to define the spin - chern number by directly defining the spin up and spin down sectors, as well as the spectral gap for spin up states. finally, we describe how to extend the classification to 2 dimensional fiber bundles without boundary conditions. the classifications we present provide a new way to estimate the robustness of topological insulators against disorder, which is a new concept in this field. institute for theoretical physics, san diego state university, san derbie, ca 92182, usa department of mathematics, university of massachusetts amherst, massachusetts 01003 usa random field theory has had a long and successful successful application in the theory of quantum fluctuations.@xcite in particular, it has been able to elucidate many puzzles in condensed matter physics, such as the nature of the mass gap in the hamiltonian of diffeomorphisms of states with different energy eigenvalues. more recently, a new approach to classifying topological conformal field theory was introduced by carollo,wang and carolus.\xcite this approach has been used extensively in the study of the bulk properties of materials. for example, the classifying of the conductors is based on the analytical expression for the conductivity in the hilbert space. this classification was extended to much more than pure conductors but also extended to quantum phases of matter. various extensions of the classification were proposed, including classification in the kagom class. most of the extensions were designed to avoid the problems associated with the physical implementation but some of the results were so crude as to be unacceptable. the purpose of this paper is to give a new interpretation to one of the most fascinating constructions known to physics : fiber bundles. we will introduce the classification scheme and we will point out some of its possible applications.
the properties of the stellar population of ngc6397 as determined with deep ir observations obtained with the nicmos camera on board the hubble space telescope are quite consistent with those derived from similarly deep wfpc2 observations. in particular, down to the bottom of the main sequence, there are no stars contributing significantly to the low - mass budget of this cluster. thus, the unavailability of nicmos will not hinder this investigation in the future. a comparison of our deep ir cmd with the theoretical models of baraffe et al. ( 1997 ) shows the agreement to be excellent, thus proving that the latter are reliable also in the ir domain. the luminosity function ( lf ) measured for main sequence ( ms ) stars near the cluster s half - light radius, when corrected for the contamination due to foreground and background objects, confirms that the local mf is a power - law with exponent @xmath0, from which the apparent flattening at low masses is deduced. we show that this localized mf can not reproduce the established global mf if power - laws are used to convert lf into mf. in fact, the mf determined using the m - l relation for the global distribution of stars is consistent with ( poorly defined ) multi - mass models including internal dynamical evolution ( mass segregation ) and/or radiation field effects. these models imply that the number of stars per unit mass drops with increasing radius, in a manner similar to that expected for the ms h - burning limit. since such a flattening is expected to be true for any cluster irrespective of its dynamical state, if the cluster is in an evolutionary state and has not experienced too strong an interaction with the galactic tidal field or bulge, it suggests that the imf has to flatten out or else, without the aid of external probes, very faint, red stars might not be very attractive and, therefore, they might escape detection with future instruments. we also show that the gmf of the whole cluster population can be reproduced with a log - normal distribution, while the individual mass distribution of the very low- and intermediate mass stars seems to be a function of that type. finally, we address a third possible implication of our results, namely whether the observed flattening of the mass function might be a feature intrinsic in the cluster imf or, even, an intrinsic property of the core, and we provide some tests of this possibility using the data obtained together.
recent experiments have indicated that an insulating mott insulator can exist even below half - filling in the two - dimensional hubbard model. despite extensive theoretical and numerical efforts, the nature of the mott gap and its relationship to the quasiparticle bandstructure remain largely unknown. here, we use a slave - particle approach to provide a self - consistent explanation for such an unusual phenomenon and deduce the charge dynamics for all intermediate ( and experimentally relevant ) interaction strengths. this approach is based on the observation that the holon - doublon slave - fermion exchange, which occurs when bosonic magnons order magnetically at zero temperature, also involves the formation of bound pairs of fermionic holons and doublons. we show that the on - site interaction determines the magnitude of the excitation gap, which in turn is determined by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations. the density of states, the spectral function and the luttinger surface of the model, are deduced from the lack of a transition at any finite interaction strength. the optical conductivity displays the intrinsically two - state structure, with the high- and low - energy bands strongly interacting with each other, and a mott - insulating ground state. we prove that for any value of the hubbard hopping parameter, the ground state is a magnetically ordered state. the strong - coupling limit of our approach yields excellent agreement with resonant inelastic x - ray scattering measurements performed on quasi-2d spin-@xmath0iro antiferraids. we ascribe the ferromagnetic correlations to quantum fluctuations acting on the charge carriers, while the correlations on the electron green function are described by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) statistical mechanics. this analogy between bcs and the schrdinger equation provides a simple and intuitive explanation of the discrepancies between the various reported measurements and theoretical predictions of the disorder - induced metal - insulator transition out of the fermi - liquid metallic phase. the investigation of strongly - correlated electron models is a subject that has received much recent attention, both from fundamental physical studies ( e.g., see @xcite ) and from numerical simulations ( see eur. phys. j. a * 81 *, 7891 ( 2010 ) ). despite such recent progress, the mathematical models providing a most accurate description of these systems remain as challenging to solve. in this paper, we aim to provide an analytical framework which captures the essential features of the
we develop a formal theory of social influence that shows that besides monoculture and individualism, there is a third, pluralistic phase of opinion clustering that is characterized by a striving for uniqueness. it occurs, when individuals interact with each other and their opinions become extreme, even if there is perfect consensus in the beginning. our model does not assume negative influence, and it behaves markedly different from bounded confidence models, in which white opinion noise produces fragmentation rather than clustering. it shows that the functional role that randomness, fluctuations, or other sources of variability ( i.e., opinion fluctuations ) plays for the organization of social systems can be fully described by the model. our results identify conditions under which pluralism can flourish, which are meaningful for the analysis of the social integration of our societies. _ keywords _ : opinion dynamics, durkheimian models, pluralism, white noise _ _ ams subject classification _ : 60k37, 60k35, 65k35. _ @xmath0 : universit degli studi di milano - bicocca, dipartimento di fisica, universit ` ` la sapienza '', + centro mixto universit delle scienze 3, 35122 milano, italy + e - mail : lorenzo.dudley@fisica.it _ _ many social systems exhibit self - organized collective behavior, which is often described as individualist or pluralism @xcite. a typical example for such a phenomenon is the hierarchical organization of cultural, religious, and social behavior in the societies that are rich in traditions, traditions, and traditions. in recent years, the emergence and persistence of pluralism is a striking phenomenon in a world in which social networks are highly connected and social influence is an ever present force that reduces differences between those who interact. it is generally accepted as a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of collective behaviors, ranging from traditions, beliefs, or traditions to the behavior of individuals. at the same time, it has been shown that particular forms of collective behavior can emerge through the interactions of large numbers of individuals, and the resulting collective behavior is quite different from what is observed for typical social systems, such as family, opinion formation, or migration. a common background to most of these phenomena is the tendency of individuals to develop individual opinions, even when they do not interact with others in a specific social system. this tendency to strive for uniqueness ( anomie ) was first observed
we present new models of the chemical evolution of m 4 and ngc 2808 that include new yields for oxygen - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars from @xmath0 to 8@xmath1. oxygen abundance patterns based on these models are shown to be compatible with the abundance patterns observed in the globular cluster ( gc ) m 4 by carretta et al. ( 2010 ). the new yields broaden the range of possible star formation pathways so that models can be used to investigate the formation of multiple stellar populations in a variety of globular clusters. we explore the possibility of two epochs of star formation, separated by a few myr from the start of the super agb phase, and a further phase of supernovae ( sn ii ) from the agb ejecta. in some cases the second star formation epoch may last as long as 20 myr. we find that models with a short sg formation phase, as found by d2010, can also reproduce the observed helium abundance in the cluster. however, these models require a more massive fg cluster to be able to reproduce the helium abundance of the sg, and the consequent intense sg star formation due to the increased amount of available gas. we conclude that models based on modified versions of the o na and mg al anticorrelations may produce sg abundances that are too small by a factor of two compared to those derived from the original o na plane. this is because the expansion of the fg and the dilution with pristine gas both lead to a fragmentation of the oxygen abundance into groups with different metallicities. these groups have similar average metallicities, but different characteristic morphologies and the resulting number ratio of sg to fg stars is dependent on the initial mass function. the models presented can also explain the observed bimodal helium abundance distribution of m 30, the only cluster in which oxygen has not yet been detected.
we investigate the effects of fluctuations in the uv background on the statistical properties of the forest as measured in high redshift quasi - stellar object ( qso ) spectra. the simulations assuming early homogeneous and reionization reproduce the cumulative flux distributions and column density distributions measured to an accuracy of a few percent, but they do not provide accurate estimates of the widths of the absorption features. when we average over the redshift interval @xmath0, we find that the mean flux from each spectrum ( the power spectrum at each redshift ) is nearly identical to the other ( the flux transmission auto - correlation function ), with a small scatter at lower redshifts. qso absorption is found to track the total matter density in the forest, with gas with overdensities a few times the mean density. the gas also closely traces the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. we estimate the effect of small systematic offsets in the continuum level, as provided by meiksin, bryan & machacek for the two best - fitting models to the flux distribution, and consider the impact on the computed power spectra of press, gnedin & hamilton ( 2002 ), songaila & cowie ( 1993 ), croft et al. ( 1999, 2002a ) and hui & tegmark ( 2001 ). we conclude that press measurements at moderate resolution are likely to be significantly affected by the fluctuating background, but that no significant effect from hydrostatic fluctuations on the column density is required to account for the observed trends. we ltely infer the errors on the flux power spectrum from the fits to the high resolution spectra, and we compare these with the flux decrement values of steidel & sargent ( 1987 ). the errors provided correspond to the equivalent errors in the equivalent gaussian errors. all estimates are in accord with each other, including those of press. the agreement between the predictions and the observed fluxes suggests that a moderate - resolution simulation of the intergalactic medium in good spectral quality should be capable of providing accurate measurements of the clustering of qso galaxies. 3cm^-3 # 1to 0pt#1 cosmology : theory large - scale structure of universe
we study the spin correlations of the nucleons in a nucleus and demonstrate that they play a major role in determining the m1 nuclear transition amplitudes and the paramagnetic susceptibility. we show that the correlation function of the two - spin density matrix of a nucleus is highly sensitive to the nuclear susceptibility. a decisive test of our results will be made _ e.g. _ with two - proton radioactivity. bertruani s work @xcite for weakly bound nucleons implies that there are non - negligible spin quantum correlations effects in nucleons. therefore, we ask, namely, do quantum correlations play a role on the observables that depend on the spin ofthe nucleon pair? we start our discussion by considering the effect of spin quantum statistics on m1 nucleon spin correlations at the level of @xmath0. we expect that the suppressed m1 transition is suppressed, or even forbidden, due to pauli blocking and the energy level structure within the nucleus. similar arguments were also given in @xcitethat, upon requiring that the recoiling nucleon sphere lies outside the fermi sphere. thus, the suppressed transitions should be controlled by the number of singlet spin states present in the nucleon system. additionally, we note that there is another effect due to the highly asymmetric structure of the hilbert space of two - nucleon pairs. this effect has not been fully investigated thus far. we summarize our results in a model independent way. besides, in order to check whether or not our conclusions hold for the nuclear matter we have to take into account other global effects, such as the parity - space correlation function and the relative entropy of entanglement. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm numerical simulations of nucleons at rest. 0.1 cm quantum statistics and multiparticle correlations faculdade de physique thorique ( talk presented at the ieee workshop on condensed matter, sesto pusteria, italy, july 12 - 14, 2004 ). the nucleonic sector is dominated by the phenomenon of quantum correlations. it is well known that there exist quantum effects that strongly influence the dynamics of the quantum chromodynamics. among them, the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) effect is due to correlations between the spins of two protons. the epr effect has been considered in the context of many - body systems such as superfluid helium where it is important
this paper presents a real - time modelling of an airborne wind energy system that uses a tether - discretised kite structure suspended in a stratified atmosphere. the kite is a two - line model, which allows to model the dynamics of the interaction between the wind during flight and the macroscopic environment, such as wind speed, wind speed at the end of the tether. the state vector of the system is constructed using discrete point masses connected by spring - damper elements. the tether and the driving force is represented as a point mass model. this approach has the advantage of using a coherent model structure for which efficient mathematical methods for solving the stiff equation system exist, while taking into account the aerodynamics of the wind profile. the previous studies used rigid tether segments for modelling the force control loop. on the other hand it was found that these models are not capable to simulate steady steady - state kite flight trajectories. in addition the tether model is not modelled at all, because it uses state space representations based on four dynamic states. this introduces discontinuities in the model which restrict the possible kite model use during flight. the focus of this paper is to present a model that is self - consistent for the modelling of a kite power system and of sufficient accuracy for the development of software that can be used for the loop testing of real kite pilots and deployable kite control systems. an improved one - point model is presented, that introduces the ability to change the angle of attack and the dynamics during simulation time using a drum - generator module. it can also account for tether deformation, deformation and air - wind drag. the model is solved using general purpose programming language that makes low - level optimizations possible. this work has been supported by a 2.5-year pilot qualification and the national research council ( nrc ) of the n.y. acad. of sci. usa ( gnss york i.v. ). @xmath0 -department of electrical engineering, university of edinburgh, mayfield road, edinburgh eh9 3jz, u.k.

quantum spin - hall ( qh ) systems are characterized by the topological number @xmath0 of electrons with up - spin or down - spin current@xcite. honeycomb lattices, in which the sublattice pseudo - inversion yields a spin - helical ground state with large spin - chern numbers, give a new kind of topological insulator. the dirac theory and the kubo formula have been used to obtain the numbers. however, so far no qh system has been prepared to date, and it is believed that exotic quantum phases may occur in such honeycomb systems. here we propose that a honeycomb system can be prepared to have arbitrarily high spin -chern numbers. we present two examples, silicene with ferromagnet order and tmois with zigzag edges, both in magnetic and electric field. the energy spectra of these systems are spin - polarized and contain many sub - landau levels, when applied in a magnetic field. it is found that the states at the fermi level are spin polarized and 2-fold degenerate with respect to the valley degree of freedom. they give rise to an interesting pattern of spin resolusion in the low magnetic field regime. quantum spin hall is one of the most fascinating concepts in physics found in this decadehasan, qi, tanaka, asakawa, hofstadter, and keiju, e.g., quantum magnetism is a research field that bridges the gap between quantum physics and materials science, because it is based on the quantum nature of the spin. the search for good qh systems is ongoing with the aim of achieving the knowledge of spin - transport properties in novel quantum materials. qh states can be obtained by measuring the spin on a micrometer scale and they are of great interest to the basic physics community. some of the best qh candidates are the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmoiss ), carbon - organic molecules such as carbon nanoribbon ( cnt ) and silicon carbide ( carbide ). the problem of observing qh quantum states in cnt quantum systems is still an open research program, that is, we have not succeeded in depositing a qh state on a substrate that is a non - magnetic order. on the other hand it is known that the edge states of such systems can be resolved by applying magnetic field in a perpendicular magnetic field, which makes them highly interesting to study. we have
this paper explores many of the possible numerical and physical mechanisms which may lead to the formation of an inner entropy core in galaxy cluster simulations performed with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code enzo. in particular, the role played by cold flows and large scale outflows in order to achieve high d / q in the region of cluster formation ; an effective ` ` dual energy formalism '' method was applied in the simulation study. the general picture resulting from the computation of gas tracers across the cluster frame was obtained : ( i ) an increase in the average gas entropy from @xmath0 at the initial conditions, ( ii ) a cooling flow which reconnects the cooling gas to the hot gas at the final state of formation, ( iii ) and the subsequent spreading of the entropy inside the cluster, ( iv ) and ( v ) non - gravitational heating mechanisms, responsible for the suppression of mixing in smoothed - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes, and for the increase of the mean entropy level within the cluster. the detailed analysis of the distribution of gas entropy in the simulated universe was performed in two parallel runs of the amr code. the first run analysed the evolution of the mass of the cluster simulated with nested grid methods, and the second one concentrated on the mass evolution of a local non - radiative galaxy cluster simulated using amr with a very quiet history and different cosmological parameters. the results show that the entropy distribution in the mode of gas cooling is different between sph and grid methods : it is well described by the pre - heating scenario, in which the gas is heated before it collapses, or by the ` ` uniform '' heating mechanism in the early universe, where initial conditions were very simple. in the latter case the gas entropy is raised by the energy released, out of the regions surrounding the growing super massive black hole. the end result of this work is an important conclusion, which opens the way for the realistic consideration of the interplays between physical and numerical effects in the description of the global baryonic properties of the universe. complementary results for a major merger cluster are reported.
we present the star formation rates, gas - phase oxygen abundances and dust absorption optical depths for a magnitude - limited sample of 705 galaxies drawn from the stromlo - apm ( sapm ) redshift survey. the galaxies in this sample have 60 and 100 @xmath0 m iras fluxes, and equivalent widths of,, and one or both of and are available. we compare the star - formation rates derived using standard estimators based on the, and far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities of the galaxies, as well as, and the absorption of ionizing photons by dust in regions and that by intervening stars. we find that, after correction for dust absorption, the standard estimator for gives a significantly higher star formation rate ( sfr ) than the derived sfr from other methods. the difference is primarily due to the treatment of dust absorption in the, which affects the best estimates of the sfr in optically thick models and is at the origin of the discrepancy between the sfrs derived using the fir and, and from other estimators. we then develop a dust model specific to the sapm galaxies to apply to our sample. in this model, the effective optical depths of dust in the galaxies are determined by the strength of the h@xmath1 and balmer emission lines. we apply the model to the sample of 149 non - seyfert galaxies with iras detections. we use the dust - free and dust - rich models to construct physically realistic models of the propagation of the photons emitted in star - forming galaxies through the interstellar medium and their absorption by dust. we show that these models are able to explain the observed ionized - gas properties of local galaxies. the estimated sfr of our sample is typically an order of magnitude higher than those derived using fir luminosity or absolute luminosity, even after the usual mean attenuation correction is applied to the data. the reason for this discrepancy is that the standard fir estimator neglects several important physical effects affecting the ionizing photon budget in galaxies, such as the contamination of emission by stellar absorption, which can lead to underestimates of the true rate of star formation in normal galaxies. with the help of the dust models developed by charlot & fall ( 2000 ), we now develop a method for estimating the ratios of the emergent ultraviolet ( emergent luminosity ) to the total sfr ( including contamination by dust ) in a self - consistent way. this method provides an excellent match to the observed ratios of fir lumin
we build an hess diagram for young, low - mass, young star clusters using a brute - force approach capable of fully exploring the parameter space parameter space, although using most of the sparse parameter space only. we apply this approach to recent hess photometry and simulations of young clusters, investigating the sensitivity of the inferred fundamental parameters ( age, mass, distance, reddening, etc ) to age, age, and differential reddening as well as to the presence of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars. using @xcite as a control case, we investigate the hess diagrams of bochum1, pismis5, and collinder197 in the context of @xmath0myr old clusters, finding the best set of values for the ` ` 2mass '' intrinsic colour magnitude relation. our method is applied to about 250 simulated clusters and is shown to provide significantly more accurate results than some of the previous approaches. in particular, it appears to be significantly more reliable than a previous hess method based on the near - infrared photometry, despite the fact that we use a solar - metallicity isochrone set and therefore a smaller number of stars than in some previous studies. we confirm the effectiveness of the approach by comparing with observations, although we point out that there are some limitations. for instance, the apparent distance modulus is overestimated by about a factor of 2 compared to the results obtained with artificial clusters. and, because of the pms stars in our simulations, the star - formation age spread is about twice that of previously studied clusters. interestingly, our approach is also shown to apply more consistently to clusters with a smaller age spread ( usually older than 20myr ), even though our simulations usually do not include age spread. taken together, our results indicate that our approach provides a more accurate distance estimate for young clusters than some previous methods. we discuss the consequences in terms of the residual statistics of this study.

we map out the energy levels and optical absorption spectra for parabolic quantum dots, containing up to four interacting electrons, in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and under the influence of an externally applied, perpendicular magnetic field. an accurate numerical scheme is developed to evaluate these quantities. the effects of so coupling on the single - electron spectra are primarily to lift the degeneracy at the spin @xmath0 of an electron confined in the dot. the effective zeeman interaction of the electron spin with the field lifts the spin degeneracy ( internal zeeman effect ). the magneto - optical transitions are shown to be sensitive to the so coupling and can, in principle, be used to control the spin dynamics in few - electron quantum dots. for the interacting many - electron systems we observed the appearence of discontinuities, anticrossings, and new optical modes that appear in conjunction with the two main absorption lines. these additional features arise entirely due to theso coupling and are a consequence of level crossings and level repulsions in the energy spectra. the accurate results for the low - lying energy levels for the so coupled quantum dots can also be measured,in principle, by transport or capacitance spectroscopy, which have been successfully employed earlier to mapout the energy spectrum of similar few - particle systems. the optical absorption spectrum for all types of quantum dots containing a few interacting electrons that are studied here shows a common feature : new modes appear, mostly near the upper main branch of the absorption lines around the 2 tesla that become stronger with increasing so coupling. among the three types of systems considered here, the optical signature of the so interaction is found to be the strongest in the absorption spectrum of a gaas quantum dot, but only at very large values of the magnetic field and so coupling strength. it is shown that increased so coupling makes the ground state of the dot to dipole - dipole transitions, and makes it possible to explore the dynamics of the quantum dot vertically, which would be essential for a future development of quantum computation and information processing. our results are a step forward in our quest for understanding the spin transport in quantum dots and to understand the underlying physics behind the generation of so - called majorana molecules.
we present the first co(j=3 - 2 ) maps of emission from the edge - on galaxy ngc 4631, part of the james clerk maxwell telescope nearby galaxies legacy survey ( ngls ) legacy survey. the prominent radio halo of this galaxy has a reported history of strong star formation activity which is superimposed on a multi - phase, gaseous halo with a thick diffuse molecular disk that shows evidence for ongoing star formation, indicating that the halo is enriched in molecular gas and dust. we present high - resolution ( @xmath0 ) maps, in the radio, ultraviolet ( uv ), optical, and near - infrared ( nir ) bands as well as in the central region of the molecular ring that show the presence of dust, molecular gas, and star formation. we find that the central molecular ring shows a clear rotating ring with scale lengths of 0.28 and 0.25 kpc, respectively, although the inner and outer ring scale lengths are 0.1 and 1.8 kpc for the nir and hi components, respectively. strong, broad emission is also detected from the central 0.3 - 1.2 kpc region. in the uv, we detect clumpy high - velocity clumps of co at 2.2 - 2.5 kpc away from the nucleus that are likely to be galactic outflows. we also detect anomalous velocity features at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.6 kpc above the plane in the optical, nir, hi, and nir bands. we examine the origin of these features and conclude that they are most likely to result from an interaction of a past outflow with a central nuclear starburst that left behind a thick disk. such an interaction could explain the m 82-like ` supershells'seen on the eastern side of the galaxy. however, time - dependent modelling of these outflows requires deeper and more extensive mapping of the magnetic field direction than is currently available. within the outflow radius, the molecular gas distribution is well modelled as a thin, thin disk with a gaussian density distribution starting at a radius of 1.7 kpc ( or 12.4 kpc ), which thins as it approaches the nucleus and extends further out to much larger disk radii ( or more than 6 kpc to the west ). thus, the observed thin distribution suggests that the outflowing material may have been excavated by a past starburst and/or
we prove that for any real - valued honeycomb in the number of boundary edges of the honeycomb with integer boundary values @xmath0 is an integer. in a similar vein to the saturation conjecture for hermitian manifolds, we show that this theorems also hold for ( nearly ) all _ non - degenerate _ honeycombs. this is a natural consequence of the fact that weyl s problem degenerates to schur s problem of dilating a single hexagon, and can thus be reduced to a purely honeycomb - theoretic problem. we give a natural example of a honeycomb which is not degenerate, but rather has regular largest lifts. it is a fundamental feature of the theory of open polyhedral cones that the lebesgue measure on the closed convex polyhedron is equivalent to the sum of the co - ordinate vectors of the incident rays multiplied by their tensions. this amounts to a geometric analogue of the littlewood - richardson rule for moment maps of compact lie groups. we also use this formalism to give a stronger result, which we will discuss in more detail, giving a necessary condition for the bi - stability of the quantum analogue. the classical saturation conjecture @xcite is a very useful geometric criterion for understanding the geometric structure of a complex vector space. given a random matrice with values in euclidean space, the saturated conjecture characterizes the topology of the space of polynomial time - independent random matrices whose solutions are found by applying the salvetti - rochester method to it. the original formulation of the conjecture was by j. d. weyl, who introduced the idea of a ` ` honeycomb '' ( or, more generally, of an integer lattice in the complex plane ). since the original conjecture was proved by p. haljan, r. h. souto ribeiro and j. p. torres, the results of which led to the development of the aforementioned saturation conjecture have remained one of the most important successes of geometric non - density theory. ( the satisfaction of which was, and, to a lesser extent, others. ) in the case of compact polyhedral lie groups, the most celebrated example is given by g. rademacher and c. zachos, which used the geometric theory of moment maps to obtain a saturation conjecture which has turned out to be the correct answer of the main problem of the problem. in this paper we shall be concerned with the special case in which the real
we present the results of a systematic analysis of the soft x - ray spectra of seven luminous supernova remnants in the lmc. the sample comprises seven middle - aged remnants ( n23, n49, n63a, dem71, n132d, 0453@xmath068.5, and n49b ), plus four less luminous ones, spanning a range of evolutionary states. the spectral data are described well by a nei model that includes the time evolution of density and temperature given by the sedov similarity solution for the dynamical evolution of snrs. this model was a better description of the data than any single or multiple component phenomenological nei models that we tried. the x - radiation data provide 4 independent constraints on the 3 independent parameters of the sedev model. these are : radius, shock temperature, emission measure, and ionization timescale. the observational constraints are : age, initial explosion energy, and ambient ism density. there is an additional ambiguity in the models that arises from the unknown relationship between the energy imparted to electrons and ions at the shock front. we model two extreme situations : full equilibration ( in which the electron and ion temperatures are assumed to be equal ) and coulomb equilibrence ( in where the electrons gain energy from the ions though coulomer collisions only ). the physical properties of the sample are fully consistent with sedov evolution in two ways. the first is independent and consistent with the assumption that the seven lmc snrs in our sample are all in the adiabatic phase of a supernova explosion within a preexisting cavity in the interstellar medium. the second is consistent with one of the more speculatively proposed scenarios that we uncovered in a recent study that the burst position is coincident with an unresolved source at the northern edge of n49. the three snrs that were not included in our study appear to be in the full accretion / shock phase of their supernova progenitors. based on our finding that the high - energy x - rays from their snrs are dominated by the swept - up interstellar ism rather than supernova ejecta, we favor an interpretation in which some of the sn ejecta have been contaminated with fresh material from the surrounding ism.
a century after their discovery, ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays remain one of the most intriguing questions in astrophysics. while modern experiments like the auger observatory ( auger ), hires and the telescope array ( ta ) can efficiently detect uhe neutrinos on earth, two complications remain that make it hard to identify their sources. first, the trajectories of crs are bent in the ( inter-)galactic magnetic fields, so the arrival directions of the crs at earth do not align with the positions of their sources, and therefore it is hard to distinguish their chemical composition. second, at higher energies events can not be found by studying the uhe crs directly. the detection of a low - frequency radio pulse on the moon provides constraints on the arrival direction of the neutrino. we are currently performing observations with the low frequency array ( lofar ), a new kind of radio telescope consisting of thousands of simple omni - directional antennas that takes advantage of recent developments in fast electronics. each antenna can synthesize a beam of 4-@xmath0 mhz single - frequency antennas. when a candidate pulse is found in one of them, candidate events can be localized to a few units per channel. this allows us to use the full resolution, full bandwidth raw time - series data of all antennas for offline analysis. presently, the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) is the only able to detect a few events above a threshold of 500 jy. in the next decade, we will extend our observations to the next generation of radio telescopes. we plan to observe uhe cosmic rays up to @xmath1 ev with hires and to search for isotropy in the radio pulse. the station beams are already being synthesized. we will also be able to measure the zero - point source flux at a few tenths of a tev with hires. the present limits on the flux of cosmic rays at earth are at least an order of magnitude lower than their astronomical detection limits. in order to improve the sensitivity of several experiments, like auger, ska and the pierre auger telescope array, we are also developing strategies to detect cosmic rays over a large range of energy.
this is the second of two companion papers on similarity solutions for the interior structure of spherically symmetric charged black holes accreting a pressureless fluid of neutral dark matter ( either massive or massless ) in addition to a relativistic fluid of charged baryons. the goal of that paper is to explore the idea of ` mass inflation ', the central issue of gravitational physics in the astrophysics of a black hole. in the first paper of this pair, the black hole is allowed to accrete a fluid of _ charged _ dark matter, which is pressureless andeless, with the dark matter particles either massless or massive @xmath0 solar masses, depending on whether the particle is massless ( as opposed to the usual massless scalar field ). in this paper we investigate self - similar black hole accretion scenarios for a charged black hole, in which the accretion is directed along the ecliptic coordinate, as suggested by a theory by poisson & israel ( 1990 ). here we consider a modified version of that theory, this time including the presence of outgoing and ingoing ( or ingoing and outgoing ) fluids as a key ingredient. we find that the black holes which accrete dark matter do and do not undergo mass inflation, as in the case of previous papers, are typically massive black holes, and their internal structure is remarkably similar to that of a baryonic black hole ; that is, their interiors are very nearly cauchy ( or singular ). while some dark matter may accrete more easily than others, most of the accreted dark matter is defensible, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments for which we have the flexibility to vary the parameters of the model and the cross - sections for absorbing and emitting gravitational waves, and it is likely that the central black hole has a very large misner - sharp mass. under such conditions, there is no inner horizon, and mass inflation becomes more extreme as one of the ingoing or outgoing streams is reduced to a trace relative to the other. as expected, mass inflation occurs as soon as the two streams become sufficiently close to each other near the inner horizon so that mass - inflation can take place. we also find, paradoxically, that it is precisely this scenario that sets the stage for mass inflation to occur.
we investigate the late - time evolution of magnetorotational turbulence in a global disk while its initial field configuration is varied. for cases where the disk begins with a large quantity of poloidal magnetic flux, we find that an isolated turbulent accretion disk evolves to a state that is identical, irrespective of the field configuration, as long as the vertical component of the magnetic pressure is constant during the duration of the simulation. hence, in these cases power can be effectively injected by vertical mri modes on large spatial scales, feeding the turbulent cascade from the top down. we concur with previous studies that the turbulent stress during the initial transient phase depends on the field topology, and the importance of the correlation between reynolds stresses with mean flow shear as an energy injection term. for the same reason, we show that a significant reduction in the stress level is expected for disks that are initialised with a toroidal field, in stark contrast to those that initially possess a poloidal field. there are results from global disk simulations with a mass source term, which facilitates simulations with long run times. all models show a decrease in the total disk mass during the transient evolution phase, followed by a flattening as the turbulent activity subsides and a balance is reached between rates of mass leaving and entering the disk via accretion and mass injection. we discuss the implications of these results for astrophysical disks, and some potential avenues for future studies. = -0.5 cm [ firstpage ] accretion, accretion disks magnetohydrodynamics methods : numerical
we present the results of an analysis of high dispersion spectra obtained with hires at the keck i telescope for a sample of 14 carbon stars selected from the hamburg / eso small magellanic cloud survey ( he s ). these observations are part of a large scale project to search for additional extremely metal poor main sequence stars in the halo of our galaxy. we estimate that the he s sample of 489 very metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath0 dex ) emp stars with moderate resolution spectra from the double spectrograph at the hale telescope should contain about 1670 such stars, of which at least 10 are c - enhanced. we establish that the c - star frequency among the most metal poor he s giants is @xmath16 %. including 10 additional c - stars with c - enhancement compiled from the literature, a total of 20 % of the palomar sample of c / vmp giants are found to be highly enhanced in the neutron - capture elements ba, y, la, ce, ni, and zr, compared to c. the percentage of c stars with ba enhancements is 6.4 %, and this fraction is essentially independent of fe - metallicity. enhancements of these heavy elements in c and ba are seen to be comparable to or higher than those of all other elements, suggesting that the nucleosynthesis of these elements is likely to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the enhanced abundances observed in these stars. we find a strong correlation between abundance of ba and [ c / fe ] at low metallicities, with c stars showing the highest values of the light elements, while c stars show the greatest enhancements of the heavy elements. we also present results for 10 candidate cataclysmic variables ( stars without yet identified ). the abundances and c - to - fe ratios of these 10 carbon stars suggest that at least half of them will be classified as c stars. using accurate ionization equilibrium measurements, we find that the fe - metallicities of the cooler, more metal poor stars ( log(fe : ba : fe ii ), with high c / c ratio and low n / c ) have been significantly underestimated by a factor of @xcite by the standard he s survey tools. this effect is largest for the cooler c stars ( n / ca ) with relatively high c to n ratio and high n to c ratio, possibly due to mixing and dredge - up of c - depleted material.
we present results from a spitzer survey of star formation and the interstellar medium in nearby tidal streams ( saints ), including 62 tidal star forming knots ( tsfks ). these were selected from an overlap region of three galaxies : ngc 5291, arp 242-n3, and stephan s quintet. the spitzer mid - infrared spectra show many of the features that would be expected for a disk galaxy, e.g., a strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ), warm h@xmath4, and a prominent bridge region. there are 18 rising, 12 declining, 9 flat, slowly rising, and 8 flat / slowly declining sed in the sample. the rising sed is typical of spiral and starburst galaxies with a dominant 40 @xmath5 60 k dust component and the declining sed probably indicates a dominant hot dust component. the pah - to - ionized ratio tends to increase in the blue band and the average ratio of pahs to ionized atoms increases from 4 to 11. the majority of the kiss dwarfs have 11 - 6 pah pahs in the [ ne.2emii ] line ratio indicating moderate excitation. the remaining half of the sample have less pah emission, and the ratios of pah ionized to neutral pahs tend to be flat or decreasing with increasing ionization. these results are used to address some key questions concerning star formation in tidal streams : does tsfk emission generally agree with star formation? if so, how does star formation contribute to the ism and gas in the tdgs? to what extent does the s - / m transition produce different spectra than spirals or dwarfs? our results also highlight the need for multi - wavelength imaging in the study of tidal streams and their implications for galaxy evolution.
we present a spectral monitoring of the unusual symbiotic binary star mwc560 in the period between october 1990 and february 1993. the observed spectrum is composed by a star of spectral class m45iii, a hot source, and a jet. the most spectral class of the giant star is m4. the object is known to have a very high velocity jet, with an opening angle of @xmath0, perpendicular to the line of sight. the jet is found to be inhomogeneous in both velocity and temperature. in the 3d and 4th seasons there is evidence for extra and variable radiation, whose radial velocity corresponds to the velocity of matter ejection in the jets measured from the absorption lines. because of the high velocity of the jets, there are indications that their axis is parallel to the axis of accreted matter. we interpret that the jets are produced when the mass accretion from the wind of the red giant is carried away by the matter coming from the accretion disk. the parameters of the hot component and the jet are determined. the existence of a flare ( increase in velocity and increase in temperature ) of the 3rd season emission lines of hi and feii allows us to estimate the amount of matter that has been ejected in the jet. we assume that the outburst is caused by a change in the magnetic field of the white dwarf and that the final possible state of the evolution of the system is the state in which the giant has filled its critical lobe. we also present a photometric flickering, a typical feature of all cataclysmic variables in which gas accretion by a white dwarf with a magnetic field occurs. the flickering is an evidence of the non - uniform distribution of the gas as a function of time. despite the flickering, the intrinsic brightness and the spectrum of the object are the same, suggesting that the same physical processes are responsible of the variability of the emission lines.

we analyze the emergence of space - time from the homogeneous topology of a @xmath0-dimensional causal network. in this approach, we use the einstein protocol to construct the coordinated system of events in the network, along with the relative coordinate systems between any couple of boosted frames. upon considering the causal connections as exchanges of classical information, we can establish coordinate systems via an einsteinian protocol, leading to a digital version of the lorentz transformations. in a computational analogy first noticed by leslie lamport, the foliation construction can be regarded as the synchronization protocol with a global clock of the calls to independent subroutines ( the causally independent events ) in a parallel distributed computation. we show how the synchronisation of the events is broken due to an in - principle indistinguishability between neighboring events, resulting in a network that is coarse - grained, the thickness of the event being a function of the observer s clock. the digital - analog conversion is thus just a rescaling of both space and time coordinates by the factor of 2, with the maximal speed given by the weyl - tiling problem. this error is cured if the causal network is quantum, as e.g. in a quantum cellular automaton. the rate of re - establishing links is then the same as the real rate of light - travel - time, and the isotropy of the network is recovered with a superposition of causal paths. we thus argue that our study represents a first attempt to address the crucial problems of the quantum version of time - time emergence. * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * desy 03 - 049 march 2002 @xfig.tex * time - machines : the engine of quantum gravity * * naively designed quantum computers * * s. j. s. fonseca@xmath1, j. a. prez - hernndez@xcite and h. ritsch - martin@xb @xcite * * quantum gravity as a physical mechanism of emergence from purely causal topologies * * w. l. tic - tacs * * and * * a. beveratos * * 0.1 in * * pacs numbers : 03.65.+v *
we investigate whether inhomogeneous azimuthal distributions of asymptotic gian branch ( agb ) stars ( ` ` stellar clumps '' ) in the present galaxies can probe the past clumpy stellar distributions of the galaxies several gyr ago. using test - particle simulations, we investigate how unbound groups of agb stars ( _ stellar clump _ ) can be dispersed into interstellar spaces in galaxies and thereby try to understand how long such inhomogeneities, initially formed in the early universe, remain gravitationally bound and survive after the dispersal of the clumps. we mainly investigate multiple clump models in which the initial inhomogeneity of the stellar distribution is determined only by the gravitational fields of their host galaxies for @xmath0 gyr. we find that in the standard model ( i1 ), the initial compact distribution of a clump ( which is assumed to be a two - component stellar distribution in the clump model ) is transformed into a crescent - shaped one ( i.e., noguchi 1998 ) through phase mixing of the stars. as dynamical evolution proceeds, the compilations of stars in more massive clumps become more and more round and eventually phase - mixed due to the more efficient phase mixing in disk galaxies. since the average clump has a given characteristic radius ( at a given distance from the galaxy center ) and mass ( given by the characteristic luminosity function ) at the epoch of homogeneously distributed clumps, the resulting clump - cluster size function should be homogeneous at least for a given clump mass. in the models with less massive stellar clusters, the populations of stars initially located within them can more quickly disappear owing to the phase mixing, thus, providing a probe to probe the clumpy pasts of the host galaxies. the results do not depend strongly on the initial properties of stellar clules ( e.g., mass, size, and orbit ). these results imply that field stars with a given age and metallicity in the lmc have fossil information of different clumps formed several gyrs ago. we construct models with parameters consistent with physical properties of the las campanas cluster ( lmc ) to compare the results with observations for the lca, and find good agreement between our results and those of the smc. we finally show that the temporal evolution of the spatial distributions of stars due to dispersal / accretion of clumps can be probed by studies of field stars for different ages and metallicities in
we perform radiative transfer calculations to study the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of class 0 sources in the taurus - auriga and ophiuchus star - forming regions. our models consist of a central stellar source surrounded by a infall region of a low - mass, thermally - supported molecular cloud core. the infall rate is set by the properties of the cloud envelope, which consists of @xmath0 dust particles and the circumstellar material surrounding the central source. we find that the standard model of protostellar collapse, in which infall is described by a pressure - supported singular cloud sphere with a density of about 2@xmath1k, correctly describes the seds of this new class of sources. however, because of the large mass of the central star and the rapid infall rate of the infall region, the total fraction of material accumulated by the cloud is likely to be much higher ( by orders of magnitude ) than the typical value for class i sources. we show this by constructing a grid of infall models with a wide range of envelope densities for source luminosities. the densities are required to fit the observed radial intensity profiles of the prototype class 0 source vla 1623 in the low - luminosity source iram 04191 + 1522 in the orion b molecular cloud. with a standard radius of 460 pc and an optical depth of 25.5 mag, the luminosity of this source is equivalent to its bolometric luminosity, so it is a very bright source of millimeter emission. we also show that the presence of a molecular outflow is not necessarily ruled out in the models. in fact, we show that a large fraction of the observed luminous dust sources in taurus can be explained with high infall rates ( by about a factor of 5 ). we argue that the very high accretion rates found for ` ` class 0 '' sources can result from the high densities of their initial cloud cores rather than from always being the very first phases of collapse. we discuss the implications of our results for the formation and evolution of young stellar objects ( ysos ).
we present the results of new 022 ( 81-pc ) resolution, merlin 1.4-ghz absorption observations of the central @xmath0900 pc of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) arp 220. the observations were obtained in the bands of the neutral hydrogen ( ),, and. the line - of - sight velocity distribution is shown for the first time in these observations, and confirms that the western disk is orbiting in the plane of the large - scale co disk, contrary to previous assumptions. under the assumption that the eastern nucleus is the retrograde nucleus of the merger, the mass derived from the molecular gas is 1.3@xmath1(310@xifiktarithmically - rotating-disk models are consistent with the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the central 900 pc of arp 200 and implies that the merger was prograde - retrograde and occurred at a time significantly earlier than in the typical interaction between gas - rich disk galaxies in ulirgs. the velocity field of the main kinematic component is modelled from multi - component gaussian profile observations made at 5 ghz. there is a clear offset between the positions of the radio supernovae and oh megamaser emission features in the spectra of the western nucleus, particularly for the location of the higher - density oh component. the position of the well - known western radio continuum peak, i.e., is approximately perpendicular to the line of sight, but is aligned with the major axis of the writhing molecular gas disk. this suggests that the source of the pumping photons is the intense starburst occuring in the wright - centric western disk and therefore belongs to the system. the derived masses are about a factor of ten below the values implied by the previous molecular gas observations, although given the uncertainty in the co mass determination they are likely to be several times lower than the values derived from previous observations. the lack of an absorption signature from the eastern - disk gas indicates that its western disk lies above the eastern disk and is on its final inward journey towards merging with the main disk. the presence of disturbed in the bridge ( b ) connecting the two nuclei further supports this merger scenario ; the proposed scenario of an inner - cut - off region of gas in the very final stage of merging is consistent with our results.
using high resolution, high s / n keck i spectra, we have investigated the metal contents of clouds at @xmath0. using a composite spectrum analysis that includes all known absorption line systems in the clouds, we deduce a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath1 2. this is in stark contrast to the results of numerical simulations in which a significant fraction of clouds show absorption individually ( _ e.g., _ ). the difference between the systems with and without absorption is due to the larger filling factor of voids located between collapsed objects than between these two types of clouds. for clouds with we find that their [c / h ] distribution is characterized by a near - universal c iv / h i distribution ( _ i.e. _, with the c iv ratio at the peak of the distribution ). thus, the clouds have been enriched in heavy elements. if the clouds are photoionized by the integrated light from quasars, they can be produced by collisional ionization but under non - equilibrium conditions. the clouds with show absorption are preferentially located in the filamentary gaseous regions surrounding and connecting collapsed objects, in contrast to clouds with no absorption in either system or in the voids. if we assume that clouds are solely enriched by ejection of metal - enriched gas from supernova, we can set a conservative upper limit on the maximum distance this enriched gas could have traveled by the time this material is turned into stars. the very low metallicities we infer for the clouds rules out the suggestion that a generation of population iii ( pop iii ) stars polluted the entire universe to a nearly uniform level of[ c or h]0. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3.#1#20 # 1eq.

we report on a density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) study of the nearest - neighbor spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice in a plane of uniform applied magnetic field. we find a complex phase diagram, with a transition between coplanar and cone phases, and a commensurate incommensurate transition in the high field region. we use an analytic solution of the bethe - salpeter equation to determine the phase boundaries in the model, and in particular we find that the ground state of the model is characterized by the well - known isotropic line below the saturation of the magnetization, known as the 1/3 plateau ". we extend our previous two - dimensional study by carrying out a dynamical mean field analysis in one dimension to two dimensions and accounting for one - dimensional quantum effects, using a technique which is much easier to implement in a three - dimensional system. we compare the results with semi - classical results and find that most of the observed phase diagrams can be fairly well reproduced by a model in which spins are described as o(3 ) vectors, the spin density wave ( sdw ) state with classical excitations. we map out the phase diagram for the system in terms of the ratio of the ground - state energy to the strength of the short - range spiral magnetically ordered order parameter, @xmath0, and provide a useful analytic fit to it. at zero field, we observe a spontaneously dimerized, ground state. the entanglement entropy of this state is of order unity, and it is energetically favorable for interactions via spin - coupling to the central finite - size eigenstates of the quantum hamiltonian. we also study the regime of weakly coupled ( weak - coupled ) one dimensional chains, and find a pronounced oscillatory behavior along the chain lines, which can be interpreted as a deformation of the sdw state with spins ordering into low - energy states. this is interpreted as an effect of the introduction of spatial anisotropy into the exchange interactions, and we argue that it can be understood as a saturation point of the spin - density - wave state, somewhat analogous to the haldane gap seen in integer spin chains with collinear classical states. the results are also consistent with the existence of a plateau, and suggest that this plateau persists even in the region of small magnetization where weak quantum fluctuations are important, perhaps as a consequence of the absence of a true
we determine the future dynamical evolution of the m31 - m31 system using @xmath0-body simulations, and use semi - analytic orbit integrations to assess the variation in outcomes allowed by the observational uncertainties. this is the first study of this topic based on fully observationally constrained initial conditions. we find that, as noted in previous studies, the velocity vector of m31 is statistically consistent with a radial ( head - on collision ) orbit towards the milky way ( mw ). the mw and m31 masses used in these calculations are not fully consistent with the currently available observational constraints, and we do not include the effects of the lmc and smc, the next two most massive galaxies in the lg. based on the latest observational and theoretical insights into the masses and mass distributions of the galaxies, we determine the first pericenter distance from now, which is a first attempt to break the degeneracy between total mass and orbital angular momentum of this very large group of galaxies. the new orbit results in 17.3 % of the monte - carlo orbits m31 has a direct hit with the m30 when it goes through the orbit ; this means that the m33-m31 system is less tightly bound than previously thought. the simulation results also hint at a variety of different orbits for m33. there are : 1 ) orbits with smaller than - average relative velocities, such that the velocity of m33 is larger than average. 2 ) orbits in which the relative velocity is significantly larger than the typical velocity of the sun. these orbits are most likely midway in the allowed parameter range of this study. 3 ) orbits that have a steep velocity gradient in the galactocentric rest frame. the most important result from this study is that the canonical m31-m33 model produces an orbit of generic kind. the initial conditions for this model are similar to the canonical ` ` hernquist model '' of e.g., m32. we discuss in detail the orbital evolution and effects of ` ` galaxy distortions '' in this model, as well as the resulting orbital quantities. future work will provide much stronger constraints on the actual physical characteristics of mergers of luminous spiral galaxies.
we here present preliminary results on the behavior of the x - ray burster 4u1636@xmath0536 during and around the 2001 superburst, which occurred on 2001 feb 22. a superburst of this type was also seen in public earlier by the rxte / asm on june 19, 1996, but this event was not included in our previous analysis. in the present work we focussed on the light curves acquired during and after the superburst which cover the rise and decay period of this source. we found that, as in previous observations, the light curve of 4u 1636 -0536 shows an exponential decay followed by a fast rise. the average ( before and after ) peak flux reached by the end of 2001 is about 50 % higher than that reached during a precursor burst a factor of @xmath14.7 yrs earlier. furthermore, the decay of the ( pre - superburst ) light curve reaches a rate of about 6 per day at 1250hz. this is higher than, but consistent with, the average rate of 5 per day found from an analysis of the bepposax / wfc light curve obtained during the previous ( 2000 ) superburst. we show that the ( net ) supernova light curve can be described by a schechter function with a power - law amplitude of + 0.65@xsmath2ergs and a photon index of -0.44. the integrated light ( for 1-day average exposure ) is shown to be similar to that obtained during normal x - rays bursts. we also present the results of the search for the signal associated with the binary companion xte j1636 - 036. no firm evidence is found for the detection of a signal at the observed frequency corresponding to the ` ` banana branch '' of the color - color diagram. however, we do find a hint of a quasi - periodic oscillation ( at 1150hz ) at that same frequency. the high - timing data show the same trend as our data, i.e., the fast rise followed by an exponential - like decay, as well as the fast hardening during the ( subsequent ) decay.
we present preliminary results on the selection of weakly interacting neutrinos in @xmath0 scattering. this analysis is performed within the framework of the geant4-based simulation of the miniboone experiment. the distributions of neutrino energy and momentum in the scintillator and minos near detector are compared to the results from the simulation. the preliminary results are shown to be in good agreement with our simulation. in the future, we plan to present several statistical aspects of this analysis, including the choice of the recoil energy, how the energy deposit away from the track is distributed in the detector and how the detector systematics depend on the background events. these characteristics will allow us to make informed decisions regarding the future evolution of this experiment. = 1 pacs number(s ) : 13.75.gv, 14.40.gx, 13.80.hq + + e. goudzov@xmath1, n. kazartsev komatsu institute for nuclear research, utias, israel, e - mail : nk@utia.ac.il + + g. d. jones@rsl.gov, k. l. masters + school of physics and astronomy, university of edinburgh, jcmb king s buildings, mayfield road, edinburgh eh9 3jz, scotland, england _ + r. ammar, p. baringer, d. besson, s. blatt, m. bogusz, l. boldizsar, a. bravar, and j. balonik + dipartimento di fisica, universit di padova, vicolo dellosservatorio 5, 35122 padua, italy _ + s. bussino, f. marrucci, g. m. messin + _ cern, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + m. mosca, j. p. torres, r. s. windeler, and h. weinfurter + department of physics, pennsylvania state university, university park, pa 16802, usa _
we investigate the kinetics of heat transport through three - dimensional nanolayer systems after ultrafast laser heating with a laser fluence. within the time resolution of @xmath0ps, we show that the energy density of the y layer in paramagnetic dy compounds increases monotonically with temperature. this is exemplified by the experimentally determined energy densities, as well as the tensor strain and the transient strain, which show no indication of thermal excitation in the y layers. these results are interpreted and explained by the concept of energy dissipation channel, due to the additional dissipation of energy into spin excitations in the antiferromagnetic spin system. in addition, we demonstrate that the heat transport is accelerated by the phonons in the spin- and phonon - system of dy, leading to a lattice contraction that gives rise to a significant increase of the lattice strain. we develop a model to describe the collective behavior of the heat across the layers and find excellent agreement of the measured strain with the theoretical strain calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. the collective dynamics of sound propagation in solids is particularly relevant for condensed matter systems, since it has been shown to speed up sound propagation over timescales much smaller than the time for sound to propagate through the in - plane length scale given by the laser - excitation spot size. sound propagation has a special place in our understanding of superconductivity, because it relies on the non - equilibrium dynamics of the quasiparticles @xcite. ultracold atom systems are particularly interesting to study because, in addition to the direct electrical and optical resistivity, sound is a potentially important carrier of energy. recently, a number of studies have focused on the coupling of heat to different nanolayers of y, nb or dy. for example, recent experiments on dy have demonstrated that the magnetization of its low - loss y layer is very sensitive to the temperature, while optical measurements have indicated that it is very insensitive to low temperature. however, despite these sophisticated experimental and theoretical studies, it is still unclear how much heat is actually carried by electrons and phonons and how much is actually transported by phonons. heat transport across the interface of y and dy has recently been studied by using an ellipsometric technique, which allows for the direct measurement of the temperature variation of the energy in individual thin film layers [ fig. [ fig : uxrddata]a ). in this work we directly derive the temperature - dependent energy density, by ellipsometry
we present deep cycle 7 wfpc2 images of the dwarf irregular galaxy sextans a. we find that the most recent ( @xmath0 myr ) star formation episode occurred 4.8 gyr ago, and that there has been star formation active region in the lower part of the galaxy for at least 200 myr. we estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) from the blue he burning ( bheb ) stars and the red clump stars using the main sequence ( ms ) luminosity function. the photometric data are in very good agreement with previous observations of a similar field in the same galaxy, and we have nearly complete coverage of the optically visible portion of this galaxy. the cmd from the new observations is nearly 2 magnitudes deeper than the one from cycle 5. this allows an unambiguous separation of the faint ms stars from contaminants. the ms stars appear to be centrally concentrated, and there is no strong evidence for them in the f555w / f814w color - magnitude diagrams. also apparent is a large population of blue he - burning stars which are associated with the highest column density gas structure in the galaxy. however, we find two significant deviations from a steady state of steady star formation activity that is consistent with a stochastic star formation model. the eastern portion of the disk contains a star formation region that has been active at least over the past 500 myr, while no star formation has been observed in the western region. the central region contains two galaxies that have sfr values that are very similar to other di galaxies. we suggest that these two galaxies may be twins : one has been forming stars for the past 400 myr while the other is in an unusual state. finally, we compare the locations of the recent sfr changes in the two star formation regions. the increased sfr in the east is nearly identical to the pattern seen in the central 2 - 3 gyr. this suggests that the formation has not been affected by the merger history of the universe.
we present a simple model of the evolution of gas - rich disk galaxies in the ` ` cold cloud '' phase. we consider a continuous range of temperatures in the cold neutral medium ( wnm ), including the so - called ` ` two phases '' of the interstellar medium ( ism ), and assume hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction. the model is solved for a large number of parameters, and we show that the results capture the major physical features of the disks : the self - regulated heating and cooling processes in the whm, the adiabatic cooling of high pressure gas elements, the radiative cooling in the mean wnm with a rate proportional to the gas density squared, and the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) star formation law. inevitably, there are many uncertainties in the couplings between the individual gas components. moreover, the model does not include the turbulent stresses in the intercloud medium, which we feel are essential to an understanding of the large - scale structure. one result of this model is that the tully - fisher relation between maximum circular velocities and the total luminosities of disk galaxies is nearly universal, and that this relation is reasonably well described by a simple version of the model described by broecker et al. ( 1997 ). other recent results of the field, like the suggestion by dopita ( 1985 ) that the @xmath0version of the conductive gas in large late - type disks may be a consequence of local self - regulation, and a connection to the formation of massive star clusters, are also discussed. we conclude that the model provides a useful framework for understanding the complex gas dynamics and star formation processes at both large and small scales in galaxies. # 1#2 [ firstpage ] galaxies : halos galaxies : kinematics and dynamics galaxies : structure hydrodynamics
we present a theoretical analysis of the _ swift _ bat and xrt observations of grb 060218. this source has been discovered at a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath0 and is characterized by an x - ray light curve with a long, slow rise and gradual decline corresponding to the onset of the afterglow phase. it has also an unusual optical luminosity, dominated by the sn2006aj emission. in our theoretical approach we assume that all grbs, short or long, originate from the gravitational collapse to a black hole and that the grb process is a part of the core collapse supernova. we present a consistent approach to represent the entire dynamical evolution of the fireshell, within a consistent theoretical framework. we identify two free parameters describing the long duration grb, i.e. the total energy of the plasma and the ratio between the effective emitting area and the total area of the pulse. we show that each of these parameters, together with the baryon loading parameter, naturally explains the consistency of the observed data and characterizes the behavior of this source up to very late time. in particular, the theoretical fit of the xrt data implies that the rapid decrease of the luminosity during the prompt emission is due to the transition from the circumburst medium ( cbm ) to the firehell and the rapid increase of the effective particle number density, which both increase the mean effective cooling rate during the entire grb time and consequently the duration of the gamma peak. moreover, the transition to the supernova phase is a diagnostic of the value of the energy used in the fitting. in order to fit the data we have to choose the energy chosen is too small to fit all the data points in the entire energy range accessible to the current data. so we put the parameterism of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) into context with the present theoretical approach and propose a new, ` ` canonical '' grb - black hole formation scenario. gamma rays : bursts - ism : jets and outflows - radiation mechanisms : non - thermal - shock waves
we present measurements of the variations in the luminosity function of galaxies associated with clusters of galaxies in numerical simulations with semi - analytic galaxies. we start by characterising the density at which a galaxy resides by locating the dark - matter halo that is closest to the galaxy position in units of halo / group radius, denoted by @xmath0. we take into account the different halo sizes in order to estimate the normalised distance to the group from each simulation halo, and also the effects of tidal stripping of mass from normal haloes. after showing that the simulated galaxy luminosity functions can be described by a schechter function, we proceed to use this method to study the real 2dfgrs and 2pigg catalogues. we find significant variations in both the mass function of haloes within groups, and that around simulated groups low mass haloes are typically more concentrated than their high mass counterparts. we also find that the characteristic luminosity of galaxies lying within a given range of normalised distances to halo centres is almost insensitive to the halo mass, while the same holds for galaxies at larger distances. these results provide strong support for the claim that clusters are capable of cannibalising haloes from nearby regions, by properly taking into account observational biases. we show that the star formation rate around haloes of different mass is independent of the environment in which they reside, so that the well known finger - of - god effect is not present around groups. finally, we study the effect that the colour index of galaxies observed in redshift surveys on our measurements. when no corrections for the observational effect are attempted, we find that intrinsic biases are quickly erased by the derived mass function variations, even if we include local density. this demonstrates the possibility of using redshift data from galaxy surveys to accurately determine the local mass function.

we review various issues concerning the theory and experimental analysis of @xmath0-electron compounds such as octupole ordering, magnetism and superconductivity, after applying the orbital degenerate model on the basis of the putga@xmath1 coupling scheme. after defining the model hamiltonian, we review possible orbital ordering of 115 compounds, for instance, ruthenates and nickelates, by using numerical calculations as well as theoretical results on other compounds. most of the discussion has centered on the a - type magneto - resistance ( cmr ) phenomena in manganites so far, but a recent trend is to unveil novel phases in other transition metal oxides. in order to understand the novel phases emerging from the competition among spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom, it is essential to develop a unified microscopic picture for the orbital ordering in these compounds. in this framework, the terms ` ` spin '' and ` ` orbital '' are essential ingredients to describe the different possible phases. after the description of the manganite ground - state, we proceed to discuss the non - bravais lattice such as the honeycomb lattice, but excluding the effect of oxygen in the model. we find that the appearance of a new phase in the high - temperature region is not surprising, since the curie - weiss magnetic susceptibility of the material stays practically the same in this temperature range. we also review the features of the orbital ordered phase in non - cuprates and rare - earth alloys. finally, we move on to the construction of ( iii ) microscopic models for non - baas / ceas systems, which are the kind of spin - charge - orbital complexes in which the hund s rule interaction plays an important role in understanding the complex behavior. then, we briefly review the all - american results on ce-115 compounds to get a insight into the nature of new phases that can be found in this class of compounds.
we present hst imaging of four different environments in the local group galaxy ngc6822, with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _, to study the properties of its massive star population. the ` ` group 1 '' fields, located @xmath0 2.5 kpc off ( north of ) the galaxy center, include the ob15 association, the hii region hubble v, the best known ob8 association, as well as several other associations, all of which are part of the group of sixteen ob associations previously catalogued by kayser ( 1967 ). the general field contains only a small number of hot massive stars, comparable to the expected number of foreground stars. we found twenty - five a - type supergiant candidates in the group 1 fields outside of the ob 15 association. assuming that the imf does not vary, the ratio of hot stars density among the two regions is 0.7 /arcmin@xmath13. the total mass of the clusters that we derived from our photometry in five bands, including nuv and fuv, corresponds to a density of 80 - 200 hot stars / arcmin=13.0 % of the total stellar mass. we use the reddening free indexes in the five bands to construct reddening maps and absolute luminosity maps, and use them to derive physical parameters of the stars. the derived physical parameters include ( among other things ) the stellar initial mass function ( imf, mass, metallicity, and reddening ). we find that the current mw stellar mass function is a factor 8 lower than that of the galactic field star counts. we compare our observations with the predictions of ratnatunga & bachall ( 1985 ), making comparisons with their model colors. another indication of the recent star formation history is the _ low _ mass fractions of young massive stars in ob15 and ob8, which are consistent with the ages of these associations as indicated by hrds. we conclude that star formation in ngc 6822 has been active over the past few million years.

the degree distribution is perhaps the most widely used quantity in complex networks, due to its relevance in numerous spheres of science and society. in this article, i focus on the relative degree distribution of nodes in networks of rank @xmath0 ( i.e., random hypergraphs ), and derive several identities for it. to address the neighbor distribution of the projected graphs onto them, i introduce the notion of hypergraph projection, useful here as a tool to calculate neighbor distribution. i show that it is possible to compute neighbor distribution for all hypergraph densities by using the same sub - index as in the case of bipartite networks. a new quantity, called enumerative number of nodes, emerges in this context as well : the number of neighbors shared by multiple nodes or by multiple overlapping nodes when one node is connected to another node in the projected graph. this quantity is new and interesting, and provides an alternative to the degree distribution that is widely used in the study of networks. i develop a new algorithm to calculate it, and apply it to a simple network in the sparse limit. a number of identities are derived for it, which are useful in analyzing large datasets. _ this article is dedicated to george sperling whose curious, incisive mind rarely fails to produce the unexpected creative idea. george and i have been colleagues for the longest time in both of our careers. the benefit has been mine. learning how to code quickly has opened new avenues of research in the area of geometrical data and information technology. the development of these new techniques has also motivated a wealth of new systems in social, technological, and natural systems over the last decade. the exploration of these systems has been quite impressive ; a testament to the breadth and depth of my experience in this field can be found in any research field. however, much of what i have accomplished in this area has been done within the confines of the statistics and statistics communities, and my knowledge of the subject is still very limited. the goals of this article are to provide a general approach to the analysis of the statistical properties of graphs or ensembles of graphs in the context of _ complex networks _ and to develop understanding of its application and applications.
in this paper we present exact results for the self - energy @xmath0 of systems of fermions interacting through anisotropic anisotropy and with arbitrary range of interaction potentials ( through the luttinger theorem ) in the high - density limit, as obtained for the case of the single - band hubbard hamiltonian. in this regime, the normal states of the fermi sea of interacting metallic particles of opposite spin on the same lattice site are special in that, through the periodicity over the 1bz of the reciprocal space of the interaction, it takes on some limiting properties as related to the sufficiency of the bcs occupation fraction in the underdoped regime. as a consequence, the pseudogap phenomenon, i.e. the heterogeneous distribution of the charge and spin states with respect to the underlying bravais lattice, is not excluded, even in cases where the interaction is _ not _ operative amongst particles with opposite spins on opposite lattice sites. we explicitly identify this region of the phase diagram as the _ non - contact - type _ interaction, through an application of the monte carlo method to two - body potentials for the interacting metallic gs and through a comparison with available experimental data concerning the variation of the angle - resolved photoemission data in the uniform and isotropic regimes of the cuprate compounds. we also briefly consider generalizations of our results to correlated fermion systems, specifically through the use of the kramers - krnig relations, providing for the first time exact expressions for the exchange and correlation potentials of such systems. our results are in good agreement with those deduced from the consideration of uniform metallic self - energies in the weak - coupling limit and from the quasiparticle excitation spectrum, for both interacting and non - interacting systems. as an application, we also discuss the significance of a simple model for the mott - hubbard gap in the case, in which only local ` repulsive'interactions are taken into account, and of an _ indirect _ gap as played by a variety of ` extended'hubbard ( and associated extended hamiltonians ) models.
nasa has recently announced the discovery of the first earth trojan, 2010 tk@xmath0, and the first known asteroid, 2010 horseshoe, in a survey that uncovered @xmath16,000 near - earth objects ( neos ). with the success of this initial survey comes the promise of a new era in neo research. the potential for detecting hundreds of such objects makes these objects potentially dangerous to future human and robotic missions. the need for detecting and characterizing potentially hazardous neos is growing rapidly, with approximately 10,000 - 20,000 objects now known with well - determined orbits and physical properties. to prepare for this new class of objects, our group conducted a simulation of a survey observing a * limited region of sky * with wise over two years to test the sensitivity and reproducibility of the wide - area infrared space observatory ( wise ) space telescope as well as the venus - trailing and l1 surveys. the limited region simulation used wise s modified moving object processing system ( wmops ) system to link detections together. the all - sky survey was conducted using the standard, existing technology for real - time linking provided by the large aperture camera ( l1 ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. the preliminary results indicate that even with wise s small area infrared sensitive primary mirror, it will be possible to successfully find a majority of the neos found by conducting a survey from l1 and l2, even with next - generation detectors such as the hgcdte. the performance of the instruments in the two - micron all sky survey will be of paramount importance for a precise extraction of faint sources from the survey data. we have developed a set of simulations that demonstrate the capability of detecting sources down to signal - to - noise ( snr ) of 4.5 with extremely high reliability and completeness. similar science data processing techniques are expected to be used for neocam. if approved for execution in the near future, this study paves the way for a new generation of near earth object ( neo ) surveys with the significant benefit of increased sensitivity, completeness, and reliability.
we show that quantum teleportation, unlike classical communication, is not a facsimile process. rather, we show that during a teleportation, the initial quantum state is destroyed ( maximally mixed ), so that at the end we are left with no copies of the state with which we started. only the teleported state remains, and this will have been transferred across to the recipient particle where it will now reside. since there is no _ copy _ of the initial state, we do not lose track of the exponential increase in the number of terms in the amplitude prefactors required to complete the teleportation. we then give the complete expressions for the transmittivity required to generate a bell - state in a teleportation of an arbitrary - dimensional pure state, such as a qutrit. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 e. knill, r. laflamme, and g. j. milburn, ` ` a scheme for efficient transfer of quantum information via atomic ensembles, '' phys. rev. * 112 *, 19181939 ( 1993 ). + h. p. vogels, a. a. malygin, and a. n. agrawal, _ quantum computation and quantum information _, ( cambridge university press, 2000 ). n. gisin, g. ribordy, w. tittel, m. halder, o. algora, and h. zbinden, _ the quantum information conference _ ( wiley - interscience, cambridge, 2011 ). w. c. helwig, j. i. rosen - podolsky, p. m. lezec, and r. s. nagpure states are of paramount importance in our efforts to understand the superposition principle, and to retrieve quantum information transfer. we are solely interested in systems that can be teleported with a high efficiency, and we will be grateful if the regime of quantum teleportation can be extended to include even the case of highly entangled states. maximally entangled states offer a fundamentally new method of transferring quantum information between two particles separated by an arbitrary distance, currently over 140 km in free space. + + our study of teleportation is motivated by the famous no - cloning theorem in quantum mechanics, which states that no quantum state can be transferred from one particle to another without a replication of it. for this reason, we focus on dynamics that only rely on the destruction of the original state, and on the

we investigate the physical parameters of 12@xmath0 m - selected galaxies in the local universe using a large sample of star forming galaxies and agn with available redshifts and emission line measurements from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). this sample enables us to investigate with high statistical significance how stellar mass, metallicity, redshift and star formation rate ( sfr ) compare with purely optically selected samples. we find that the sfr and stellar mass are tightly correlated, with low and high sfr corresponding to different dominant stellar populations, and with ir luminosity being a useful proxy for the amount of star formation activity. the agn are typically an intermediate mass between the main sequence of sf galaxies and quiescent agn. the mid - ir ( 4.612 - 0.0 m ) sfr estimates are in good agreement with iras - based sfrs, but we find a strong dependence of @xmath1 on it, suggesting that intense star formation is regulated by the stellar population rather than the other way around. we characterize the galaxy populations using stellar masses, luminosities and sfr, and investigate how agn activity correlates with these parameters. we also test for systematic effects that could bias the best sfr indicator considering the presence of an agn, and find that stellar mass is not a good indicator for either ` ` old '' or ` ` young '' stars in the bpt diagram. rather, it is a reliable indicator for any evolution indicator, but again there is a dependence on stellar mass that could mask the source of ir emission. we illustrate our results with a sample of 8 uv / optical selected galaxies, spanning from low - ir to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies, for which high quality optical spectra and dust - corrected sfr are available. we conclude that the bulk of the infrared emission in these objects traces the star formation sequence, with a clear preference for blue nuclei over red ones, at least for the _ strong _ agn population, which ranges from a few tens of myr old objects to a few hundred gyr old objects.
we develop an evolutionary game theory framework to investigate the interactions between automatic and controlled processing in a large class of human systems. we model a world in which agents forage for resources, compete for access to them, and choose how to consume goods they acquire to generate fitness, with fitness being subject to diminishing marginal returns on consumption. agents are then subject to natural selection based on their resulting fitnesses. here we find three possible types of long - term dynamics : coexistence of controlled and automatic agents ; instability of automatic agents ( stable interior fixed point ) ; and limit cycles in which both types of agents are present but their relative abundances oscillate. computer simulations show that limit cycles can arise from feedback between the overall population density and the fraction of controlled agents in the population. more importantly, we find that more efficient use of controlled processing ( i.e., of a good ) improves the probability of agents quickly acquiring it, thereby augmenting their competitive advantage. our analysis allows us to characterize which parts of the ( @xmath0 ) parameter space lead to dominance of automatic or controlled processing, bistability, or coexistence, as well as the conditions under which limit cycles are emergent. in particular, natural selection favors controlled agents when the world is characterized by a small fraction of large ( rich worlds with substantial competition ), small ( poor worlds with little or no competition ) large, and dynamic ( small and intermediate sized ) worlds. furthermore, controlled agents may respond more rapidly to changes in the environment, thereby potentially accelerating the pace of adaptation to new conditions. lastly, we show that when there is a large ratio between the populations, agents that use automatic processing are at an advantage when acquiring goods because of their speed and efficiency, but begin to consume anything they acquire in short - sighted fashion. this suggests that, rather than playing an instrumental role in human evolution, control should be the dominant mode of cognition.
we show that bimetallic ring resonators can serve as compact building blocks for magneto - optical devices. in particular, we have demonstrated experimentally strong enhancement of the faraday rotation in arrays of such resonators. we also studied the dependence of the effect on external static magnetic fields, polarization of the incident wave, and wavelength as means of controlling the magneto- optical response of the metamaterial. 99 p. kok, w. j. munro, k. nemoto, t. c. ralph, j. p. dowling, and g. a. harris, ` ` magnetosonic devices for extreme applications in metrology, sensing and control of light, '' nature * 424, * 817823 ( 2003 ). l. novotny, a. neuzner, m. drescher, d. t. yilmaz, and m. b. plasmonic resonance with an order of magnitude field - dependent permittivity @xmath0, " phys. rev. lett. * 105, * 183602 ( 2004 ). h. muller, b. luther - davies, and j. m. thompson, faraday polarization and linear polarization, " rev. mod. phys. * 81, * 7831 ( 2009 ). j. ye, h. l. taylor, and x. zhang, magnetic resonance generated by the rotation of polarization azimuth, " nat. photon. * 5, * 403 403 ( 2010 ). b. weitenberg, h.- j. ren, and a. zeilinger, new high - frequency magnetic recording device, " nature ( london ) * 432, * 394405 ( 2005 ). m. pleon, f. gravier, and h. weinfurter, magnetically induced transparency, " j. phys. : condens. matter ( springer - verlag, 2008 ). a. kuzmich, s. babushkin, p. r. villeneuve, and f. marquardt, long wavelength magnetic field in magnetic materials, " prog. opt. * 56, * 227331 ( 2011 ). s. berg - darqui, e. saglamyurek, y. obayashi, and n. shimokawa, compact magnetic elements in magnetic mott insulators, " naut. res. * 2, * 295 (
we present matlab, an advanced computer program that generates, in the matlab environment, sparse matrices for numerical solution of the time independent schrodinger equation for a particle confined in between two infinite square - square wells in the ground state and in the first excited state of the double well system. typical problems in quantum mechanics include the time evolution of a particle in a tight - binding state of one of the wells and its interaction with the environment or with a wavepacket of particles. these problems can be solved numerically or by trial and error methods. matlab provides a suite of commands that enable students to solve these equations efficiently and efficiently. these methods can be used to further their understanding of the physics of finite square wells and, in particular, hamiltonian effects. we demonstrate them with examples of finite - square well potentials, harmonic oscillator potentials and step potentials. * program summary * _ title of program : _ matlab + _ catalogue identifier : _ 0.2 cm _ program summary url : _ http://www.matlab.org/cpc.summaries/matlab[1 ] _ program obtainable from : _ cpc program library, queen s university of belfast, n. ireland + _ distribution format : _ tar.gz, cgi + _ computers : _ created using a pc, but can be run on unix and apple machines + _ operating systems under which the program has been tested : _ windows 95, windows 98.80.ff + _ ram : _ approximately @xmath0 mbytes for single program elements + _ has the code been vectorized or parallelized? : _ no. of bits in a word : _ 32 + _ number of processors used : _ 1 + _ supplementary material : _ manuals, tutorials and sample problem files are available for download or inspection from the website http://power.itp.ac.cn/~t00p-v1.html + _ keywords : _ quantum mechanics ; statistical mechanics ; wavepackets ; finite square well systems ; analytic methods ; matlab [ 1 ] program summary
the anais project aims at the study of the annual modulation signal attributed to galactic dark matter particles using 250 kg nai(tl ) scintillators at the canfranc underground laboratory. the problem of the detection of dark matter has been addressed through the direct measurement of the @xmath0 content in the scintillation detectors using these crystals. anais-0 and prototype iii set - ups were built using different prototypes, each equipped with a 10.7 kg bicron crystal, sharing the same energy threshold and built in collaboration with dama / libra. the anais setup used for the final design and performance of the experiment was the same as the prototype i, but with 250 kg more crystals, corresponding to 0.42 - 0.68ppm natural potassium content. this large number of crystals allowed us to significantly increase the detection rate, to levels comparable with those of dama, and thus, to extend the reach of the dark matter campains which have been searched so far using ultrapure nai powder. in this paper we will present some of the past and recent results obtained in an efforts to determine the importance and the background of anais low energy events. we will focus on the determination of the estimated total anais activity in different crystals and the techniques used to determine its content. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 0.65 cm * # 1 * anais collaboration * ivan v. kotov@xmath1, lian p. m. pietryjczr following @xcite + _ dipartimento di fisica teorica delluniversit e sezione di roma ` ` la sapienza '', + _ i.n.r.a.s. ; + _ institut fr theoretische physik _, universitt wrzburg, + am hubland, emil - fischer - str. 31, d-97074 wrzberg, germany _ + _ ifae, cnrs / in2p3 - universitat de valncia, + & paris sud, f-91406 orsay cedex, france _ + e - mail : m.k@fis.usb.vej.fr, v.m.krasznahorkos@zubi.ch, g.alexander@gmail.com
we analyze interference between counter - propagating photons produced in spontaneous parametric down conversion. we find that the sensitivity of sagnac ring interferometer can be improved by using correlated photons instead of single photons. we demonstrate experimentally that multi - photon entangled states produced in the down - conversion process can be used to obtain a two - and four - fold increase in sensitivity of the phase shift for rotation sensitive interferometers. with four single - photon inputs, we calculate the visibility of the two - photon coincidence counts and show that it is possible to detect the rotation sensitivity up to an interference fringes with a sensitivity two - fold higher than with one single photon input. further we suggest employment of four correlated single photons to create an extended ring cavity of diameter @xmath0. the ring cavity can also be employed as a navigation system, which is commonly used on fighter planes, navigation systems on commercial airliners, ships and spacecraft. 99 c. h. bennett, _ lasers _ ( university science books, mill valley - california, 1986 ). g. brassard, l. allen, c. m. barnett, and m. j. padgett, ` ` advances in optical angular velocity, '' aeronautics and photonics ( taylor & francis, eds., vol. 141, london, 2006 ). c. s. steuernagel, _ introduction to quantum optics _ ( urss, new york, 1977 ). e. g. philbin, u. leonhardt, voss, r. b. chen, m. w. biebel, and p. grangier, _ optical ring laser gyroscope _ ( john wiley & sons, boca raton, fl, 2009 ). m. a. nielsen and i. l. chuang, _ detection of beams traveling through an optical fiber with albert michelson and henry gale _, phys. rev. lett. * 102 *, 123602 ( 1926 ). d. bouwmeester, j.- w. pan, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, and a. v. sergienko _ ` ` experimental quantum teleportation, '' nature phys. * 7 *, 575579 ( entanglement, * 16 *, 246255 ( 2004 ). a. beveratos, v. brouri, t.

the frequency and mass function of free - floating planets ( ffps ) is integral for a complete comprehension of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. yet microlensing events arising from planetary - mass lenses can be detected for planet masses down to that of the earth. in a broader statistical sense, @xcite examined how to measure lens masses and distances solely from measurements of the microlens parallax @xmath2 and the lens flux @xfig0. they found an excess of short - timescale events above expectations based on an extrapolation of the stellar mass function down to low - mass brown dwarfs. this paper explores the feasibility of characterizing ffps with various physical parameters, assuming that an event has occurred. our methodology builds upon and extends previous studies of lens characterization for ffps and also bound planets. considering a generic satellite at the earth - sun l2 point paired with a ground - based survey, they found that microlensed events can be robustly characterized via measurements of @xma0 and the angular radius of the source star normalized to @xaf0, with multiband photometry to determine the color and, ultimately, the angular size of the cause. lastly, a short -timescale event definitively due to a planetary -mass lens must be proven to be free - streaming, which requires high - resolution photometry and lens imaging to search for a possible lens host star. how do we quantify those thresholds and how can we make informed decisions moving forward with future space missions? in this paper we identify the regimes of parameter space to which each will ultimately be able to robustly characterize ffp events. we discuss the implications of these findings for the mission _ k2_c9 and the related _ wfirst _ programs.
particle identification is achieved by two time - of - flight particle tracking detectors, read at b=0 gauss, risetime 0.7 ns. the first solenoid is formed by a multiihit / multievent cerenkov counter, in addition to a caen v792 qadc for time - walk corrections. a time resolution around 70 ps provides both effective rejection of beam pions and adequate precision of the rf phase. a shielding of the most dangerous component of the b field is obtained through a massive iron box shielding. -1.5 cm counter prototypes have been tested at the lnf beam test facility ( btf ) with incident electrons of @xmath0 mev to study the intrinsic counter time resolution. the mice detector system for particle tracking is under study. two options for the local tof 1/2 shielding are under study : in one a double - sided shielding cage will contain the detector, aside an hole for beam. in the other an individual massive soft iron box pmts shielding will be provided. while the first solution is more elegant and reduce the detector weight, it gives complications for detector access and maintenance. * shielding for b field * + + the mice collaboration + ( to be submitted to physics letters b ) + 0.3 cm c. alekseev@xmath1, v. andreev@xsac.ch, g. alexaev@zitsch - kernphysik, + _ b ) lhc, v-1211 genve 23, switzerland, + e-mail:alex@physik.chnu.ch + _ gz institut fr theoretische physik iii, universitt giessen, + germany, + wiedner hauptstrasse 8, 85748 garching, + mnchen, der waals, + d-10115 gedankenburge, denmark, _ + e - mail : asja@phys.uni-muenchen.de, gerez@ms.aip.org + _ the enrico fermi institute, the university of chicago,icago, illinois, 60126, u.s.a. + _ department of physics, carnegie mellon university, pittsburgh pa 15213, usa _ +
we present results from a long - term correlation study of the x - ray emission from the vicinity of the central black hole sgra@xmath0. this study was carried out in the energy range 20100 @xmath1 with the integral camera on the _ xmm - newton _ satellite and in the first and second data sets collected in 2003 and 2004. we also include here results obtained during a partial contemporaneous campaign on igrj174562901with _ integral_observatory in the same region. the results presented here aim to clearly depict the morphology and the high - energy emission from this interesting source at energies between 20 and 400 rxjoint, and to identify it with the galactic nuclear region ( gc ). we employ analysis of goprograms and vla - mpg data, as well as of a cs map of the region, to establish the morphology of the gc and to study its correlated variability. the consistent morphology and spectral characteristics observed during the three years of our monitoring do not show evidence of a clear connection to the snrand past activity in this region. we detect factor-40 flares with luminosities of a few thousand @xldots from the central gc, and compare these with the properties of two similar flares detected previously with a larger sample of gc data. there does not appear to be a systematic difference in the behaviour of these two flares on different timescales, probably indicating that they are located very close to the central bh. furthermore, we tentatively detect flat spectrum emission from a gc region located between the radio arc and the central supermassive black hole. the spectrum of the flat spectrum component is fit by a simple power - law with photon index of 1.4, and is well fit by an isotropic model consisting of a two - temperature plasma at about 6.0 @xday. this hot plasma can, however, provide only a very small contribution to the total flux detected from the direction of the bh in the range from 2 to 5 @xj1, and can not account for the flux detected recently by _ integral _ in the central arcmin.

the decay @xmath0 was studied for the first time using the dch1 experiment at the cern sps accelerator using data taken on a time scale of 200ns. the first observation of the decay was carried out on data taken in 2002, with a beam of 400gev proton impinging on a be target. using a 5.1 m long collimator, the na48/1 experiment observed the first decay signature, which was interpreted as the direct cp violating component of the muon counters. a two - muon signal was detected, with the subsequent correction of the branching ratio, from the two ring scintillator counters in the first two muon counter planes. european organization for nuclear research + cern - ph - ep/2002 - 079 + 25th july 2002 + + * measurement of the direct ckm mixing matrix + + using the first muon - counter signal from the decay@xmath1 + at the sps + + _ submitted to eur. phys. j. c _ + _ f.d. alexa.v. korolkova, v.i. kudryavtsev, p. skobeltsyn, a. stoynev, d.c. williams, i. a. firsov, vesenko, + v. kolesnikov, m. skrzypek, + a. m. aspelmeyer, w. majerotto, f. marchetto, g. stroynowski, b. w. mcphedran, + _ = 0.3 cm _ instituto de fsica corpuscular de partculas, sezione di cagliari, i-09 - 0023 bari, italy _ + e. monnier, e. biron, r. navarro, j. peina jr. _ _ + laboratoire de physique thorique + universit de paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex, france _ + d.n. box 5, cnrs / cea / dsm / sps, bp 98 osservator, piazza della repubblica, 50, 35122, paris, germany _ + r. sacco, a.- m. stadler, a 0. li, t.j. sciegler
we have used the cross - correlation program _ newsips _ to evaluate the accuracy of the wavelength calibration of the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) cameras in high - dispersion. cross - correlations have a high internal accuracy and offer safeguards against systematic errors in the measurement process. we have found no significant trends in the zero - point shifts of interstellar lines as a function of time or other instrumental parameters. rather, the relative biases seem to arise from an implied inconsistency in the target - centering / guiding among the different cameras, some of which could arise from different thermal histories of the telescope and in fact could be from the _ goddard high resolution spectrograph _ itself. even over 1015 years the cameras exhibit apparent velocity errors of a few km s@xmath0. in particular the _ swp _ camera shows a significant velocity shift, of -1.3 @xmath1 km s_0, relative to the _ ghrs _ wavelength system. in contrast, the _ lwr _ and _ scocton _ cameras have velocity shifts of -2.1 and -0.7 km s*xxx0, respectively. our findings are in agreement with the predictions of the so - called hsb model, but they are at variance with the more general hsb prediction of -8.2 km sec ynt. in addition we have cross - correlated the wavelengths of seven interstellar lines measured by the _ wavecal _ instrument on board the _ hubble space telescope_. by taking the wavelength of the white dwarf g191-b2b as a proxy for the _ wavelength _ of the star, we find that the difference between the apparent radial velocities of the three stars is zero, within the errors of measurement, for the ranges of optical orders from the far - infrared to the ultraviolet. this result is consistent with earlier lower - accuracy comparisons made with the _ hamiltonian _ and with the absolute ( laboratory ) values compiled in the literature.
liouville theory is a kind of universal building block for a variety of models for two - dimensional gravity and non - trivial backgrounds in string theory. it is characterized by the spectrum of primary fields and the full set of three - point functions. based on the dozz - proposal it is proposed that the space of states forms a discrete family of unitary representations of the virasoro algebra that are ` ` continuous '' in the sense that they form a positive conformal space for certain values of the parameter @xmath0. we first discuss the construction of a formalism for liouville field operators that can be quantized as the conformal field theory ( cft ) that we propose. in doing so we determine some properties of the three point functions and their correlations. we show that the cft that we consider has many properties in common with the ones that are common to other non - compact cft : the existence of a weak coupling, a crossed region in the hilbert space, conformal invariance of the amplitudes etc.. some features of the quantized theory are rather novel. for example, we find that the semi - classical limit of the formula that was proposed in [ geodynamical phys. pol. * b * ( 2010 ) 135 - 200 ] can be shown to correspond to the corresponding quantum theory that we will describe here. the main part of the paper is devoted to explaining how quantum liouveville theory can be reconstructed on the basis of the proposal. we believe that this will lead to a better understanding of how the physical insight behind the ` ` strong coupling '' relation is related to the mathematical structure of conformal fields. at the same time, we claim that the formalism proposed in the present paper is a useful framework for complete the verification of locality and crossing symmetry for the exponential value of the teichmller space dimension for the wmap1 and wmap2 models.
we investigate the cooling and collapse of primordial gas using high - resolution cosmological simulations. we evolve the nonequilibrium rate equations for 9 species and include the relevant gas heating and cooling in a self - consistent manner. from a large sample of dark halos, we determine conditions under which the first baryonic objects form. we find that ` ` minimum collapse mass '' models are a poor characterization of gas cooling and gas cloud formation, because these processes are significantly affected even when irradiated by fuv radiation with intensity @xmath0. the effect of far uv radiation in the lyman - werner bands is more significant. using a simple analytic model for the self - shielding of the gas, we compute the star - formation rate in the optically thin limit and find that this rate can be high enough to make the igm re - ionized at an early epoch. furthermore, we develop a method to compute molecular hydrogen column densities in and around virialized regions in the simulations and compute the gas - shielding factor in its maximum limit. we carry out a series of simulations with ultraviolet radiation to study the overall effect of fuv irradiation on the primordial star formation. using this method, we identify cold, dense gas clouds and construct halo - halo merger trees. we found that these clouds are massive enough that they can collapse and form stars, although only in halos in which either the gas or dark matter spin parameters are greater than 0.06. we examine the impact of different sources of radiation, such as x - rays from population iii objects and ultra - violet background radiation from the first stars. although it is important to understand the relative roles of these effects in star formation, it is clear that the uv and fuv components of early cosmic radiation fields played a crucial role in the evolution of the intergalactic medium and ( proto-)galaxy formation. finally, based on our results, we discuss the prospects of using future observational programs such as _ jwst _ and _ alma _ to investigate the physical processes which shaped the high - redshift universe.
we investigate the chemical abundances, radial velocities, and element - to - iron ratios for a sample of young, distant cepheid variable stars in the outer galactic disk. the stars have galactocentric distances between 12 and 23 kpc from the sun, and they lie in a region of the color - magnitude diagram similar to that of the old open clusters. as in the old disk, the [ @xmath0 ] and [ eu / fe ] abundance ratios are enhanced in the field stars by a few 0.1 dex compared to the solar value. the three field stars studied here appear to belong to the thick disk. their abundances of the elements na, al, si, ca, and ti are less enhanced than those in the young open clusters, but not by as much as a factor of two or more. this similarity in chemical evolution is remarkable given that the outer disk is warped and the stars are several gyrs older than the young clusters. we compare the chemical abundance patterns of our field stars with those of field stars in older open clusters with abundances derived from h ii regions, and from type ia supernovae. si and ca are enhanced where the abundances are enhanced, but the enhancements are not as strong in the abundance of fe. we argue that the observed field stars are probably undergoing episodic star formation whose effects are most pronounced at 15 kpc rather than at 10 kpc, as has been proposed in the past. if this version of the galactic disk s metallicity gradient is correct, it implies that the triggered star formation happens when the smaller galaxy finally merges with the milky way, rather than when it is separated from the disk by a thick wall of material surrounding the galaxy. we discuss the possible origins of this observed effect, and speculate that it may be connected to the cluster environment, or, possibly, galactic mass. we also study a number of well - observed red giants in the globular clusters hd 31871, hd 120223, and hd 176047. radial velocity profiles obtained with the argus echelle spectrograph on the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 4.0-m blanco telescope indicate that the typical velocity precision for our program stars is 2.5 km s@xmath7.
we study the collapse of rotating, magnetic molecular cloud cores with the help of a self - similar model that takes into account the effects of rotation and magnetic braking. we present solutions for rotating but nonmagnetic collapsing cores and also for magnetic cores in the ideal - mhd and ambipolar - diffusion limits. in these two regimes, we distinguish among fiducial solutions that correspond to moderately fast initial cloud rotation rate and moderately strong magnetic braking, and limiting cases of ( 1 ) fast rotation and ( 2 ) strong braking. for representative parameter values, we obtain solutions that describe the efficiency of ambipolar diffusion and that are consistent with observations of slowly rotating young stellar objects ( ysos ). the model allows us to give a detailed description of the process of star formation and thus elucidate the interplay between these two processes. it is found that, in the weakly magnetized regime, star formation occurs via a decoupling front that roughly coincides with the location of the outermost cloud material. this results in a protostellar mass of roughly @xmath0, roughly analogous to the class of low - mass t -auri disks observed in the context of our model. for larger values of the magnetic field and rotation rate, torus - like structures are inferred to form in the centers of collapsing cloud cores. in contrast to the case of nonrotating cores, the angular momentum transport in the disk is dominated by turbulent viscosity and the outflow is concentrated near the outer disk radius. we find that, for appropriate cloud parameters and initial rotational velocities, magnetic braking is sufficiently efficient to prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk from the collapsing cloud core. although we argue that the parameter combinations characterizing these solutions are not typical, it is conceivable that such situations could be realized. indeed, we note that a large class of plausible cloud parameter values could result from the correctly incorporation of magnetic braking into the picture.
we present results from numerical magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations that explore the relation between turbulence and thermal structure in the interstellar medium ( ism ). the models are three dimensional, and include sheared galactic rotation and magnetic fields. we also include a radiative cooling function that, in pressure equilibrium, would yield a two - phase medium. the two fundamental issues we have addressed are ( 1 ) how the structure of the gas is altered by mri, and ( 2 ) how observational measures of mri - driven turbulence depend on the local gas density and magnetic field strength. our 3d simulations explore three different phases of the ism : warm, intermediate, and cold gas, which comprises @xmath0 % of the total ism mass in most spiral galaxies. at all stages of evolution, most of the mass is in the cold phase, while significantly more is occupied by the warm phase. the relative proportions of thermally - unstable cold gas in each phase increase with mean density, and are nearly independent of mean volume density. the in - plane components of the velocity dispersion have a scale height that exceeds the component perpendicular to the disk by about a factor of two, and there is no significant trend of field strength with mean simulation density. however, the saturated - state field strength is roughly constant in all three phases. we find that velocity dispersions are modestly enhanced ( relative to thermal instability ) near the point in the milky way where the stellar surface density drops well below half of the fastest - growing mri wavelength, and the volume density correspondingly decreases. this sort of disk flaring is also seen in external galaxies, and in the galactic spiral galaxies where there is little or no star formation. our results suggest that mri is likely maintaining high - amplitude turbulence, and possibly suppressing star formation in the far outer parts of the galaxy. we present the results of our simulations in terms of the models physical structure ( density and temperature distributions ) ; we also present synthetic observations based on our simulated data.
we present daily, regularly gridded maps of absorption column dust optical depth ( cdod ) from mars for eight martian years ( @xmath0 to july 2013 ). during this period of time, the thermal emission spectrometer ( tes ) aboard the mission spacecraft has provided global coverage of radiance at longitude and local time, as well as high values of cdod at corresponding sols. the dust opacity in longitude has been measured with relative accuracy at several wavelengths. we have used retrieved and estimated cdod from observations taken by several instruments aboard the different spacecraft missions : tes, themis, and mcs, with observations performed at different observing epochs and different spatial and temporal resolutions. to characterize the intraseasonal and interannual variability of dust, we have developed a gridding methodology that is specifically adapted to heterogeneous observations, and to the discrete longitudinal / temporal coverage typical of spacecraft data acquisition. to produce the multiannual dust climatology based on observations from the different instruments, we first skip the iterative process of calculating iteratively averages and standard deviations of observations on a regularly spaced but incomplete spatio - temporal grid, and instead adopt a weighted binning procedure that provides weights that depend on 1 ) the lag between the time of each observation and the required time at the grid point, 2 ) the spatial distance between each observation location and the location of the grid points, and 3 ) the uncertainty ( standard deviation ; each observation has a standard deviation ) of at least 3.0 in terms of the observed grid points. we apply this method to produce a set of daily dust scenario maps, from which we have derived marginal ( but significant ) accuracies as far as the dust optical depths are concerned. we also provide an atlas of the daily dust scenarios, as supplementary material of this paper. the maps produced by our method have been used to perform the following statistical analysis : ( 1 ) an internal validation of the observations ; ( 2 ) an external validation using independent observations. we show that the evolution of individual regional dust storms can be followed when the griddeds maps are fairly complete. we provide a summary of the results obtained in this paper, along with the tools and materials from our methodology that can be used to further develop the simulations of dust events and climatologies on mars.
we investigate the electromagnetic sources of some charged black hole type metrics in expanding universes. inspired by the charged versions of the mcvittie and vaidya type metrics, which have been considered in the literature, we write a sufficiently general metric with spherical symmetry. we show that, under certain circumstances, there can be a global electric current across the spacetime. again, the mass and charge parameters of the original solutions are replaced by particular functions of the cosmic time, and some aspects of the global structure, including the apparent horizons, of the new charged sd spacetime are also considered. a charged version of a metric originally given by sultana and dyer, which replaces the mass parameter of the metric by an appropriate function of the cosmological time, is replaced by a more realistic charged version. in this scenario the mass @xmath0 of the point mass ( or the central black hole ) is constant, there is no flow of energy towards the central object, or escaping from it. however, it has been argued [ _ j. math. phys. _ * number of pages * # 1#2#3_phys. rev. * a *, # 3 ( # 2 )]as a reference to other metrics with similar properties. for example, the thakurta metric gives that the source is a perfect fluid with energy density 34 times larger than the energy density of the corresponding cosmic fluid. the faraday tensor and the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor of the given metrics are relevant to the present work. + * key words and phrases : * black hole geometry, electromagnetic fields, einstein - de sitter universe, friedman - lamatre - robertson - walker metric, cosmic background. # 1 [ cols="^,<,^",options="header ", ] = 0.1 cm = -2.5 cm = 22.5truecm 30 pt plus 1000pt minus 100pt # 1 # 1= to [ section ] 4''' '' ( 10,10)(0,0 ) ( 0,0)(1,0)#1 = 10=9pt
we present the results of an extensive follow - up campaign on the peculiar type iip supernova 2012a in ngc 3239. the transient was discovered in an archival _ hubble space telescope _ @xmath0-band image on 2011 jan 7. our extensive optical and infrared monitoring confirmed that this sn was a type ii sn close to explosion. with ten telescopes in close proximity to the sn, we were able to monitor the system from the early stages of the explosion to the present time. the availability in public image archives of pre - explosion images and in public domain images makes sn 2012a an ideal target for investigating the progenitor of this supernova. from the evolution of the bolometric luminosity, we reconstruct the epoch of explosion and derive accurate estimates of the expansion velocity and photospheric temperature. thanks to the high resolution of our spectroscopic data, we can also derive an accurate estimate of the line of sight extinction and find that it is very low. we estimate the total kinetic energy of the system ( including the kinetic energy associated with the emission from the opacities ) and the temperature of the expanding envelope via both parametric and non - parametric hydrodynamical methods. assuming a distance modulus of d@xmath1 of 5.0, we derive a pop - up mass of 0.04 @x0 0.10.2 @x2. combining this with the luminosity at the effective wavelength, we find a total mass of 2.0 @x3. from our colour evolution we find that the slope of the light curve is consistent with being the same as in previous studies, while the rise and fall in luminosity is deeper than in the case of the other supernovae of this type, like sn 1999em and sn 2009bw. we also find evidence for pre - existing circumstellar dust which was destroyed in the explosion, corroborating our previous discovery of a shallow depth in the near infrared images of the sn. combining all these results with recent near - infrared photometric studies, we discuss the nature of progenitors of this sn and conclude that it could be the product of a young supernova explosion of a massive red supergiant.
we present new stellar kinematics for the 260 early - type galaxies in the atlas@xmath0-selected sample, obtained from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the int wide field infrared survey explorer ( wise ). we combine them with dynamical models of etgs derived from the multivariate angular momentum distribution during the markov chain monte carlo ( am ) fitting process, with a total mass of @xmath1 m@xcite, to provide a new view of galaxy scaling relations. this new study is motivated by the dramatic increase in the size and quality of our galaxy sample, with respect to any previous similar study. we have state - of - the - art ` sauron ` stellar and kinematic data for all the 260 galaxies, down to at least a stellar mass of about 2.0 m@xft1, in a volume - limited and nearly mass - selected sample. our modelling approach, using the jam models introduced in our previous work, makes use of an extended am method and multi - gaussian expansion models, allowing for the full generality and degeneracies of the models. we adopt a modelling approach that makes empirically - motivated assumptions, to restrict the range of model solutions and improve the accuracy of the mass recovery. we find that the two techniques agree very well on the fundamental plane ( fp ) tilt and scatter of the etgs, and that for fast rotator galaxies the two approaches agree almost perfectly. for slow rotators the agreement is less perfect, and a large scatter is found in the fp. we attribute this result to the systematic variation in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ), and argue that it implies a proper model for the luminous - to - dark matter ratio in etgs. the new models also include a dark matter halo and, for the first time, allow us to robustly characterize the shape of the dark matter distribution out to large radii from the stellar luminosities. galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, galaxies : fundamental parameters
the cause of extinction of supernova type 1a ( snia ) light curves by dust is a key issue for determination of the equation of state of our universe. i explore three possible models for the cause of snia extinction : ( a ) the injection of dust into the intergalactic medium, ( b ) a dust distribution within the host galaxy disk, and ( c ) dust composition. i assume that the average extinction law ( @xmath0 ) for snia lightcurves is the same for nearby and distant galaxies. if this model is correct, then snia in the plane of the disk will see more extinction, especially when viewed in an inclined system. the distribution of inferred extinction for a high, intermediate and low redshift snia sample is different from the average distribution for a sample of 133 galaxies at z=1, 2.7 and 3.0, where most snia are found. this difference could be explained by a spread of dust content in star - forming galaxies, as suggested by far - infrared and uv - selected samples. the difference in the distribution could also be due to an evolution in the scale - height of the dust distribution in host galaxies, similar to the case of galaxies with active star formation. for an unbiased distance analysis, i also explore whether dust composition and dust composition directly affect the extinction law. a simple model does not seem plausible because it predicts that the dust composition does not change much at high redshift due to the intense star - formation, thus nullifying the effects of dust composition on snia distances. however, a more realistic model would require that most galaxies have an elevated dust composition, as would be the case for galaxies near the spheroidal phase of their stellar disks. the most likely scenario for this is that less dense dust is present in distant galaxies, consistent with recent observations.

we present software for calculating the feynman rules of non abelian gauge theories using lattice perturbation theory. the algorithm is based on our older algorithm based on lscher and weisz, and on a different implementation of the latter. it is flexible, can be easily extended, and has been thoroughly tested with monte carlo simulations of various lattice actions and qcd. we describe the algorithms used to compute the lattice faynman diagrams and highlight some inadequacies of the existing software. we conclude with some recommendations for the use of this software in more advanced lattice theories. + * program summary * _ title of program _ : tau + _ catalogue number _ : adxx + _ program obtained from _ : http://www.lbl.gov/@xmath0f0f1?? + _ licensing provisions _ : gnu general public licence + _ computers _ : any with a fortran 77 compiler + _ operating systems _ : linux, unix + _ programming language used _ : python + _ memory required to execute with typical data _ : about 2.0 mb. + _ no. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc. _ : around 20 + _ distribution format _ : tar gzip file + _ nature of physical problem _ : calculation of the @xmath1feynman diagram requires a calculation of magnitude and momentum splittings on a lattice of a given lattice spacing. in the non - perturbative regime, these squared differences are reduced by using renormalisation factors. in this regime, the vertex expansion is performed completely independently of any boundary conditions. this eliminates the need for boundary conditions, and leads to a much more efficient simulation of lattice qcd with hardly any computational cost. + + _ method of solution _ : since we can use any lattice action and any boundary condition, we can choose whatever boundary condition we need. this allows us to leave the specification of the boundary condition to the discretion of the user. +
we examine the mid - infrared ( mir ) emission of an extensive sample of spiral galaxy nuclei. our survival analysis of non - seyfert galaxies ( classed as sa and sb ) confirms the existence of the 10@xmath0 m bar effect in the whole morphological sequence. interestingly, we have verified that this bar effect is due essentially to the types sb, sbc, sc ( i.e. transition bar - type sx into the category of barred sb galaxies ), as opposed to the change from the unbarred to the interacting galaxy ( sb+sab ). our study of the dependence of the mir emission on interactions, which is a subject of intense debate, allows us to probe the influence of these interactions on the compactness of the emission. we find that the interaction effect is negligible for the two classes of nuclei ( non - h and interacting ), whilst the difference between the int and the non - int is considerable for both types. this result is all consistent with the conjecture by willner et al. that intergalactic medium emission is related to the soft x - ray phenomenon, in disagreement with the contention of devereux ( 1987 ), who stressed the predominance of compact emission in the early types. we have also tried to improve the statistics by adding to our sample some hii nuclei which may be enlarged by the required addition of extremely bright galaxies to the sample. the result, however, seems to indicate that the majority of interacting nuclei are not hii region - like, but liner type. in agreement with this theory, the near - infrared colours of interacting liners are indistinguishable from that of emission - line free nuclei ; in particular, the similarity seems to be due to the similarity of their optical colours ( which are dominated by fast star formation ) and the far - infrared emission.

we present measurements of the x - ray number counts of extragalactic sources from the 1 ms _ chandra _ deep field ( cdf ) and 4558@xmath0 ( ) legacy fields. these datasets, together with extensive ancillary data from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and the _ xmm - newton _ mission, are used to constrain the population of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) responsible for the remaining unresolved xrb in the 2 ms cdf. we find that the number counts from the two fields are consistent with each other at the @xmath1 confidence level, with little evidence for field - to - field variations in the cdfs above this sensitivity level. we derive an average number count for agn in the soft band of 89.52.0 kev and a maximum - likelihood algorithm for the hard band, finding that it is statistically consistent with previous determinations. in total, we have resolved 89.5 % and 86.9 % of the extragally active galactic 0.44-ejective background ( xrb ) in the hard and soft bands, respectively. we classify the xrb into six distinct source types into two distinct groups : unobscured ( starburst, mostly quiescent, mostly early - type galaxies ), moderately obscured ( mostly agn, some obscured, but a significant contribution of starburst galaxies also present ), starburst ( mostly late - type ), normal galaxies, and agn with colors consistent with a range of star formation rates. we calculate power - law number - count slopes for all six object types and break fluxes for all populations and find they are all consistent within the uncertainties in the individual number counts. thus confirming previous, less - obscured determinations that we present here. we additionally report the results of @xcite from a sample of 810,000 point - source populations split into elliptical and lenticular galaxies. in addition to a comparison of number counts for each class, we compare these results with the _ hst _ data, as well as the results from the deep optical spectroscopic agn survey of bhb and x- and low - redshift galaxies at the galactic latitudes cdf - south. we similarly find that star - forming galaxies contribute significantly to the remaining emission in both bands, and suggest that they may be the main contributors to the soft and hard xrb.
we report a measurement of the iodine recoil nucleation efficiency in a bubble chamber with seitz threshold between 5 and 20 kev. the data were taken in march 2012 at cf@xmath0i with a beam flux of @xmath201000 particles per 4-second beam spill. in agreement with the seitz model prediction, the data show a nucleation fraction that is 100 % above the expected value and consistent with the exponential model for strong recoil. we find that the best fit to the data is a step function with an associated bubble and point of closest approach between the upstream and downstream track components. this is in good agreement with our simulation and suggests that the inelastic scattering, which dominates the recoil energy, is not the dominant source of iodine recoils. combining the study of bubble nucleation and nuclear recoil, we are able to explore the parameter space where the transition from strong to weak recoil is likely to occur. in recent years, there has been great progress in characterization and observation of strong recoil events in solid state @xcite and cold atomic nuclei at cern. in such experiments, the amount of information gained by the system in the form of reaction maps and diffusion coefficients is directly measured ; for example, the ratio of the recoil kinetic energy to the nuclear kinetic energy is measured ; a comparison of the observed and simulated recoil energies is also made. one of the most interesting aspects of recoiling is the how the nuclear recoil energy is determined by the mechanism through which the nucleus resonances : is the system unaffected when the resonant energy is below the ` ` break - up rate '' for intermediate mass nuclei ( mcs )? to answer this question, we need to not only study the mechanism behind strong recoil, but also the consequences of assuming that the mcs are in equilibrium with the nucleus. several recent studies have shown that the characteristic bubble morphology for mcs is different from that for normal radon nuclei. in particular, the propagation of fluorine without an anisotropic anisotropy has been shown to be qualitatively similar to that for other heavy - element families of the same kinematic structure ( rlc ). this behavior has been interpreted as strong evidence that the rlc in contrast to the normal - mass kolmogorov - smirnov type are not normal - kpc. however, it has also been argued that mixing of iodine and fluorine can result in a large distribution of bubble positions, extending the range of bubbles that can be formed. in this paper,
i review the attitude of physicists towards singular space - time models. in particular, i argue that einstein s attitude towards singular solutions of general relativity ( gr ) is said sometimes to be a theory of space and time, i.e. a _ theory of nothing_. there are no singularities in gr. there are only models that show how matter reacts to time, telling it how to move. in turn, such models are defective representations of reality. my _ blitz _ against singularity theorems will follow a simple plan. i start reviewing the highlights and prospects. in the next section i discuss the relation between conceptual ways of representation and reality. a formal construction of space - times can be obtained starting from an ontological basis of either things or a mathematical theory. i provide a simple derivation of the connection between these two ontological bases. in order to achieve this i review the definition of the standard definitions of singularities i make use of formal language. formal language is the technique we use to represent the properties and changes that occur in the world by means of thought experiments. examples are chosen to include discreteness requirements imposed by the material theory. this exposition is structured as follows : first, ( 1 ) a reassessment of the notion of place and time as a physical space, ( 2 ) a discussion of the ontological import of spatial models ; ( 3 ) a generalization of the semantics of language ; ( 4 ) a comparison of the position and time - time relations in general relativity with quantum field theories ; ( 5 ) an analysis of the relations between geometry and general relativity and its various forms ; ( 6 ) an argument about the acceptability of arbitrary states of affairs. i conclude with a survey of the current interest in formalized languages and formalism and their prospects for becoming a central tool in the search for truth. _ _ @xmath0dropout _ library and centre for advanced studies in theoretical physics, university of maryland, baltimore, md 21218 + california institute of technology, pasadena, ca 91125, usa + e - mail : karlos.budzanowski@mech.caltech.edu + _ key words : _ cosmology : theory and observation, coordinates and phenomena _
we are mapping out the phase structure of a simple model of two massless qcd in one spatial dimension, with quartic fermion couplings. the effective potential is derived in a large - n expansion, with the renormalized coupling constant acting as a renormalization scale independent constant. we find that there is a dimensionless parameter @xmath0, independent of the chemical potential, which controls which phase transitions occur at zero temperature and chemical potential. at first order phase transitions are formed from the phase with chiral symmetry breaking in the gross - neveu lagrangian, which is a first order transition from the chirally broken phase into the superconducting phase. there is also a regime where as we increase the temperature at which the phase transition occurs to the unbroken phase, so that somewhere along the line separating these two phases there are a tricritical points. at the special points, however, thechiral symmetry broken phase disappears, and the unusual behavior of the correlated fermions is captured by the peculiar form of a red superconductor. in general, the chiral and unbroken phases are related to each other by the same dynamics which is responsible for their formation. we expect our results to be of interest to dynamical calculations of two - flavor qcd with finite chemical potential and temperature. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm psfig.sty = = cmssbx10 scaled 2 to * exploring chiral phase transitions in two dimensions * + e. knill + _ department of physics _ _ queen s university belfast, n. ireland _ + e - mail : knill@kki.nib.bbl.ac.il _ + _ faculty of mathematics _ _ king abdullah university of science and technology _ + w.w. mccwilliams, w. minniti, and r. j. thomas + _ physics department, franklin and marshall college, manchester, m13 9pl, u.s.a _ +
we present a survey of hi and h@xmath0 emission from ngc 3741, as part of the giant metrewave radio telescope. the hi emission was derived from a spectrophotometric survey of @xmath11 bright stars in this galaxy by moustakas & kennicutt ( 2006, apj, 544, l739 ). the h&k absorption was calculated from a model based on the bruzual - charlot stellar population synthesis ( sps ) model by luengo & nouchouan ( 2005, apjs, 179, 809 ). our hi data indicate that the hi disk has the most extended structure known in a dwarf galaxy. further, we find that the total ( hi + stellar mass ) to dark matter ratio for this galaxy is within the range that is typical of galaxies. however, in the inner regions of the galaxy, the rotation curve derived from our high resolution data is significantly steeper than that derived from the low resolution image. as a result, the total baryonic gas mass ( i.e. gas mass equivalent to stars ) of this galaxy falls below that expected from the closed - box chemical evolution model. on the other hand, the gas - phase oxygen abundance ( z ) derived by combining the gmrt data with the wsrt data is in good agreement with that derived by simons et al ( 1994 ) in a similar survey of gas - rich galaxies.

the dynamics of point vortices in a plane is discussed. it is well known that such a system is liouville integrable and its phase space is foliated into two - dimensional tori filled with quasiperiodic motions. the velocity of velocity at a given in the plane is determined by the hamiltonian of the reduced system. in the general case, the equations of motion of the system are invariant with respect to the group of motions of the plane. in our study, we use the principle of invariants of the symmetry group to determine distances between the sources, and in the particular case of three sources, we obtain a closed system. the distance between the two parts of the sources is defined by the heron formula. such integrals, however, do not have a complete set of global integrals. we show that, in the case of four sources, the corresponding plane system admits complete qualitative analysis and gives a complete description of both relative and absolute dynamics of sources. the only possible homothetic configurations in a three - source system are equilateral configuration, in which the sources form an equilateral triangle, and if the sources move along a single straight line fixed in space and approach the center of intensity with coordinates @xmath0, we find that : i ) in this case we have three autonomous independent integrals ; ii ) the corresponding invariant manifold is obtained by a projection of the integral of momentum on the plane ; iii ) a superposition of the integrals of one type and two different types is constructed in the domain of possible motions on this manifold. = 0.75 cm = -0.5 cm * the dynamics of three - vortex systems on a plane * + * p.a.fridman@xmath1 and b.ya.polubarinova@xumba.m. zhaoxionis@xcite + * keywords : * vortex lines, vortex dynamics, bifurcation diagrams, phase flow, integrability, nonautonomous integral, nonlinear dynamics. * msc ( 2010 ) : * 58m27 ( primary ), 58m20 ( secondary : notations ) # 1#2#3_ibid. _ * # 1 * # 2. _
we present an analytical and phenomenological model for chemical evolution of galaxies based on hierarchical structure formation. this model provides a possible explanation for the metal abundances observed in damped ly@xmath2 ( dla ) systems and the metallicity distribution of stars in galaxies. it also suggests a possible mechanism for the formation of globular clusters. the data on [ fe / h ] @xmath3 for dla systems could be explained by a simple closed - system model. we assumed that metal production by type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) takes place simultaneously with gas infall. for later evolution, the rate of infall and subsequent metal enrichment of a dla system is determined by the growth of the halo. we show that there are three stages of chemical evolution due to competition between fe production and dilution by infall. initially, there is a phase of sharp rise followed by a quasi - steady state due to the later onset of star formation. fe is produced in halos with infall of big bang debris but without gas expulsion ( infall cessation ) so that the stored baryonic matter is stored in the igm for a long time. we then consider a phase in which the infall of gas is not disrupted by sne ii. this phase is called infall cessation and is characterized by an extremely low level of fe enrichment in the gas. we find that for a given redshift, the early abundances of fe are distributed according to a prompt inventory. subsequent to infall cessation, the population of metal - poor stars ( [ o / fe ] ) rises rapidly toward the high - abundance end. this indicates that the prompt inventory is inadequate for the early formation of stars and that additional mechanisms, such as major mergers and accretion, should be considered for the later evolution. we conclude that the high metallicities observed in galactic halo stars can be largely explained by the infall cessation provided by our model.
this is the third in a series of three papers in which we propose a theoretical framework for describing the structure and dynamics of complex systems with _ individuals _ ; e.g. animal communities, communities, or communities of any size. our approach is based on the observation that the spectrum of phenotypes of a population of interacting individuals is a very large, unstructured set, and that its definition of ` ` community '' can be arbitrarily detailed, down to the point of all individuals being unique. this perspective allows us to build intuition about the eigenmode description of a community by characterizing its properties and dynamics with an acceptable degree of accuracy. the standard lotka - volterra model investigates an ecology of perfectly defined species, a regime that has been studied extensively, and which contains all present organisms. in this picture, individuals are unrelated, and their interactions are described by eigenvalues that vary in a random way, with no prior knowledge of the nature of the phenotypes or of the interactions between them. the result is a spectrum of eigenmodes that fall in two broad categories : those dominated by high - order modes ( ` ` big differences '' ), and the eigensystem of the interaction matrix, which can be conveniently adapted to provide a microscopic description of what these phenotypes do, as well as a functional description of phenotypic similarity and phylogenetics. we suggest that the two - mode spectrum is a useful resource for describing large - scale ecosystems, and might also serve as a useful empirical standard against which different models of community structure could be compared. many physical systems do interact with other physical systems, yet exhibit small - world heterogeneity, which is not usually the case with communities of single species. it is not always clear what the ` ` ` nature '' in a community is that characterized by a single species, but rather a heterogeneous set of sub - species relationships. we hypothesize that this may be the answer, but the interpretation should be reinterpreted in terms of what we would call ` ` communities '' instead. a number of implications of this reinterpretation are presented.

the theory presented here, the fractal @xmath0 inertial spacetime, is quasi - classical insofar as it is a one - clock model of a non - trivial global matter distribution. this distribution has the property of being irreducibly associated with clocks and rods in a fixed relationship with each other. this gives rise to what are conventionally called _ newtonian _ gravitation whereby a theory of gravitation effectively follows as a perturbation of that particular inertial space & time. since the distribution of particles in this matter distribution can not be accounted for by any ad hoc criterion of relativistic viewpoint, we interpret it as a classical representation of a material vacuum within which the particles ( or quasi - photons ) arbitrate between length and time in a way which is reminiscent of bondi s interpretation of @xma - it can thus be viewed as a ` ` conversion factor '' between length scales and temporal scales. a detailed application of this theory to the modelling of a sample of eight low surface brightness spiral galaxies, with accretion disks of varying mass and without a central bulge, has shown complete success. the rotational part of the power - law model is strongly supported, and the radial component of the model is also strongly supported : the data can be accurately modelled without the bar - like irregularities that are typically present in the discs of real galaxies, and without the periodic pattern of bars which are present in many spirals. in particular, the present theory predicts that on medium scales, the material distribution in the form of galaxies has vanishingly small accelerations and is distributed in a quasi - fractal form with _ index _ ( i.e., with increasing radius ). this is in very good agreement with what is actually observed in galaxy discs out to arms and beyond. finally, the theory is applied with complete success to the detailed modelling of an idealized spiral galaxy - defined to be one non - rotating, gas - rich galaxy, without acentral bulge. in this case, we show that the dynamical systems of the idealized spirals are very similar to those of milky way spirals, and that it has been successfully modelled by mond.

we present a study of the formation and evolution of disk galaxies using the cosmological evolutionary models of firmani et al. ( 1996 ), which are based on the inflationary cold dark matter ( cdm ) models. the gas disks are built - up in centrifugal equilibrium under the assumption of detailed angular momentum conservation into spherical virializing dark matter halos whose mass, the initial metallicity, and the primordial angular momentum are expressed through the spin parameter @xmath0. the star formation history ( sf ) is regulated by global gravitational instabilities and is modeled by an energetic balance of the turbulent gas. the b - band surface brightness ( b - v ) relation is assumed to be independent of mass. realistic dark halo structures are obtained by adopting general assumptions on the collapse of concentric shells given by the mah, and their ` ` relaxation '' into a stationary virialized structure. the model predictions, which go across the hubble sequence ( hs ), are discussed in detail. the main predictions of the models are : ( i ). the disks present exponential surface brightness profiles and negative radial b - van gradients. the scale lengths and central surface brightnesses are in agreement with the observations, including the lsb galaxies. the rotation curves are nearly flat up to the holmberg radius. ( ii ). bulges in galaxies with low and intermediate bulge - to - disk ( b / d ) ratios may be formed through secular dynamical evolution of the disks, whereas bulges with large b /d ratios could have been formed extra - medially from disks, through an early dissipative collapse and/or from mergers. further, the models predict a color - magnitude relation ( or equivalently the color - color relation ) that is close to the observed one, with a maximum correlation at the maximum brightnesses corresponding to the most active systems. the surface b - brightness and color - v color indexes decrease with the age of the system, until the present - day sf rates increase to the maximum rates observed at high redshifts. the most of the galaxies in the local universe are well reproduced, up to a few percent, in the models with a core ; the models without a core predict, on average, an increase by 0.08 ( 0.15 ) mag with respect to the present day rates.

we present new kinematic, spectral, and hydrodynamic observations of the collisional ring galaxy arp 10. the new spectroscopic data formed using the 6-meter telescope at the russian academy of sciences presents unprecedented spatial resolution ( @xmath0 ). we find that the inner 0.7 kpc and the outer 1.8 kpc contain signatures of an extended low surface density exponential stellar disk ( scale length 7.2 kpc ), plus a prominent bulge and a massive dark matter halo. from the spectral index modeling, we infer that the radius of the present h@xmath3 ring is located at about half the stellar disk radius. this location is in agreement with recent photometry of northern ring galaxies by @xcite. the gas distribution in the inner ring is typical for a large spiral galaxy. the existence of large rings is probably the result of gaseous density waves that propagate in the gas disk of the galaxy. outside the outer ring, the gas surface density drops significantly below the star formation threshold and the inner and outer rings therefore form at the right radius of peak stellar activity. the kinematics of the total stellar mass in the galaxy can be approximated by a superposition of four components : a slowly rotating disk, the radial expansion of the disk around the center, a secular decrease in the rotation curve with radius, and a vertical motion of the ionized gas. the model rotation curves show that the stellar disks expand radially and that the rotation velocity at large radii is declining at an increasing rate until the present day. the stellar line - of - sight velocity at radii larger than 10 kpc is consistent with the observed rotation curve and hence can not be accounted for by the model absence of a stellar bulge. hydrodynamics simulations are used to set constraints on the total masses of the stellar and dark matter components. the high metallicities inferred from the model spectral indices are in good agreement with the available values. this suggests that the metallicity gradients in the center ofarp 10 are small. a sequential triggering of star formation by expanding density waves in the disk is likely to leave behind a remnant stellar population, which is characterized by a radial gradient in the color - magnitude diagram.
the second solar spectrum is a formidable numerical problem that is considered as one of the most challenging tasks of solar and stellar polarimetry. it consists in calculating, for _ multilevel _ atomic models, the excitation and ionization states of chemical species of nuclei of given abundance that are consistent with the polarization properties of the radiation field produced by such species in any medium of given temperature, density, macroscopic velocity and magnetic field vector. the problem is motivated by the fact that the na region in the solar chromosphere contains a wealth of ` ` inexplicable '' spectral features, which are the signature of physical processes that are presently challenging physicists working in the field. this paper deals with the problem of finding the correct two - level model for the scattering line polarization problem taking into account both atomic polarization in both the upper and the lower levels of such line transitions. the atomic model is based on the irreducible tensor components of the atomic density matrix, which is the simplest and most suitable theoretical framework to work with. these self - consistent values for the density matrix elements and the corresponding emergent fractional linear polarization that results from this more correct treatment of atomic polarization are obtained by assuming the presence of a formidable ` ` ` source '' and ` ` sinks '' of polarization within the medium as well as from it. the standard theory is subjected to two objections : first, it is claimed to fail, due to the neglect of lower - level atomic polarization, thus establishing a new paradox : the ` ` mg solar paradox. '' secondly, i demonstrate that, contrary to some general beliefs, the density - matrix polarization transfer theory does have a suitable form for practical applications. to these ends, i consider here three types of line transitions in the ( 2x+1 ) transition : ( 1)sublevel transitions with @xmath0, ( 2)below - the - level transition lines, and ( 3)level transitions associated with fine structure lines of the spin - orbit ls coupling. the populations of the _ metastable _ levels of these lines are sensitive to the polarization and anisotropy of the underlying radiation field. i present the first results based on a one - level atom theory, including the depolarizing role of elastic collisions and magnetic fields. it leads to a coupled system of non - linear equations for the stokes parameters that can be solved exactly and efficiently by solving the transfer equations for any one or more isotropic rate rates from the upper to the lower level. the results show the robustness of this
the dynamics of a two - dimensional fluid is infinite dimensional and possesses an infinite number of invariants ; so, in order to make progress with a statistical mechanics approach one must extract a finite - dimensional model. such a model can not conserve all of the invariants of the original fluid system. therefore, it is important to determine which of these invariants are preserved, and how to incorporate them. the additivity of macroscopic invariants and statistical independence of subsystems are crucial properties in conventional statistical mechanics. in the lattice model, we show that the flow possesses a version of liouville s theorem, as recently discovered by miller. we define microscopic cells that are nearly statistically independent and consider only invariants that are additive over these cells. we also propose a natural coordinate system for describing inhomogeneous turbulence, a coordinate system that can be used to define statistically independent subsystems. this idea appears, at least implicitly, in the classical calculation of the specific heat of a solid, where the energy and vorticity are measured on a single oscillator. we test this idea quantitatively and compare its predictions with the experimental observations. our theory also indicates that equilibrium can be locally achieved in @xmath0 ( phases ), even though the system as a whole is turbulent and non - gaussian. from these tests we conclude that the proposition of additivity is conceptually secure, and that the temporal mean values of the streamfunction are a natural measure for it. in addition, we test the idea of using time intervals with nonlinear harmonically oscillators to define a simple definition of quasi - stationary stationary state ( sit ). this measure achieves approximate agreeement with the experiment, and is analogous to the analogous measure of enstrophy found in the henderson estimator for the energy distribution. * added july 10, 2010 * : in the context of statistical mechanics, we investigate the existence of stable self - organized steady states with large structures in strongly turbulent environments. we demonstrate that such states can be evanescently stable and possess additive invariants which are responsible for their existence. we argue that this theory is consistent with recent experiments on zonal flows in planets, the jet stream and the polar night jet, and the great red spot of jupiter. *
the open cluster trumpler2 is located in the rich cluster h and @xmath0. it is part of the usno - a 2.0 catalogue and was first catalogued in 2000 by jilinski et al.(2000 ). in that paper details of the selection procedure for the cluster members were described and the main results of the process were shown. at the present time when this paper is published ( 2002 ) the following background information is presented : * the processing of the data, corrections and new photometry in the photometric database were necessary for the photometry of stars in the area ccd - wise around the cluster center were done. the proper motions of the stars were determined by the line - method. accurate photometry for the stars was made by means of the padua isochrone and the two - color diagram was used for the selection of cluster members. * the cluster luminosity function and the turn - off point method were developed and illustrated with the use of the 2-discretized map of the cluster area. it was found that the cluster age is about 95 % for the main - sequence stars and about 80 % for those in the minor - sequence. in agreement with the age - luminosity relation of the milky way associations the results indicate that the mass function of the lmc is well described by the power law with 95 % confidence for good quality stars and for bad - quality stars by a factor of 2 or more. for the case of the 3d - diagram the best - fit power - law is not very good fit with a mass function, but it is close to the ` ` ` quintessence '' of the chabrier clusters. * keywords : * stars : clusters : individual ( h and ii ) ; clusters : general ; open clusters and associations : kinematics and dynamics ; field stars : statistics. * a first version of the paper has been delivered to astrophysical journal ( http://www.adelaide.edu/@xmath1physics/hot_stars/trumpler-2-chapter-1/ ). after a long process the present paper gives a historical perspective on the cluster and on the process of its selection.
we report on a long, thermonuclear burst observed from 4u 1820 - 30 by the rossi x - ray timing explorer. the super burst lasted for several hours with a peak isotropic flux of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath2 at a distance of 6.6 kpc. the spectral evolution of the burst is consistent with the release of energy at large densities in the star. assuming that the accretion rate onto the neutron star is driven by gravitational radiation, we derive black body flux, temperature, and radius for the burst. the radius required for the ignition of a carbon rich layer is about four times smaller than the inferred distance from the star, in agreement with previous studies of very long bursts from ks 1731 - 260 and serpens x-1. the occurrence of such a large rate of ignition is likely a consequence of dense accretion disk irradiation and the high carbon burning rate in the associated massive accretion clump. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 = cmr10 = cmti10 scaled 1 to 0pt#1 = cmbx10 scaled1 # 1#2#3#1, a&a, #2, # 3 # 1 ral - tr-99 - 036 + act-17 - 017 + october 1999 + * rxte commissioning group, astronomy and astrophysics department, university of california, berkeley, ca 94720 + usa dept. of astronomy & astrophysics, pasadena, ca 91109 - 8677, usa. + e - mail : raul.gallagher@sas.upenn.edu, gabriella.barrio@sapo.caltech.edu * keywords * : radiation mechanism : super - eddington burst. accretion, accretion discs, binaries : close stars : mass function.
we develop a general model for unwinding of a double - stranded nucleic acid molecule by a helicase motor. the helicase can be either in biochemical state 1 or 2. the allowed transitions between states and the corresponding reaction rates can be fully described by the master equation approach. a specific helicase, ns3 helicase of hepatitis c, is our focus. we derive an analytical expression for the unwinding velocity, which is essentially the hard - wall interaction potential in the bj model. this expression is then used to compare several key features of the experimental data of ns3 with the theoretical predictions. we first consider a special case which captures the flashing ratchet mechanism proposed for ns3. we calculate the total unwinding probability by summing the reaction rates of helicase and dsna. we then consider the restricted case where only the chemical state and the base - pair binding free energy can be changed by applied force. in this case, we find that the average speed of unwinding is relatively high, @xmath0, which may be because of the small energy cost of opening the na. we critically discuss the contradictory contradictory experimental results in the literature. there are several situations in which two experimental data are contradictory. there is one situation where a specific experimental data is contradictory to a whole lot of data, yet the rest of the literature treats the data as consistent. therefore, we take a break and study a few of the details of the experiments as well as the generic aspects of the model. we conclude that the different experimental results may be due to different interpretations of the particular data, which also may be reflected in the underlying theory.
quations ( qpos ) observed in the x - ray fluxes of accreting neutron stars are a general signature of the accretion flow around a compact object. based on the results of our mhd simulations of shear alfvn waves in a dipolar magnetic field, we investigate the nature of this qpo and its relation to other qpos. we find that such qpos are purely geometrical effects and are not driven by radiation pressure or radiation force. they are caused by the interaction of the flow with the compact object and the magnetic field of the star. we demonstrate that a magnetosphere of the size of the neutron star does not support a qpo because it supports a bunimovich flow. furthermore, a surface flow ploughs through the magnetosphere at a sonic speed, does nt interact with the field, and produces two simultaneous qpos with a roughly constant peak separation, moving up and down together in time. when the background flow is added, the qpos decay due to the breakdown of the resonant coupling. we present a model of this flow yielding two aurora lines. one of the lines crosses the line perpendicular to the ambient flow, while the other does not, because of the non - zero displacement of the electron in this case. we show that a magnetic field aligned along the field line can produce such aurora arcs. when this happens, there is a frequency gap between the two lines, resulting in a steeper ionization spectrum than observed in other sources. we also present a scenario in which a plume of infalling plasma draws matter from the outer magnetosphere, brings it to the center of the spinning neutron star, and excites two qpos simultaneously. this scenario is consistent with the observed qpos and can be seen as a common feature of magnetic neutron stars. a possible occurrence of more than one peak in the power spectrum is also discussed.
artist neural network models and connectionist artificial neural network - based approaches such as generalized linear models and feedforward multilayer backpropagation networks have been used to model the complex behavior of ecosystems of natural ecosystems. in most cases, however, these models have been built on the basis of artificial data sets which are inherently more complex and nonlinear than their general counterparts. as such, they are prone to be criticized as being case - specific ". to overcome this issue, nonlinear and/or non - parametric models are used to predict and forecast the state the system will occupy based on the new observations.artmap, a neighborhood - based statistical modeling technique, has been designed to perform this task efficiently. for different data sets investigated, a comparative study has been conducted comparing the performance of different statistical models in terms of predictive power, parameter dependence, and computational cost. the results show that for the time - independent data sets ( data sets 3 - 6 ), normalized k - nearest neighbor ( k - nn ) and linear and quadratic discriminant analysis ( artmap ) models, which are traditionally trained on the data of a single species, perform superior predictive performances compared to other statistical models. this is apparent both on training and test data sets. in general, artmap models seem to be more suitable for spatial data, such as habitat selection and species distribution, than the more dynamic alternatives such as connectionist neural networks ( glm ) or connectionist tensor - to - scalar neural network ( artm ). this result suggests that for larger data sets or with smaller temporal time - scales, modeling with simpler, connected models may be appropriate. however, the computational costs associated with artmap are comparably small compared to those of glm and other connected network approaches. based on these results, a more efficient method of spatial modeling is suggested, in which the number of data sets considered is reduced and the computational cost is made minimal. this method may be especially useful for complex spatially and temporally complex modeling.
we consider a conceptual model of a bi - quadratic or cooperative boolean network which has periodic orbits of length @xmath0. the network has a strongly connected digraph, and each node of its associated digraph has in- and outdegree of at most 2, and the indegree ( outdegree ) of every designated input ( output ) variable is zero. this network can be viewed as a counterpart of a turing machine that is shown to cyclically rotate the values of a number of variables, in such a way that this machine behaves like a counter. we prove the existence of a time - transposed copy of the system where every 1 has been doubled due to the feed - forward loop. in addition we show that the system also has a switch between mode and switching mode, and show that this can be interpreted as a non - monotonic component ( or negative feedback ) of the network. a while ago it was shown [ t. g. philbin, j. d. joannopoulos, and j. p. marangos, in _ a jel classification of computing functions _, ( cambridge univ. press, cambridge, 1995 ) ; phys. rev. * 87 *, 023510 ( 2002 ) ]. w. m. robertson, r. ritman, and h. zbinden. [ cols="^,<,^",options="header ", ] in this paper we carry out a study of cooperativity of many - body systems that are operating in mode. our purpose is to show that a system which is in a mode ( i.e. in which all three of these systems are cooperative can be extended to a mode, under certain conditions, to a form which is analogous to that in which the underlying system is also cooperative. this, in turn, implies that the output of such a system can be integrated into one which is cooperative. the work presented in this article is partially motivated by the design of an auxiliary boolean network @xcite with designated input and output variables, and also by a discussion of some related problems that are involved in constructing such a network under the restrictions of theorem [ theorem counterexample ].
the einasto dark matter halo has been proposed to describe the mass distribution of nearby and undisturbed galaxies in the lambda cold dark matter paradigm. it has a cuspy inner structure with an inner slope of @xmath0 and logarithmically diverges in mass at large radii. on the other hand, it has an isotropic outer density profile, like the pseudo - isothermal sphere ( iso ), which has no cosmological background. in this article we analyze to what extent the model can be used as a model for the mass decomposition of galactic rotation curves ( rcs ). we use a subsample of the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) sample and compare the properties of our sample halos to those of two - parameter navarro et al. ( 1996 ) models, the navarro, windhorst and white ( nfw ) model and the isothermal model. for the first time, we model the density profiles of galactic rcs with an einastic index that describes the shape of the central density profile. we find that the shape is stable to a constant value and provides a good fit to rcs even for halos with lower indices than are possible with the nfw and iso models. the biggest improvement is caused by allowing the parameter that shapes the radial behaviour of the mass density profile to have a different shape. in particular, for models with a fixed, small index, the mass profile as derived from the red clump locus closely matches that of the rcs. we also find a big improvement in the quality of fits to the rc as compared to fits with the usual nfw halo and iso halos, both in the sense that the fitted radii and profiles are smaller, which leads to a better fit of the rc and makes the rc a more universal tracer of the dark matter density distribution. we conclude that for a realistic rcs sample, the best fit model that can be obtained with the current data of the things sample for the large-@xmath1 accuracy level of several orders of magnitude in mass and in accuracy in a large fraction of the critical density profile turns out to be that of a cuspier, isothermal halo. this may explain the lack of cuspiness of observed rcs as a function of halo mass and the importance of dark matter halos in the modeling of galaxy rotation curves.
we present a photometric study of the photometric properties of a representative sample of 32 compact stellar objects in 32 luminous infrared galaxies with _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) @xmath0-acs i - band imaging. the galaxies were selected to span the different phases of interaction in the nearby universe, including the first contact, pre - merger, merger and post - merger phases of star formation. we have measured the projected morphology of the knots as a function of infrared luminosity ( and ), color, and, and have confirmed that the knots are in general compact, with a median size of 32 pc, being 12 % unresolved and a few extended, up to 200 - 400 pc, with these sizes significantly larger than those measured in less luminous interacting galaxies. the systems have a median age of 4.83 gyr and a median mass of 2.2 m@xmath1. the knots show similar properties to those of young stellar complexes in other nearby interacting galaxies, having similar radii, masses, colors, sizes and ages. moreover, compared with other young cluster complexes in the local universe, the mass of compact knots in highly luminous galaxies is at least a factor of four more than those in systems with lower infrared luminosities. the luminosity function of knots in ( u)lirgs is found to follow a power - law with an index of -2.4, in agreement with previous studies, and with that of ( local ) star - forming complexes. there is no evidence of a dependence on the color of knots, indicating that the amount of extinction in the systems is not a relevant factor in determining the star formation rate. the average age of the clusters ranges from 4 myr for low - luminous clusters to 15 myr in high - luminosity systems. the mass - radius relation for young clusters is not well defined, but we speculate that it may be a consequence of an isotropic gas - cloud coupling as in the case of giant molecular clouds. however, the knots in the most luminous ( _ ultraluminous _ ) infrared galaxies, which represent the most extreme cases of starbursts and interactions in our nearest universe, are not likely to be involved in the earliest stages of the interaction process.
we present the results of nine years of observations of the type-2 active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ngc 4258 with the and observatories. the coverage spans 2.2 years with a minimum separation of 0.05 years ( 3 weeks ). we have added four new epochs to the monitoring record of hard x - ray emission from 258, which now extends to 9 years. the five observations by themselves provide a much needed time series with high count rate and spectral resolutions that are unaffected by serious instrumental systematics. the time separations between epochs span 0.12 to 1.5 years. we detect variability on time scales of up to 30 % in the 0.310 kev count rate ( 19.4 kev ) and 510 kev flux ( 30 % ) over a time span of 9 years without any significant change in the underlying emission structure. we see no evidence for temporal variability in the 210 kev band. and observations with the mos instruments have detected an extension of the power - law component to 70 kev with no significant reflection component. we also detect a weakening of the fe k@xmath0 line compared to earlier observations. the line emission is presumed to be closely associated with the central engine and would be weakened by reflection within @xmath1 pc if it originates in the accretion disk. the and spectra are in agreement with and, except for the possible detection of weak absorption features at 6.4 and 6.9 kev. these features, which presumably would be caused by disk or outflow material, are inconsistent with the observed absorbing column if it were dominated by a single source. our best - fit models for the data are consistent with the range of models fit to data from other satellites, although the lack of any significant variability in either or both of these sources may indicate that the intrinsic variability in 258 is not correlated with the presence of a massive torus. the evidence does not support the suggestion that the outflow might directly power the maser emission. we present the first attempt to model the central emission of 258 as an absorbed power law, with the emission dominated by the optically thin soft thermal component. a soft power law model with a partially absorbed hard power law and a geometrically thick absorbing column fits the data well, supporting the assumption that the primary source of energy associated with 258 is a low - mass accretion flow ( lcrp ) with a large accretion rate and a relatively thin absorbing column. in particular, the time series of for
we study the influence of air bubbles on an asymptotic diffuse light field in the sea. in our recent paper [ [ flatau98a ] ] we showed that the vertical distribution of the diffuse attenuation coefficient in the near surface regime is important in understanding optical remote sensing. here we present a more detailed discussion of the dependence of bubble layer depth, wind gustiness, and microphysical properties of bubbles on the light field. we demonstrate that up to @xmath0 the downwelling radiation from a ` ` bubble '' layer can be efficiently scattered by air bubbles, leading to the formation of a stratus layer below the surface layer. the experimental data from the gulf of california and the east coast shelf are presented here. to verify predictions of the predicted average cosine, we model the distribution of surface photons for two different models of bubbles. one of the models has bubbles generated by breaking waves. the other is a model where air bubbles are generated by saturation and break at the surface. we find that in the first model the air bubbles remain stable in the water for several minutes. the upper limit of the experimental model ( ` ` no bubbles '' ) is derived for a three - layer system, including a deep homogeneous ocean composed of cdom, water, and water plus a small particle background consisting of both the same water and bubbles. in the second model we consider an ` ` infinitely '' deep integrable ocean composed not only of the same cdom and water but also with bubbles. the saturation layer is characterized by a bifurcated background of water with a petenheimer scattering radius. in this case the scattering radius is comparable to the height of the bubbles, but the fraction of unstable bubbles is larger. the intrinsic optical properties of water are quite similar to those of bubbles, suggesting that the bubbles are efficient scatterers. we finally discuss the climatology of bubble clouds and their influence on the oceanic hydrodynamics.
we present the results of our multi - wavelength analysis of the star forming complex sh2 - 252 ( @xmath0 = 1.04 ; b=+0@xmath7.48 ). the complex is powered by the central ionizing source of o6.5v type, hd 42088, which is a member of the gemini ob1 association. the spatial distribution of the young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the region is quite extensive, including the ionization front ( if ) at the eastern side and several sub - regions associated with the o and b stars. yso classification based on spectral analyses of more than 800 sources is in good agreement with the irac - four colour - colour diagram. based on the identification of the most probable class ii yso in the if with the help of irac, we suggest that the entire if is composed of a single yso. the presence of a class i yso, whose infrared colors are similar to the class ii ones, is a strong evidence that the if is an old co - cloud. however, we also find that a younger yso is located away from the if and is likely to be affected by the expansion of the region. the kinematics of the older yso indicate that it is the product of the gravitational instability in the collected material and not the result of external pressure. moreover, a similar type of yso has been identified at the interface of two expanding shells lmc4 and lmc5, where the gas has been swept up by the swept up neutral materials. the origin of the two shell fragments is unclear, though they might be part of the same cloud complex. we have also identified 12 ob stars of spectral type earlier than b8 in the main region and 5 ob stars and sub - clusters in the regions a, c, e, ngc 2175s and teu 136, which are some of the recent sites of star formation.
we present a sampling - based algorithm for finding perfect matchings in @xmath0-regular bipartite graphs. in order to compute an euler tour of the graph, we first establish the proportionate uncrossing theorem, which stipulates that every doubly stochastic matrix can be expressed as a convex combination of permutation matrices. then, we adapt and present known results about the importance of sampling in this problem, as well as a stronger analysis of the hopcroft - karp algorithm, and present an improved running time for the sampling scheme. as a result, the total number of vertices in the sampled graph reduces by a significant factor compared to the earlier estimate. informally, a relevant pair is one which is contained completely within a single piece in the decomposition, and is ` ` minimal '' with respect to that piece. thus any approach that reduces the size of the input biparite graph by sampling must ensure that edge - sets from every hall witness set are included, and hence that no graph presently contains a perfect matching. the benczr - karger sampling theorem utilizes these properties to show that it suffices to sample each edge from every ground - state witness set to obtain a perfect match. we apply this result to a general class of witness sets, and show that they may be used to determine the running time of the sampling algorithm. as another illustrative example, we consider the celebrated birkhoff - von neumann theorem, and also use it to establish a matching - based lower bound for the running times of our algorithm. we finally present and analyze a sampling subroutine that employs a union - bound over all cuts, and use this subrampling to get past the ` ` cut - barrier '', as quantified by the probability that a given pair of edges from a given witness set has at least one edge from that set. ( this is an interesting technical distinction, and may prove useful in other applications as well. )
we present a theoretical study of the effects of aqueous cooling on the mechanical properties of systems containing active colloidal particles. by introducing a non - volatile catalyst, we demonstrate that the drying process induces a competition between two characteristic stresses in the system : a macroscopic breaking stress which leads to cracks and a sliding stress that induces the formation of cracks. due to the increase in the glycerol concentration, the crack spacing is found to increase with the thickness of the film. consequently, the strength of the crack depolarization is determined by the competition between the competing stresses. based on this result, we propose a model to explain the mechanism for the slippening and find that it is the disorder of the liquid water distribution in the material that causes the cracks. the model suggests that the cracks are formed when a solid foot emerges from a drop while the center of the drop is still adhering to the substrate. we confirm the theoretical predictions based on the analysis of a cantilever experiment and also deduce the location of the instability and the critical thickness at which the instability is inhibited. we show that the crack spreading is optimal for a range of conditions, ranging from moderate to severe, with typical crack depths of @xmath0 m. the results can be used to describe potentially different materials where gel - like phases are present. in the last decade, a great deal of work has been focused on the interaction of soft solids with liquids and glasses, in order to understand how they behave as they are cooled through the thermal instability @xcite. a variety of simple models has been proposed to describe this process, among them are the superlatticeases reported for foams, foams and solutions in which the liquid is cooled gradually and then dried on a substrate with a high degree of glycerology. these models predict a dramatic change in the viscosity, eventually leading to a drastic reduction of the energy required to maintain the foams. however, the understanding of these systems is still at its infancy, with only a few works having been published in the literature. thus, the relation between the appearance of these models and the behavior of their materials is still an open issue. in particular, it is still unclear how the application of the various ingredients in these systems affects their properties, if any. in this work, we present a detailed study of a system containing a colloidal polymer ( usually silica ) by means of aylene - phthalocyanines ( also known as silica - silica g
we consider a class of models where the second and third generation squark and slepton masses are nonuniversal while the first two generation is conserved. we calculate the @xmath0-quark scattering cross section in this scenario. we point out that the current lep limits can be exceeded by factors of 3 or more if the lightest higgs mass is larger than 2 tev ( the limit of the tevatron ). we then find that the cross section of the standard model can be reduced further by including a light chargino component. s-6pt/ h-7.5pt/ # 1re#1 # 1im#1#2 # 1tr#1 = 11 # 1#2#3 nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( 19#2 ) # 3 # 1texas a & m university preprint ctp - tamu-#1
we perform a systematic study of strange particle production in proton proton(@xmath0 ) and nucleus(p, @xmath1 ) interactions at super proton synchrotron(sps ) cern energies using hijing(heavy ion jet interacting generator ) monte carlo model. the formulation of the hijing model uses the lund fritiof and dpm models phenomenology for soft nucleus - nucleus collisions and depends on the relative transverse momentum transfer of the processes. in particular, hadron - nucleus interactions in nucleus - nucleon collisions are decomposed into binary collisions involving in general excited or wounded nucleons. we study the average multiplicities for negative hadrons(#xmath2 ), negative pions(@xcite ), pion condensate(pion 2002 ) and neutral strange particles(pbpb 2002 ), compared with recent experimental data from na 35 collaboration. we also study the multiplicity ratios for hadronposon / nucleus(rhnn ) and pp(rhas / nucleon ). the results are compared to the data of hadron collider operating at the na 35 collider. we find that with a proton - nucleus interaction the average number of hadrons produced by each of the above particles is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the total hadron production. the decrease of the hadron multiplicity due to the growth of the diffusive parton spectrum, relative to the total one, can not reproduce the experimental data. the same result is obtained with the current data on pp / nucleus and pp - particle production. as well as the abundance of negative pion(rhn)/nucleon ratios, which indicate a relative increase of the matter - antimatter asymmetry with respect to the non - nucleonic solution. concerning the neutral strange production, we found that the main production mechanism of this particle is the minijet production with the total cross sections increasing with the number of inelastic cross sections within the eikonal formalism of hijing. an exact prescription for the strangeness enhancement is proposed based on the particular dependence of the cross sections for urhic. it is confirmed that hijing models including perturbative qcd processes in the pythia model can reproduce the data well. other models such as dual partons models, quark - gluon string models, and relativistic quantum molecular dynamics are not successful in reproducing the same data. # 1#2#3
we used the apex telescope to map the molecular line emission towards the protostellar core of the embedded class 0 protostar smm3, which is embedded in the filamentary orion b9 star - forming region. initial single - pointing observations showed that the _ p_-h@xmath2co line to be broad, and hence traced the warm gas component well. a rotational diagram was constructed to determine the rotational temperature of the broad - line component, which yielded a gas temperature of @xmath3 k. later, after accounting for the possible contribution from the various molecular species, we re - derived the gas temperature, density perturbations, and abundance ratio towards the core. the revised sed analysis suggested that the cold molecular gas might have had contributions from both thermal and non - thermal motions in the initial stages of outflow activity. the degree of deuteration of the n - bearing species nh@xcite derived from the new data was a factor of two higher than that derived from our previous study towards the eastern edge of the core, and the ammonia abundance is also found to be elevated. the methanol line we detected, with a fwhm of 10.98 km s@xday7, is broad, but its emission appears to be elongated on both the eastern and western sides of the line. the protrusion - like feature, observed in previous spitzer images towards the mid - ir core, is shown to be a solid, but non - flared feature. the chemical composition of the gas, derived from both the broad and the narrow lines, is consistent with the estimates of a so - called ` ` jeans - type '' fragmentation scenario. we also detect a weak broad shock emission, which shows a strong correlation with the high - velocity gas. the estimated gas temperature and envelope mass, as well as the position angle of the peak emission, are similar to those derived towards the class 0 core of iras 05399 - 0121/smm1.

we present a method for calculating observables in quantum field theory. we use a fully differential basis set to diagonalize the hamiltonian. this diagonalization includes the hermitian conjugate annihilating a free particle as a special case. the results show that the vacuum energy satisfies a simple power law scaling with the size of the basis set. furthermore, the contribution of the free vacuum decreases with increasing the dimension of the system. the free two - particle states dominate the wavefunction around the center of momentum. we find a strong peak at the fiftieth free - particle product state with two particles. as a result, the hubble function falls with increasing dimension. various experimental signatures of quantum nature have been proposed over the past decades. in order to understand what is observed in a specific situation, it is often useful to construct generic models. the most useful model comes from a pure scalar field theory with a quartic coupling and a parity symmetry. in this model, if we take a look at the one - particle state, we will notice that even though the eigenstates of the lagrangian are completely determined by the parity symmetry, the states with an even number of free particles will not decouple. this is because the vacuum is not completely free. therefore, in this kind of model, the only way to calculate observables is to use the parameterization. an effective parameterization is the free energy. this free energy can be obtained from various means including the intensity of the source or the spectrum of fluctuations. for example, the dynamical amplitudes of harmonic oscillators can be calculated from the free - energy amplitudes built from three - dimensional electron - positron annihilation results ( see weinberg @xcite ). another parameter that is entirely dependent on the geometry is the cutoff on energy. we can see that there are different parameterizations for this process as well. the present work will provide a complete and general description of this process.
the task of identifying the driver nodes on a network is mapped to the problem of finding a maximum matching of the network @xcite. as in most networks, the three relevant correlations coexist to some degree, highlighting the role of network correlations in controllability. we study the effect of three topological characteristics : clustering, modularity and degree correlations, finding that changes in the clustering coefficient and the community structure have no systematic effect on the minimum number of driver nodes @xmath0. in contrast degree correlations showed a robust effect, whose magnitude and direction depends on the type of correlation. our results not only offer a new perspective on topological properties, but also raise questions about the optimal network configuration to minimize the number of necessary driver nodes. how do real networks influence the above mentioned parameters? we use self - organized mathematical systems to study the impact of correlations, and of the structural properties not captured by the degree sequence. we randomize the network, keeping its degree sequence unchanged, and calculate the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) per connected node. we compare the results to analytical predictions on several real networks. our goal is to understand the origin of these deviations, and the degree to which network correlations can explain the observed s/ n. we consider networks of p2p internet ( gnutella filesharing clients ) or scale - free degree distribution ( random network ). the networks of electric circuits, metabolic networks, neural networks, power grids and food webs display significant out - in and in - in correlations, consistent with the observations. we also show that in the absence of degree correlations ( neutral case ) the _ total _ degree correlation coefficient may increase, displaying the corollary that stronger correlations may have a stronger impact. finally we emphasize that our results are valid for networks with a given degree distribution, showing that these numerical and analytic results are qualitatively explained.
recent claims for evidence of non - negligible e2 contribution in inclusive measurement of an asymmetry by the gsi2 collaboration have been made in the literature. we demonstrate that these claims are based on misrepresentation of data and a misunderstanding of the cd method. to clarify this misunderstanding we refer the reader to a recent physical review letter by esbensen, bertsch and snover on external capture and show that the riken1 data are explicitly negative as predicted for energies below 100 kev. in such a case the logarithmic derivative s/s(0 ) is shown to be an invariant. at higher energies the observed slope ( s = ds / de ) for the over all slope is an artifact of the d / s ratio. we exclude the same energy region due to 632 kev resonance and extrapolate 17 values of cd data. the result obtained is in remarkable agreement with that of the seattle group if one omits the energy dependent d - wave component. but the so called ` ` scale independent slope parameter '', b = 0.51 0.06 @xmath0 with = 1.1, is clearly excluded from the fit. furthermore the fit parameters ` ` a '' and ` ` b '' have no physical meaning and are not related to the anc of the wave function. in particular the b - slope parameter extracted from both dc and cd data in the energy range of 300 - 1400 kev is negative ( i.e. the theoretical predictions are in disagreement with the data ). the discrepancy is by as much as five sigma and there is not a single measured data point of the bochum group that agrees with a chi - square fit of all the predicted b - wave components. we conclude that the measured dc slope is likely to be higher than the predicted. but there is no direct way to test the validity of the prediction by a direct comparison between measurements on dc and other experimental quantities. we briefly discuss the implications of our results for the phenomenological models of dc.
we present an analysis of the angular momentum distributions of early - type galaxies in the nearby universe, based on a new synthesis of modern photometric and kinematic data. we first confirm the basic results from f83, extrapolating the rotation to larger radii than was possible in f83. we find that every galaxy can be considered as a linear combination of a disk and a bulge, with each of these components following a characteristic scaling relation. in this idealized model, one of our goals in this paper will be to include observational results for sa and s0 galaxies in this diagram for the first time, to see if such systems fill in the gap ( if any ) between earlier and later types, and if bulges and disks are homologous enough to explain the we set out to explore the preceding questions and issues. we present a methodology for careful estimation of in various types of galaxies and observations, presenting the details of its derivation given in appendix [ : form ]. our updated analysis of these trends in a large sample of galaxies follows, with the observational ingredients and their inter - correlations described in section [ : data ], and the full results presented in the appendix. we confirm and extend the ` ` missing '' in ellipticals found in previous studies. according to our estimates, the new observations tend to show outer rotation profiles that _ decline _ rather than rise the fitted slope for the ellipticals, but is significantly offset to lower by a factor of @xmath0 3.4 ( @xfig1 0.5 dex ). another observational finding from this analysis is that the residuals of the specific angular momenta of galaxies from the mean relation are not simply lognormal. the best match to the data is achieved when they are roughly divided into spirals and ellipticals. these empirical findings, strong correlations between galactic angular momentum, morphology, and bulge fraction stand out as fundamental ingredients for any successful theory of galaxy formation, and may be direct observational evidence for the return of stellar angular momentum in galaxies.
the bose - einstein condensation takes place in a one - dimensional homogeneous bose gas when the on - axis density is larger than a critical value obtained with standard evaporative cooling techniques. we show that the reduction of the temperature and of the density in the phase - space density necessary to reach quantum degeneracy of an atom is possible. we also discuss the equivalent problem of a particle in two - dimensional space with the hamiltonian. the description of the dynamics of a many - body system is one of the most challenging problems in modern physics. it has to be faced with the fact that a finite number of particles is not enough to make a quantum state, e.g. in the thermodynamical limit. even if such a system exists in the first place it is not easy to characterize it in the presence of large numbers of particles. the most simple situation to consider is that of a superfluid in thermal equilibrium. in this case one does not have to worry about the finite size of the superfluid. an easy way to characterize the fluid in a superposition of superfluids is to conduct measurements on the intensity of the field. this can be done in a very simple way : by comparing the intensity fluctuations of the gas to the classical harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath0. recently, the separation of the two types of field has been established @xcite. the first type of measurement is the intensity fluctuation of the atomic field, which is caused by the change in the direction of propagation of the magnetic field. the second type of correction is to the dispersion of the atoms, which results in an increase of the chemical potential. such a correction is not carried out in experiment. the reason why it is difficult to calculate the number of atoms is because of the strong interactions among the atoms. these strong interactions destroy the possibility to perform a full transverse oscillation before experiencing a collision. in the limit of very small interactions the reversal of the initial intensity fluctuations is sufficient to evaporate the atom, leaving behind a single highly excited atom. this is the situation considered in this paper, i.e. for the sake of concreteness we assume that the atoms are in the transversally excited zeeman sublevels. we first look for an exactly solution of the boltzmann equation in such a setup, adapting to our geometry the recently developed model of interacting bose gases. we then perform a numerical simulation of the full hydrodynamic evolution of the model. results show that in our model transverse bose
background : : it is generally accepted that the main stellar mechanism synthesizing the _ p _ nuclei involves mainly photodisintegrations, dominantly ( @xmath0,n ) reactions on preexisting, neutron - rich _ s _ and _ r _ seed nuclei. however, recent experiments indicate that the h - f model may slightly overestimate the _ n _ capture width at low energies. thus, data are needed to confirm the pseudoscalar - to - proton ratio in the astrophysically relevant range. purpose : : astrophysical measurements are urgently needed to fill in the missing nuclear abundances. the reaction flow for the production of heavy nuclei in a massive star plasma is strongly dependent on the ( ` `0,@xmath2 ) capture width in the stellar plasmas. it is understood that purely theoretical calculations based on the hauser - feshbach model can not provide the required information for astrophysical reactions in a stellar plasma, involving a large number reactions on nuclei which are in thermally excited states. therefore, we have performed a significant experiment : the measurement of the x - ray capture rate for reactions involving n and z ions. method : : the activation method has been applied for the first time to this problem. the resulting cross sections are presented in [ sec : exp ]. comparison to predictions is shown and the implications for the astrophysical rate are discussed ; conclusions : : our experimental database reaches a relatively low level of accuracy, which is a clear sign of the uncertainty in the calculation of the nuclear rates. the number of discrete levels close to this energy is quite different from the predicted number. this is due to an incomplete level scheme. in the given states, there are only states with higher spin from four rotational bands, therefore rates can be converted to the reverse one below the fifth one. the impact of the low - spin states is even more pronounced. amount of extrasolar nuclear states included in the recent study does not affect the conclusions in this respect.
the swimming and advection of swimmers by ambient fluid are central to the evolution of eukaryotic cells. despite their importance, models and simulations have never been capable of reproducing the large - scale organization and double - circulation that are observed in experimentally confined suspensions of bacteria. in this paper, we describe a minimal model and simulation method for micro - swimmer suspensions that includes direct cell - cell, cell - fluid and swimmer - generated fluid flows. in the absence of hydrodynamics, the swimmer motion is directly coupled to the fluid dynamics. in periodic domains, however, the long - range hydrodynamic interactions are crucial to reproduce the swarming state and dynamical behavior that is observed in experiments. these simulations show that under circular confinement, although swimmers swim in the same direction as the fluid, the cell alignment depends on the direction of motion of the swimmers. swimmers in a disk - shaped position are shown to push fluid backwards in response to the pressure exerted by the nearby swimmer. the magnitude of this pressure - induced motion is comparable to that predicted by active matter theories. in addition, a swimmer locomotion has been found to have spiral order in drops with diameter @xmath0. while these results are in qualitative agreement with experiments, they disagree with the predictions of simple active matter models, suggesting that additional processes are needed to explain the experiments. while swimming is the fundamental activity of most bacteria, it has been observed that in a very small class of bacteria the swimming motion is dominated by the advective fluid flow associated with the swimming of the flagella @xcite. in a simple model for self - guiding swimmers, the motion is self - propelled by steric forces generated by the fluid flow they create. taken together, these theoretical models may explain the organization and spatial order of bacterial suspensions, in particular the formation of spiral vortices, in fig. 1a. ( b ). ( c ) examines the organization of a single swimmer in a vortex state, in which the cell vertical direction is parallel to that of the fluid circulation. ( d ) investigates the nature of collective swimming by considering a restricted group of ellipse - shaped swimimmers. ( e ) simulates the motion of a two - dimensional fluid flow in two dimensions. ( g ) estimates the order of the swimmingmer motion in the vortex state. ( [ xdot]-[pdot ] ) compares simulation results to the experimental data. in particular, the simulations reproduce qualitatively the large
we study the x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath0 ) relation of galaxy clusters and show its connection with the cluster core radius and the cooling time. by correcting the emission - weighted temperature for small - core clusters with the universal temperature profile suggested by @xcite, we find that the bolometric luminosity normalized by the temperature dependence of the central temperature is constant within the data scatter. this strongly suggests that the rate of thermal energy loss is almost constant in the core region after the onset of radiative cooling. according to the quasi - hydrostatic cooling model, the temperature decreases towards the center and approaches a constant value with the increase in the mass inflow rate from the outer region. we thus suggest that the energy dissipation in the inner part of the cluster is controlled by cooling and is expected to be little different from the flow in the outer part. from the comparison with the self - similar distribution of the core temperature measured with the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ satellites, we also suggest that a central concentration of the gas may be linked to the energy loss. in addition, we derive the luminosity-`ambient temperature'relation and find a slight trend for merging clusters to segregate from regular clusters on their planes based on the different level of cooling and icm density structure. we also confirm the previous suggestions that the temperature decline is mild in small core clusters and suggest that it might be connected with the thermal evolution of the icm. finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the cold gas in the cores of clusters and propose a model to account for the cooling and inverse compton cooling observed in the literature.

we present observations of the circumstellar envelopes of fourteen deeply embedded young stars at submillimeter wavelengths, obtained with the owens valley millimeter array and the infrared space observatory. the bulk of the objects is optically thick in the bright mid - infrared sources but thin in the others, which may be due to dispersal of hot dust. the envelopes are separated into a ` ` hot core '' and an ` ` ultracompact region '' for which @xmath0 is derived from the size of the carbon - oxygen emission line emission. in the hot core, the dust and gas are well mixed, with a typical temperature of several k and an average abundance of saturated carbon - bearing molecules of about 0.1 g@xmath1. the temperature of the ` ` cold '' region is significantly lower than that found for low - mass objects, possibly due to the suppression of dust and molecular gas there. the density structure is constrained by the emission lines of and. from the column densities, we derive a relationship between the optical depth and the radius of the driving source. this relation is consistent with the virial theorem and has no dependence on the absolute luminosity or the distance of the sources. in most sources, the envelope column density is significantly smaller than the value expected from thermal pressure considerations, which suggests that the outflow is directed along the line of sight rather than perpendicular to the stellar rotational velocity. a major source of uncertainty is the integrated power law brightness of the cores, which is only marginally correlated with the column density. our results strongly suggest that depletion and thermal desorption are the processes responsible for the dynamical time scale of molecular outflows after chemical reactions lock up almost all of the available carbon, but not to density itself. the sources studied in this paper are typical of deeply embedded massive young stars, which emit with high luminosity in the mid- and far - infrared, have large black holes, and are supported against collapse by winds and outflows.
the spectra of seven luminous galactic o stars, for which radiatively driven winds are known to be responsible for their very early spectral type, have been analysed by means of non - lte, plane parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. three stars, hd15570, j18521680 and hd5689, are analysed in the same way. we have also made a systematic study of the effects of the different model parameters ( line - blocking and sphericity ). it has been shown that line blocking has to be taken into account when analysing very hot stars, in plane parallel as well as in spherical models with mass - loss. it is also shown that the spectral - line diagnostics are affected by changes in the level populations of he and c. in particular, the blue wing of the line at @xmath040100 is seen to have a weaker correlation with the mass than that of h@xmath1, whereas the red wing is well described by the well - known zenithal curve. further, it is shown that different mass loss rates are required for helium to remain stable in the presence of evaporation. these results will help us to understand the origin of the so called stellar mass discrepancy, which is actually a problem of the stellar classification. we will discuss this problem in the future. as a by - product of this analysis, we have derived stellar masses for the three stars for which well measured spectroscopic radial velocities are available. mass derived from the analysis of the spectrum is shown to be in agreement with both theoretical and experimental predictions ( see, e.g., auer & mihalas @xcite ). the obtained stellar masses are then used to disentangle effects related to the different methodologies used to analyse the spectra, and to obtain a new determination of the eddington limit. we find that the new stellar masses do not significantly change the previously established values for the mass of the central star. we also show that the use of different wind diagnostics has made a complete mismatch between the mass and photospheric helium abundances previously found in the literature, and still present in the new analysis.
we present the maps and analysis of stellar and ionised - gas kinematics and absorption line - strength indices of a representative sample of 24 sa galaxies in the nearby universe. the maps, obtained with the low spatial resolution mode of the integral - field spectrograph ` sauron `, provide a @xmath0 field - of - view field of view ( fov ) of approximately 5, 4, and 4@xmath1 square degrees. we combine these observations with previously published high spatial resolution maps of the s0 and e and s0 galaxies in our sample to derive the kinematic major axes and velocity dispersions in the vicinity of their central stars. despite the small sample size, the resulting maps and spectra contain some interesting differences between the two sets of data. in 12 of the sample galaxies we observe regions of very high stellar velocity dispersion, in addition to a prominent dust lane in the centre of the galaxy. we interpret these features as signatures of an interacting stellar disc, in agreement with previous work in the literature. in six cases the dust lane is spatially extended, and in three cases it appears to be completely absent. we attribute these phenomena to triaxial rotation in a rotating disc co - rotating with respect to the stars. in four out of the eight galaxies for which we detect strong emission in our _ spitzer _ images, we measure very strong / emission ratios indicative of a nuclear stellar disc. the / ratio is similar across the main disc of all galaxies, except for ngc4698, where the ratio is lower. we find an anti - correlation between the and emission - line ratios that indicates the presence of a circumnuclear star - forming ring in one of the galaxies. the luminosity - weighted mean star formation rates of our sample galaxies are approximately one order of magnitude lower than derived for the sample as a whole. this is likely due to the central star formation rate, which is low at the level in these low - inclined galaxies.

we investigate mass models for the milky way and the andromeda galaxies based on the standard paradigm for disk and dark matter halo formation in a cold dark matter cosmology. we merge classical dynamical modeling of disk formation with current cosmologically - based models of dark halos and disk formation. we divide the mass of the galaxy into two components : a dark halo component and a summed - up baryonic component. we use a semi - analytic model of the galactic bulge / bar to confront our observational data which is motivated by the @xcite fast rotating bar model of both galaxies. the amount of dark matter that can be fit by the models is found to be in agreement with numerous observational constraints including, the stellar kinematics, the surface density of stellar components, the vertical force at 1.1 kpc, the rate of gas accretion and the stellar velocity dispersion in the solar neighbourhood, and recently, the very low microlensing events in the inner @xmath0 of the m31 galaxy. the models also have a consistent treatment of adiabatic contraction of the dark matter and the baryons, which we find to be important for the inner part of the halo. we find that the density of the total dark matter can deviate significantly from the original ( unmodified ) dark matter profile in high surface brightness galaxies because of the strong compression during the barkonic collapse. given the coupling of the inner and outer parts of halo, it is necessary to repeat the mass modeling of the stellar systems including a self - consistently consistent model for the distribution of the light from the baries. in the process, we ensure that the polarization axis remains ellipsoidal, i.e., does not show any wiggles or features corresponding to the transition from a fast rotating dark matter component to another slow rotating bar. the bar model is in good agreement with the current cobe data on the gas dynamics and stellar radial velocities. we also find that if the mw halo is typical among galaxies that form in dark matter halos of a given mass, then the predictions of the standard cosmological theory must be tested to some degree using our parallel study of the nearby galaxy m31. this would include the observation that there are not as many sub - halos as predicted in the standard model of galaxy formation. the general agreement between the models and the data is very good on scales less than a few kpc. on larger scales, the models encounter problems
on search, amoeba - based, non - concave maximization technique for finding the most probable distribution of loads in a multi - dimensional power network, that meets the load - shedding constraints. we formulate the problem in terms of the error - surface, where the local maxima of the load distribution over the network are the so - called instantons, and find that the probability of occurrence of some instantons is significantly smaller than the corresponding value at the normal operational point. with the help of a general - purpose optimization technique, specifically the downhill simplex ( or ` ` instanton '' ) method, we search for a distribution of the instanton maxima according to specified criteria in the space of demands. we observe that the instantons are well - localized on the grid and that the critical instanton value ( the ratio of the instantaneouson probability to the overall available capacity ) is very close to the critical value for the system. we also find that removing the dc conditions on the transmission phases from the sat configuration of the network leads to a significant reduction in the expected number of problematic instantons and to the emergence of the unsat regime. these findings are precised from the analysis of a simple triangle - grid example. we view this work as the beginning of exciting further exploration of the power network stability along the following lines. = 1 load shedding, load distribution, parallel execution, fault - tolerance, robustness of power networks. # 1 # 1#1 # 1 ( # 1,#2 ) # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4 _ # 1 _ * # 2 * * instantons as a factor * * in power networks * + * instanton search * * * as a method for optimal electricity generation * * s. j. chen@xmath0, * * l. zhang * * c. f. qian * * department of electrical engineering, peking university of beijing, beijing 100080, china + @xmath1e - mail : qiancp@bac.pku.edu.cn, h. yu. liu@iphy.ac.cn it is well known that in a power - supply network ( e.g. the power - distribution system ), some kind of load shedding is unavoidable. the load shedding can be represented as a top - heavy " load shedding state, i.e. with a large number of unstable links potentially saturated at any instanton, and thus pose a greater threat to the
recently, chor, goldreich, kushilevitz, and sudan @xcite proposed a new method of coded private retrieval for the purpose of fast or private retrieval. they constructed coded schemes for a distributed storage system by replicating the database on several servers that do not communicate with each other. the goal of their approach is to ensure that each batch of @xmath0 bits from the database can be recovered by read back at most two of the servers. in this paper we study the tradeoff between storage overhead and communication complexity of coded pir codes. in particular, we ask, what is the price that one has to pay for reducing the storage overhead of a pir scheme in order to obtain fast and private retrieval of a data item from a database? in answer to this question, we expand the analysis to information - theoretic pir codes with all the parts of the database in distributed storage. we provide a general construction of coded schemes that can be used to achieve any pir protocol with minimal storage overhead. as a first step, we extend the analysis of an existing linear pir protocol to binary linear schemes. then we include a new construction of a non - binary linear pir scheme, which we call a _ coded_pir, with a special property that we call _ local recoverable pir ( lrc ) codes_. in this construction we restrict the number of bits that need to be read back by each server and make sure that every symbol from each codeword can be individually recovered, while restricting the size of the sets of the recovery bits. we show that for a large number of parameters, including the sizes of the codes and the amount of data needed to implement it, the parameter space is very limited. for the case of nonbinary alphabets, we establish a _ locality requirement _, i.e., for every message bit the code can be fully recovered at any point of time, provided that the parameter of the code is small. we prove that, for a domain with any size ( e.g. a number of processors ), the optimal Pir code is the one that reads out from the domain with the least storage cost, and not necessarily the best possible. finally, we briefly discuss extensions of our results to other data storage paradigms such as batch codes, to robust pir, and to data recovery with multiple servers. = -1
the existence of the uv - rising branch in elliptical galaxies was initially proposed to be due to the presence of old, cool stars. greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) explored a variety of possible candidates produced by the evolution of low mass stars ( single and in binary systems ), including p agb, hhb, and post - agb stars. subsequently, foc imaging and fos spectroscopy of the central regions of the ellipticals ngc 1399 and ngc 4552, the bulge and the disk of the ngc 2681 spiral, were obtained. in this paper we first summarize the observational results of gr90, and discuss the theoretical developments following 1990. the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from iue covers the full range of temperatures ( 0.00025000 k ). the ultraviolet ( 1550v ) flux ratio is strongly correlated with metallicity ( @xmath0 4.5@xmath1 2.5 times greater than the optical one ), as in the bluest known ellipticals. in order to translate the observed sed into an estimate of the total flux, a formula was developed, which turns out to be remarkably similar to the one derived from simple energetic arguments based on the fuel consumption theorem. subsequently we found that the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of the candidate hot stars all look similar, and that their _ individual _ lfs are consistent with the lfs of the observed stars. on the other hand, we had serendipitously found yet another way of gathering information on the central black hole demography in galaxies, from the analysis of the _ lyman limit hut _ emission lines in the iue spectrum. this provides additional constraints on the assumed model for the central source. the main conclusions of this paper are the following three. \(1 ) for old stellar populations in ellipticals, the main uv component can be attributed to moderately hot stars with temperatures in the range 20000250000 k. assuming that this is the characteristic uv spectrum for giant ellipticals the hot stars responsible for the emission from ellipticals like ngc4649 should statistically burn at least @xiff0 0.01 gb of equivalent hydrogen. \(2 ) if the main sources of uv photons are young, with stars evolving through the agb+post agb evolutionary phase at the end of their lives, and then spending only a fraction of their evolution on the red side of the horizontal branch, then the contribution of such stars to the
we have carried out calculations of the cno isotopes from first and second dredge - up in stars of mass 0.8 to @xmath0, evolving them self - consistently from the pre - main sequence through the first helium shell flash ( for low and intermediate mass stars ), to the point where the program failed due to core helium burning during the subsequent higher mass stellar evolution ( for higher mass stars, extra mixing becomes important ). the observed ratios of and as a function of stellar mass are generally consistent with our ` ` evolving rgb '' cbp models. the [ c / fe ] ratios are more uncertain, especially for globular cluster stars, but overall are in agreement, or at least slightly higher, than previously reported. in field stars, the predicted ratios are somewhat lower than the observed ones, probably due to uncertainties in the stellar rotation rates and cno abundances. in globular clusters, the same trend should persist until the most massive stars reach the asymptotic giant branch, at which point the convective envelope deepens again, and the carbon - rich products of main sequence nucleosynthesis are no longer retained by the star. thus, the observed reduction in in low mass stars is probably not due to extra mixing. our models also suggest that the degassing of the red giant branch caused by early mass stars could have been much deeper than previously thought, and that extra mixing might have had in earlier stages of evolution. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 * # 2 # 3 _ the messenger _ # 1, # 2 * # 3 # 4 _ astron. nach. # 10. _ editor _ _ e - mail : _ smith@astrosc.nrh.ac.uk _ astrophysics laboratory, university of central florida, orlando, fl 32813 usa.
we present the initial results of a two - year, high - angular resolution ( @xmath0 ) proper motion study of the galaxy s central stellar cluster, conducted with the keck i facility near - infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1993 ) at the w. m. keck 10-meter telescope. in our first paper, we identify 11 sources associated with the putative central black hole, sagittarius a *, with velocities measured to be within 0.015 pc of the nominal position of sgr a *. with a photometric resolution of 005, these stars are moving under the influence of a potential generated by at least a few million solar masses of dark matter. combining this with other sources detected in the nirc, we generate a shift - and - add map to explore the distribution of mass in the cluster. the resulting maps place several constraints on the black hole hypothesis : the volume - averaged mass density exceeds that inferred so far for the central region of any galaxy, and the enclosed mass is several orders of magnitude larger than that inferred for any compact, single - cluster dark matter solution. two of the more intriguing results are that _ ( i ) _ the stellar velocity field is isotropic within a radius less than 0.1 pc, and suggests that the stars are all moving in a potential dominated by a single massive component, and _ ( ii ) _ there is no evidence for a central bias " between the velocity dispersion and the baryonic component of the underlying dark matter distribution. under the assumption that the dark matter and stellar plasma are co - spatial, we estimate that the enclosed dark matter is composed of 8 - 12 million particles and is gravitationally dominated. if we assume that the luminous stellar halo is a superposition of a diffraction - limited core and an extended dark halo, then the implied mass to light ratio is at least 10 times higher than has been observed in any other galaxy other than our galaxy, raising the possibility that the nucleus of our own milky way may also be superimposed on a much more massive black hole.
we study leptogenesis of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe by means of the seesaw mechanism in the presence of a slightly broken @xmath0 lepton number symmetry within both the supersymmetric ( susy ) and the non - superstring - isothermal ( 2rhn ) model. we start from the mass basis for the two right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos corresponding to the lightest active neutrino mass eigenstates, and study the model with only two rh neutrons. we find a simple parametrization for the dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the initial number and on the strength of the washout terms, which is essentially independent of the initial conditions as well as of any previously generated asymmetry. in the case of lepton - flavor violation, we also constrain the size of the possible scale and the number of the breaking parameters. proceeding analytically, we obtain the maximal possible tuning parameters of the symmetry breaking mechanism. we show that, if we take into account the large washout parameters, the scales of the convexities and of the associated mixing angles are not accessible at the lhc colliders. in addition, we find that it is not possible to make a significant modifications of the model parameters in the limit of low - energy lepton flavor effects, even taking into account majorana phases. the main consequence of our results is that leptogene is incompatible with the possible observation of rh neut -inos at future colliders, as it has been shown in previous studies. c i u # 1 # 1#2#3phys. rev. lett. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1_#1#2 # 3nucl. phys. b ( # 1 ) # 2(#2)_#3 phys. rept.*#1 * ( # 2 ) # 3(#1)_v_#2(#3)_phys. rept. * c i # 1*(# 2 ) _ v^2_v^2_(#3 ) _ sov. j. phys. jetp lett. _ # 1, _ # 2 _, # 3 ( # 4 : # 1)_ibid. _
the masses of protostars inferred from millimetre dust emission are typically small compared to the masses required for core - accretion to build the sun s giant planets. there is a ` missing mass'problem at these early stages, if the small dust masses at the class 0 stage represent a true initial mass reservoir for planet formation. the solution to this problem is of considerable importance, particularly if the outer radius of the protostar is much larger than expected. although dust masses can be estimated from the wavelength of peak emission, the latter comes from modelling of grain properties and may be uncertain if some of the dust has evolved into observable forms ( * anywhere from small pebbles up to planetesimals ) but the gas is still in the disc. the true disc masses could, therefore, be higher if a more appropriate gas - to - dust ratio were used. similarly, the disc mass estimates are even more uncertain if the initial reservoir of dust is underestimated. whatever the case, the resulting total disc masses are likely to be substantially higher than the masses derived directly from the observed dust, confirming that there is indeed a discrepancy within the available data. there are various theories for the origin of the missing mass, including that the disc properties are affected by a combination of gravitational instability and photodissociation. however, the evidence indicates that while the discs are unstable to fragmentation at the current estimated masses, they should by themselves be very massive, with masses from 10 to 100. the discs also have a range of temperatures, suggesting that in the absence of a significant source of non - thermal dust, most of the central material is condensed into compact objects. it is likely that these compact objects are the precursors of the planetary cores. the presence of a sufficient amount of dust around the central object can also help to accelerate the star s growth and help to produce planets. some models predict the formation of at least two mmsn, and perhaps as many as four if the dust masses are as large as the current estimates.

we investigate the effect of galaxy halos and voids on the distribution of magnifications of light rays through a @xmath0cdm swiss cheese cosmology and derive analytic results for the lensing convergence in two simple models of large scale structure. we consider cosmological models where at large scales matter evolves to cluster on the edges of spherical voids. one effect which is important is the clustering of halos, that is, the correlations between the locations of different halos. while it would be more realistic to include only the effects of clustering, our simple models should capture the essence of the properties of the source of cosmic acceleration. we use an algorithm to compute the probability distribution of distance modulus shifts for a variety of different void models with realistic density distributions. we find that the mean dispersion of the magnitude shift due to gravitational lensing due to voids with a shell thickness of about 1 mpc is @xcite with 90 % of the void mass on the shell today. using a simple model for a comoving void of radius r = 35 mpc, we study the behavior of the following properties : ( 1 ) the underdense interior has an nfw density profile, ( 2 ) the halos are smoothly distributed with no branching points, ( 3 ) the mean and standard deviation of the magnification distribution are similar, ( in agreement with analytic results ), ( 4 ) the number of halo intersections is less than 1 in each of the two models, but depends strongly on the model quality factors, ( 5 ) the redshift dependence of the standard deviation is weakly dependent on the galactocentric radius of the halo, ( 6 ) the inner halos contribute less than 0.1 magnitudes to the mean shift of the magnifications, and ( 7 ) the bimodality in the magnitude distribution of both models is due primarily to the inner disc structure of the spherically symmetric galaxy halo. these results are in good agreement with observations.

we compute the exclusive @xmath0 decay rate governed by the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) with minimal flavour violation in the presence of higgs bosons, taking into account the experimentally observable decay branching ratios and the corresponding forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetries. in the framework of the type - ii two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) and a supersymmetric extension of the sm that includes flavour violation, we work out model - independent constraints on the parameter space of scalar interactions, as well as on the fb asymmetry of the decaying scalar particles. we consider the case of large values of the ratio of the wilson coefficients of the neutral higgs and charged higgs fields, thereby setting new constraints on non - standard higgsino mass parameters. at the same time, we are able to make relatively robust estimates for the lower bounds on the susy particle masses, as put forward by the lhc and the tevatron data group. as a by - product, we find that the decay of the higgs sector is strongly constrained by the bound on the rate of decay of light scalar top quarks, and by the constraints imposed on the decay branching ratio, though the achievable experimental constraints are still not very compelling.

in this paper we study network traffic dynamics for single message and multiple message transport in a communication network of nodes and hubs which incorporates geographic clustering. the gradient mechanism is implemented by assigning from each hub on the network some randomly chosen capacity and connecting hubs with lower capacities to the hubs with maximum capacity. the average travel time of single messages traveling on this lattice, plotted as a function of hub density, shows stretched exponential behavior for the base network in the absence of the gradient, but shows q - exponential behavior at higher hub densities if the hubs are connected by the gradient mechanisms. a similar behaviour with a power - law tail is observed if the networks are connected only by random assortative connections. the traffic behaviour is substantially less prone to congestion when the gradient is applied to a few hubs of high co - efficiency of betweenness centrality. we also observe that transport traps can set a limit to the extent to which congestion is cleared at low hub density. [ pacs : 89.20.hc, 89.65.jh, 92.40.cq. ] the functioning of biological, technological and social networks can be studied by the study of their structure and dynamics. examples of such networks are the internet, the world wide web, and cellular networks. these networks generally differ in the way they are organized, their transport patterns, the sizes, and the types of connections between each other. different methods of communication have led to a variety of useful insights into these very different systems. in particular, networks with geometrical or topological features, such as caves, are excellent model systems for message propagation. in these networks a message is routed according to a gradient mechanism which ensures that each hub can process at most one message at most if the hub is connected to several hubs with capacities in the range @xmath0. in addition to the set - up of these networks through the baseline mechanism, various mechanisms have been proposed to reduce congestion in networks@xcite. these mechanisms can be categorized into one - way and two - way mechanisms. the first mechanism is based on the concept of gradient flow which allows the allocation of message capacities to different hubs, giving rise to networks which, in the case of the baseline model, are stochastic in the sense that hubs get connected more rapidly to other hubs as the gradient network grows. in the second mechanism the message capacities are distributed according to the density, hence the network decays faster. these two mechanisms can face each other for transport on a gradient network. in fact,
carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are semiconductors with a range of band gaps which are ideally constructed by rolling up graphitic silicon carbide ( sic ) sheets. in this work, we perform _ ab initio _ density - functional calculations of the sic - nts to study their band structure, optical properties, and strain energies. we find that the static dielectric constants @xmath0 are roughly constant for all the types, except for the zigzag sic which exhibits a pronounced anisotropy. the electrical field parallel to the tube axis is strongly screened in all the cases that we have studied. we also find that for the armchair type cnt(sic)-nts there is a small but discernible chirality dependent oscillation centered at the average value of @xfig0 for both electric field polarizations. furthermore, we show that the zagged sic has a stronger pronounced plasmonic peak than the other two sic types. + * keywords * : graphiticubes, huawei - hubbard system for quantum information processing + * pacs numbers : * 12.38.mh, 24.85.+p, 41.75.-w, 85.35.nq, 42.40.cp optical properties and band structure of a carbon nanotube ( a nic ) have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. there are a number of differences between a single sic sheet and the two wraps around it, especially in the case of a narrow band gap. there is also a difference in the curvature energy of the nic between the sheet and its wraps. the total energy ( as quantified by the strain energy ) is essentially the same for both the wurtzite ( 2h ) and zincblende ( 3c ) sic in the high energy region whilst in the low energy region it is, roughly, made up of a broad hump starting from 6.0 ev. the length of the hump is about half of the magnitude of the localized optical peak in the tube mid - plane. as a result, optical transitions of especially small diameters are possible, and this is especially important for the large diameters. moreover, the obtained results may help to understand the difference between a cnt and a bn - ntic which is currently one of the most active areas of research. * msc ( 2000 ) : calculations and conclusions
the cena group is one of the closest galaxy groups to the local group and contains the richest population of different morphological galaxy types. it has also been the subject of recent deep optical surveys. the present survey is the first large - area 21-cm survey performed in the southern hemisphere. we map the complete sky in the velocity range @xmath0@xmath1. for the purpose of testing the performance of the present limited survey we compare our results with those from three other hi surveys done in the nearby universe, namely the m 81 group, van driel et al. ( 1997 ) and a part of the sculptor group. we found 28 new hi members in our survey area, six of which are newly identified. optical follow - up of the discovered galaxies and a determination of the hi mass function are presented in machine - readable form. our survey is sensitive enough to detect marginal detections and hence is a good tool for studying the faint end of the galactic hi distribution. we find one galaxy with a hi mass of more than 10 m@xday5 - eso174-g?001. this galaxy is the closest to the galactic plane and turns out to have 1000 square degrees of blue extinction, down to 22.8 magnitudes of foreground extinction. when compared with other hi - rich groups of galaxies, the number of low surface brightness galaxies rises dramatically, from a few times 10 in m 81 to 20 in ngc 5253. this suggests that the hi in these galaxies is well mixed. we derive the galaxy faint - end slope and find it can not be significantly steeper than 1.7 at the 95 % level. we discuss possible future developments of the survey.
we deal with the analysis of modern digitized ccd data for extragalactic sources, in particular galaxies, in the context of tests for the cosmological parameters and the evolution of galaxies. we show that the classical tests for isophotal quantities such as the angular diameter - redshift - magnitude relation or the source counts account for all the observational selection effects as well as the effects of the surface brightness profile, and treat the data in terms of the multivariate distribution of apparent surface brightness instead of the commonly used luminosity function. we propose a new method for the calculation of the moments of the observed distributions, which is to be used as a prior for tests based on the observed correlations between relative magnitudes or fluxes of sources, with redshift and angular diameter as the main parameters. the advantage of this new method is that it avoids the complexities associated with the various source counts and with the use of multiple comparisons of the data at different resolutions. the main difficulty in dealing with large samples of sources lies in the fact that the modern data are limited by not merely the fluxes ( or magnitudes ), but also the sizes ( or luminosities ) of the sources. therefore, in this way one can select a subset of data which is less affected by the above selection biases and can yield a more straight forward comparison with models. for example, if we select the more limited sample of large and well resolved sources, we can use fluxes and sizes related to a metric defined to be perpendicular to the observed ` ` proper '' radius, such as that of a put forward by sandage ( 1972 ), or to the @xmath0-log@xmath1 test ( piquero et al. 1974 ). the new method presented in this paper combines the classical approach with the assumption that the observed data are representative of the best available data, and is thus capable of overcoming some of the selection biases which occur in the usual approaches. * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * desy 12 - 159 september 2012 @=12 * * the geometrical / cosmology and particle physics group, universiteit degli mazzitei, morgantown, sloan digital sky survey, + california institute of technology, pasadena, ca 91125, usa. * to be published in the proceedings. *
using the numerical simulation flash, we investigate the mixing of a ( @xmath0 m ) layer of material that has recently accreted from a main sequence companion onto the surface of a white dwarf. we demonstrate that the breaking of non - linear gravity waves on the c / o surface of the white dwarf can lead to the formation of a layer of well - mixed material. this layer and the accompanying vorticity can be transported throughout the envelope by convection, thereby enriching the envelope. this study is part of an ongoing effort to determine the strength and effects of mixing on the evolution of nova ejecta. the simulation presented in this manuscript will provide quantitative information about the mixing rate that will allow for the development of subgrid models for the compressive, reactive flows found in many astrophysical environments. address = department of physics, university of chicago, aw, located at u.s. department of energy, greenbelt, md 20771, usa address = max - planck - institut fr gravitationsphysik, knigsstuhl 17, 69117 heidelberg, germany address = swinburne university of technology, centre for astrophysics and supercomputing, mail h39, po box 218, 21801 north charles street, leicester, cb3 0he, uk address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via e. bianchi 46, i-23807 merate ( lc ), italy address = laboratoire dastrophysique de marseille, universit de provence, cnrs, 38 rue frdric - joliot - curie, f-14388, france address = departamento de fsica aplicada, universidade federal do rio grande do norte, s / n - lagoa nova, 59072 - 970, natal, rn, brazil address = code : flash, a parallel, adaptive mesh simulation code for the hydrodynamical, convection and thermal simulations of novae, presented at the conference on novae and active galactic nuclei, bicontinuous physics, presented in sariyer, may 1995, pp. 140
a @xmath0 deviation from the standard model is reported at lep. we argue that it is unjustified by the evidence itself, and that it can be explained in susy. we give the necessary requirements for the susy explanation to be correct : ( 1 ) stop and chargino masses must be light enough to be detected when the energy of lep is increased to over 140 gev, ( 2 ) the lightest higgsino component must be large, ( 3 ) the stop must be mostly the superpartner of the right - handed top, and ( 4 ) the upper limit on the stop mass must be a large top yukawa coupling. # 1 # 2 # 3 mod. phys. lett. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 4 = cmssbx10 scaled 1 to 0pt#1@xmath1 # 1 hep - th/9510250 + ifum-95/14 + uwthph/9513 + zu - th 20/96 + hep ph/9613384 * ifum * pacs numbers : * 11.10.hi, 12.38.bx, 13.40.gp, 14.60.hq * keywords : * susy, high scale theory, chargino / neutralino, stop / chargino, quark - quark interaction the experimental evidence for recent experimental detections of charginos and neutralinos at high energy has been reviewed in @xcite. these detections have been interpreted as due to a new mechanism, centered around a stop - chargino loop, although the precise form of the loop is not known. in this paper we put forward an alternative interpretation, based on a standard model perspective on the decays of scalar and quark quarks. this model predicts that if the charm quark width is fixed at its standard model value, then a loop effect will be introduced in the spectra of the stopped quarks / higgs particles. we show that this can be realized if the branching ratio for the stop + chargino decays is large, about 0.4. when this occurs the allowed region of parameter space is bordered, leading to the expected decay to a lighter stop ( and, possibly, to a heavier chargino ). indeed, the entire region of the phase diagram for both the light chargino and the light stop occurs this way. to put it mildly, it follows that there is no need to introduce any new mechanism to explain these decays
we show that the k - band luminosities of faint galaxies can be well fit by either the traditional models or the hierarchical models of galaxy formation. we compute the redshift distribution of galaxies with @xmath0 and compare it to the data for the hawaii deep field redshift surveys of songaila et al ( 1994 ) and cowie et al. ( 1996 ). both these samples yield redshifts of at least 1. we then compute the luminosity function as a function of k - magnitude for a set of three different star formation models, namely a pure burst model, a constant star formation model with exponentially declining star formation rates over a hubble time, and a model where the peak star formation happens at very early times rather than at late times. for the three models, we show that a factor of two too high is the number of galaxies predicted to be at high redshift in our models. when applied to the songaila data, however, this number is only ten per cent the values derived for the cowie data. the traditional and hierarchical models differ greatly at the bright end, with the traditional model predicting fifty times more galaxies with@xmath1 and the hierarchical model predicting only 20. the number density of bright galaxies, predicted for the upcoming cowie redshift survey, is expected to be very similar to that in the two surveys. it is also likely that the upcoming survey will detect many fainter galaxies than expected, because of the rapidly decreasing mean luminosity of massive galaxies and the shorter star formation histories of these galaxies. finally, we note that a large fraction of the galaxies in songaila s sample appear to be undergoing a burst while the entire sample is predicted to contain only a few bright galaxies. # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 1 to size # 1 = to size = cmr10 scaled 2 to * please send editorial correspondence to : * + m. a. bransford + _ the astrophysical research foundation _ + _ queen s university, belfast, n.ireland _ + phone : + 61 - 55 - 981 - 2411 + e - mail : mabransf@theherald.edu
the golod - shafarevich method is a flexible and simple method for constructing infinite dimensional, finitely generated algebras of growth. it was shown recently by ershov and kazhdan that if the appropriate relations are introduced in an associative algebra, then the resulting group has a nilpotent normal subgroup of finite index ; as a consequence, good control is achieved on the subspaces of monomials in degree a power of two, which represent ( in a strong sense ) linearly independent elements in the algebra we are about to construct. we exhibit a simple construction to obtain gelfand - kirillov dimension under an appropriate set of conditions on the relations. a closely related construction is the construction of an algebraic closed field via a similar set of relations for the set of free generators of a finite dimensional, noncommutative algebra. we observe that the corresponding group has exponential growth, and its corresponding algebra has growth of at most quadratic order, under the assumption that the relations are spherically symmetric. one of the most tantalizing open problems in algebraic geometry is the existence of groups of growth between polynomial and exponential times. recently, it has been shown by alexander young @xcite and others that there exist groups with medium growth rates that have intermediate growth. the general problem raised by these groups is the following : is there an algebra of finite dimensional homomorphic images with exponential growth? it was pointed out by gromov earlier that, in general, there exists a tendency for groups with intermediate growth rates. indeed, it is natural to expect that the ` optimal'growth rate should be the superpolynomial growth rate, i.e., the superexponential growth rate of a group of maximalimal order. we will address this question in more detail in a forthcoming paper. much later, zhdan will give an affirmative answer to the ` affirmative'question ` why is the answer?'he even goes as far as to state that the answer is ` ` there is no ` ` good control'over the _ growth _ of the group, in spite of the fact that we give a ` ` strong control over the growth rate ''.
simple models of synchronization dynamics exhibit an unexpectedly rich phenomenology when operating on top of empirical human brain networks, hinting at the presence of a hidden structure which hinders collective coherence. what is more striking is that such a complex behavior would be impossible to obtain in networks with much stronger connectivity patterns, such as scale free - networks or high - degree random graphs, which already shows strong signals of the ideal hierarchical structure reflected in the human connectome. here we study a family of hierarchical modular networks describing the evolution of the attractor dynamics in the hubble network ( hc ), revealing the existence of an intermediate regime between the coherent and incoherent stretched - exponential asymptotic behavior. this is characterized by broad quasi - periodic temporal oscillations of @xmath0, whose onsets are located within well - separated levels ( which we call transition points ), that as a matter of fact can be identified by using standard community detection algorithms. two distinct transitions are found in the level of internal coherence : at low levels, local order emerges out of a bottom - up ordering process in which progressively larger communities with inherently different timescales are coherent. at higher levels, i.e. at the collective level, local coherences prevail over a broad range of inter - moduli bandwidths allowing the system to escape from metastable and chimera - like states with traits of local coherence at different hierarchical levels. a prominent feature of the hc hierarchical modular structure is the strong separation between two different levels of coherence a regime characterized by metastable coherence and an oscillatory pattern in which the system remains trapped between two levels due to the absence of a phase lag. this, together with the heterogeneous frequencies at the contact nodes ( interfaces ), suggests that the system is on the verge of achieving regime of complete global synchronization. the result is a complex synchronization landscape, which is especially rich and diverse in the intermediate regime put forward here. likely additional realistic ingredients such as explicit phase frustration and time delays to our simplistic approach should add complexity to the structural frustration effect reported here. it is also expected that more refined models including neuro - realistic ingredients including time delays would generate similar results.
we present new high - resolution maps of the optical spiral arms in the giant elliptical galaxy m51, in total and in linear polarization at @xmath0. the maps are of comparable angular resolution to previous ones, and enable us for the first time to study in detail the interaction between the magnetic field and the spiral arms. we analyze the regular magnetic field as a function of azimuth angle and find that it is well aligned with the arms and is compressed by the bar s shock. we consider the possibility of decompression of the regular and random magnetic fields and conclude that this may be the dominant cause of the arm - interarm contrast in radio emission. however, the additional compression of the random magnetic field may suppress the average polarized emission by compression and/or shear. thus, we need an additional source of polarized emission, likely of anisotropic nature. we identify the source of the polarized emission in the arms : a ) there is a large - scale field parallel to the lines of constant density, at a distance of about 7 kpc from the centre of m51 ; b ) around 5 kpc in radius the field is axisymmetric ( positive ) with respect to the ( negative ) magnetic field. = -0.5 in # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 1#2 # 1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3. # 1icyclotron, # 1 ( # 2 ) # 1 circumnuclear region galaxies : spiral galaxies : individual : m51 polarimetry, polarization methods : data analysis
we present a near - infrared, high angular resolution ( @xmath0 ) survey of the young, dense, solar neighbourhood cluster ic348. the cluster is located in the perseus molecular cloud, at a distance of about 320 pc. the purpose of this survey is to study the relation between the cluster structure and the binary fraction of young stars. about 100 stars are found to be members, and about 70 of them have independently been confirmed as members on the basis of colour - magnitude diagrams. the total number of binaries is about 70. we find that the binary frequency in ic348 is similar to that of the old pleiades cluster, and that it has been established at the very beginning of the cluster evolution. this binary fraction is much higher, by about a factor of two, than in all other young clusters we have studied ( taurus, ophiuchus, chamleon ). on the other hand, no correlation is found between the binary number and the cluster density ( in contrast to the trapezium cluster ). we interpret this as an intrinsic output of the fragmentation process during the formation of the cloud, and argue that it is too early to draw conclusions from the existence of binary systems with this level of initial multiplicity. still, the correlation between binary frequency and cluster density can not be excluded in the framework of current models of fragmentation and disk instability. it is possible that environmental conditions in the cloud at the time of star formation play a role in determining the final binary fraction, but the detailed analysis of x - ray and uv data is still lacking. if this is the case, the cloud environment had to be favourable, because of the relatively low star formation rate ( sfr ) in the parent cloud, compared to other clusters ( e.g., the taurus ), would lead to a higher binary fraction if the initial cloud temperature was lower than the current estimated value.

we present the results of our radial velocity survey of hd 119445, a giant star associated with the korean - japan ( japan ) planet search network ( eaps ), using a precise doppler technique carried out with the 1.8-m telescope at the boao and 1.88-m telescopes at oao, respectively. we discovered about 190 stars from the @xmath0 catalog targeted at boao, including many with large radial velocity variations that were not detected by previous radial velocity surveys. each star is observed independently at the assigned observatory, although a systematic modulation in the radial velocity amplitude is observed at both observatories. high - resolution spectra are obtained using the high - dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ) attached to the coud focus of the telescope and are used to derive radial velocity profiles and constrain planet - formation models using the spectral modeling techniques detailed in @xcite. the derived structures are not dissimilar to those found for other stars of intermediate mass, and some of them are even closer to solar - mass stars. some of the inferred properties of planets orbiting intermediate - mass giant stars are not well understood yet. the number of substellar companions found around more massive stars seems to be correlated with their host star mass : the range for planets around solar - type stars is large than 0.02 au, and the planetary companion detected orbiting the giant star is the lowest - mass companion among those found around massive mid - massive stars. the total mass of the companions detected has been estimated with a combination of fitting star light curves, interferometry with radial velocity data, and fitting of keplerian orbits. these results are in good agreement with the expectations from a mass - dependent dynamical instability. a unified understanding of planetary systems over a wide range of host star masses will provide insights into substellar systems on the central stars and into general planet formation mechanisms.
we propose a technique to gain information about the relative phases between the scattering processes of a class of particles using correlated photons emitted by two separated and unpolarized detectors. it is based on an effect called linked polarization that has been studied previously by hanbury brown and twiss. we show that, by projectifying the states of the two emitters, and thereby obtaining information about their correlated emission, we can enhance our understanding of their relative phases. for a star, the method could be used to measure the radius of sirius, and to probe exotic states of matter that might be subject to long - range entanglement. @xmath0 address=(1 ) department of physics, university of virginia, charlottesville, va 22904 - 4714, usa ) @xcite address=(2 ) mullard space science laboratory, university college london, holmbury st. mary, dorking, surrey, rh5 6nt, uk@xmath1 address=(3 ) nasa goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 20742 usa _ emphasis : _ quantum interference in stellar and particle physics _ + e.g. _ the mach - zehnder interferometer has made tremendous progress in allowing measurements of non - identical, soft x - ray emission from very nearby sources. it has also made possible to measure, in a simple experiment, the non - uniform, absolute squares of the probability amplitudes of transitions between different decay modes of particles in a known ensemble of particles. a, bose - einstein condensates ( becky ) and superfluid have been measured at very high energies in both linear and mixtures of different energies, demonstrating the possible existence of quantum interference between bosons and fermions. however, such measurements have generally not been carried out due to the explicit violation of local locality in the sources. here we propose a different way to access information about source states that is _ correlated _, i.e., where two distinct processes contribute to correlated firing of detectors. " we will be interested in sources that emit in orthogonal polarizations, for example. this naturally leads to the question : if the sources have non - trivial polarization properties ( for example, linked polarization ), how can we access them? our approach can also be applied to the interference of photons of different wavelengths. say we have two high - energy photon emitters with a common initial state, and two low - energy photons of a different wavelength. we assume
we present a new run - time security monitor for real - time monitoring of network traffic that is sound and complete. our security monitor is based on a high - level specification language which is the framework for the denotational semantics of the application specification. the specification language allows not only to specify dependencies, system level behavior and security properties ( in case of partial design details ), but also to specify internal system behavior and complex security properties of ` ` legacy '' systems as well. we instrument the systems by probing and passing data to another component that forms a basis of the system s model and the latter is used to monitor the implementation of the program. the security monitor can be viewed as a program that runs in the virtual machine ( ics ) environment. it consists of a water tank, a level sensor and a pump that is capable of either filling or draining the tank. the tank has a natural leakage rate that is proportional to the height of the water column in the monitored system. the program s behavior is defined as a predicate over sets of input and output values, set of allowable values, a pre - state and a post - state of the behavior. the intent of the paper is to show the absence of false alarms and to verify the correctness of the monitoring. our formalism is similar to crash hoare - logic used to capture the faulty behavior of a file system. we use a method analogous to classical set builder to build a profile of bad behavior of the systems and more specifically, build statistical profiles of attacks. the analysis of such profiles provides information on the characteristics of the attack plan and it allows us to efficiently characterize the way in which a component may have misbehaved. finally, diagnosis is a selection of behaviors among the different attack modes. it allows the user to specify how each attack mode ( normal / compromised ) behaves and a set of rules expressing the conditional probabilities between attack modes and different behaviors of the components. = 1
we carried out three dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of magnetic reconnection in a relativistic pair plasma with varying guide field strength. the simulations include the usual harris sheet configuration, but are now able to evolve through the nonlinear development of a fully three dimensional flux rope network. with the aid of fourier decomposition, we ascertained that the linear tearing mode is responsible for the early evolution of the current sheet. in most of the simulations, the tearing mode produces chains of magnetic flux ropes separated by primary x - lines. the flux ropes merge in hierarchical fashion whereby the merging time scale is proportional to the flux rope separation. during this phase, we find that the dimensionless reconnection rates in the simulations are similar to those detected in other three dimensional simulations. we also find that spatial variation of an off - diagonal component of the pressure tensor is responsiblefor the breaking of flux freezing at the x - points in the reconnection layer. while the hierarchical flux rope merging process initially appears similar to that found in the two dimensional simulations, in fact it is three - dimensional from the outset. we find an evolution of magnetic field geometry that constrains the viability of models for high - lundquist - number reconnection layers in which the diffusion region contains a hierarchy of interacting plasmoids. we furthermore investigate the overall rate of magnetic - to - thermal energy conversion as well as the efficiencies, mechanisms, and properties of particle energization in the series of simulations. energy conversion is described as a function of the guide - field strength and we observe that it is nonthermal in nature. the amount of energy dissipated in the plasma is ultimately determined by the plasma ` ` skin depth '' which is the fraction of the plasma that is in the form of flux ropes. the resulting network of interconnected flux ropes forms a topologically interconnected, dynamically evolving network. it is consistent with previously suggested quasi - two - dimensional plasmoid hierarchies.
the evolution of the universe is driven by the complex interplay of a large number of processes that involve the exchange of mass and energy. cooling of diffuse gas is thought to be an important part of this global energy interchange. in this paper, we investigate the radiative cooling of gas within galaxies and their haloes in the context of the intergalactic medium and attempt to provide a global view of how cooling occurs in diffuse gas. to this end, we use a subset of runs from the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls ) project to investigate a number of questions concerning the emission and cooling processes of diffuse gaseous gas, including : i ) which transitions, ions, and gas phases are responsible for most of the cooling radiation and therefore should be the focus of theoretical modelling efforts? ii ) which wavebands and emission lines carry most ( if any ) of the energy emitted by diffuse gas through cooling and fluorescence radiation and should thus be primary targets for observational studies? iii ) what is the relative importance of continuum emission and line emission, and how does it change with time? how much energy is stored in the igm? iv ) what are the characteristic cooling times in galaxies? since our focus is on diffuse gas, we will ignore emission by dust and by gas with densities higher than @xmath0-@xmath1. the paper presents the first results of the investigation. we aim to identify the cooling channels that dominate the energy budget of the diffuse gas that traces the large - scale structure of the physical universe and that feeds galaxies and fuels star formation through accretion processes. we use owls simulations to perform a preliminary analysis of the average energy densities of individual ions, emission lines and continuum emission in the simulation. we find that individual emission lines contribute about one third of the total emitted energy in the temperature - dependent ` ` temperature bin '' defined by ionic lines and wavebands, and half of that in the ` ` continuum bin ''. only lines contribute contribute at least 1 per cent to the total energy in at least one temperature bin.
we develop a formalism for finding the tail decay rates of a nonnegative matrix with quenched block structure. we do this by taking a discrete - time two dimensional reflecting random walk on a quarter plane of lattice. the state space of such a process is composed of the first row and the first column blocks, as well as the two half coordinate axes. when one of the blocks is nonnegative, its state space is homogeneous, that is, different regions may have different state - transitions. in the stochastic case when the matrix is substochastic and does not have the boundary blocks, the tail asymptotics of the stationary distribution are known. for this, we develop a canonical form for the markov modulated two dimensional random walk. this is shown to be tractable, and in fact, has a right subinvariant vector, which is crucial in applications of the generalized jackson network. we obtain the right invariant vectors by numerically solving certain parametrized equations over a certain set of parameters. this enables us to use probabilistic arguments for manipulating @xmath0 in computations. we attack the problem of tail modulation, and find a solution which is tractable. we are also interested in the application of these methods to two node queueing networks, so we study those problems in these direction. the tail modulation problem has been extensively studied in network applications ( see, e.g., @xcite ). consider an infinite dimensional square matrix which is said to have qbd block structure if it is partitioned into blocks in such a way that each block is a square matrix of the same size unless the whole matrix is block tridiagonal and each row of blocks is repeated and shifted except for the first two rows. then, we define a curve which outputs the tail probability. in most of the applications, the probability has at least two values, and these curves are known, as we will show in the next section.
the transition - metal deficiency in ceagbi@xmath0 is the subject of intense experimental and theoretical debate. although it has been suggested that this deficiency is due to competing spin exchanges and single - ion anisotropy combined with anisotropic exchange parameters ( with opposite signs in reciprocal space ), the bulk energetics of the material is rather well - established experimentally. it has recently been shown, however, that the field - induced magnetic order and temperature dependence of this order is rather complex, displaying a plethora of exotic phases separated by a complex interlayer coupling. to elucidate the nature of the magnetic order, here we use angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements on closely - related compounds, and single crystals of ce, to probe the low - temperature magnetic response as a function of an applied parallel and perpendicular magnetic field. for the best samples to date, the response of the ce local magnetic moments has been found to be entirely dominated by dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions, despite the fact that ferromagnetic correlations exist in ce. competing interactions can lead to a multitude of metamagnetic transitions, the most prominent among which are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering and a metal - insulator transition ( mit ). we here discuss the question of what origin for the unusual magnetic behavior of cebased on the data. we resort to a mean - field approach, using the latest experimental data on the magnetization and the magnetoresistance ( mr ) as input parameters, and combine them with a dynamical spin model for the local moments and the full three - dimensional magnetic order. we find that the magnetic response of ce is largely controlled by the @xmath1-dimensional mr phase diagram, in agreement with the experimental data. the fully - polarized local moments form a ` magnetically ordered'state that is separated from the itinerant charge carriers by 19 k and 60 k, suggesting that the first excited cef state is already partially occupied at this temperature. the magnetic entropy of this ordered state decreases as the field is increased, giving rise to an entropy reduction of up to 20 % reduction in the peak specific heat. this effect can be fully accounted for by classical magnetic fluctuations, even if we restrict ourselves to working within a classical spin approximation. submitted to the physical review
in order to understand the differences in the performance of direct and module - based methods in inferring regulatory interactions from gene expression data, we perform a detailed comparison using public data from two well characterized gene networks : _ escherichia coli _ and _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _. we first use recall versus precision curves to give a comparison of the global performance of both methods. we show that because of the different structure of the regulatory networks inferred, they infer topologically distinct networks with limited overlap, even at equal performance thresholds. we then look at a closer look at the chemotaxis and flagellar system in _ e. coli _, studying recall and precision with respect to the given reference networks. in order to compare the lemone and clr networks, we compare their recall regions with the yeastract database. the precision curves show that if an edge is predicted between two genes present but unconnected in the reference network it is counted as a false positive. lemone on the other hand is superior at inferring interactions for regulators that are known to regulate larger regulons, such as fis, lexa, purr, and rpos, for which the level of coexpression is not as high as the one observed within a single operon. the regulatory network inferred by clr has the advantage of containing many targets of known regulatory activity. however, it is not possible to distinguish between targets of flhdc and flia due to the large overlap in predicted targets. we also show that regulatory module assignments based on a pairwise correlation measure between the expression profiles of a transcription factor and its putative targets are misleading. in several cases the predicted regulator is the one which has the best target enrichment @xmath0-value. nearly half of the regulators are putative regulators without any currently known targets, and these assignments can not be validated. interestingly however, many of the correctly predicted regulators involve neighbor regulators. the clr ( context likelihood of relatedness ) algorithm considers all possible pairwise regulator - target interactions and scores these interactions based on the mutual information of their expression profiles as compared to an interaction specific background distribution. it has been shown to outperform the original module network algorithm.
we report a new method for the analysis of optical spectra of semi - transparent samples, where the main feature is fabry - prot interference. when a double side polished si wafer of uniform thickness is imaged with a broad field - effect transistor, the high finesse and low loss characteristics of the silicon film are retained, along with a significant degree of finesse in the optical transmission spectrum. this approach, which we describe in detail, provides a major advantage in the case of crystalline wafers, in particular for samples with very small thickness inhomogeneity, where optical modelling of such spectra is extremely challenging. moreover, we show that this approach resolves the well - known problem of undulations between different sample regions, so that all intrinsic optical features are preserved. we demonstrate this with a comparison of reflectance and transmittance spectra for the epitaxial compounds bisbse@xmath0te, grown by monochromatic illumination of a slabs of bromide on a substrate of hispanic composition. our analysis reveals the presence of ( partially ) detached flakes on the back surface of the sample, to which optical transmission measurements are sensitive. such interference is caused by the interplay between ferromagnetic and electronic absorption, and is thus difficult to identify. in most cases it is so deeply embedded in the crystal that it is impossible to remove, even with a very high precision. in some cases, however, a solution may be found. that is, the wavelength dependence of the optical response to a waveguide can provide information on the local structure of the crystal, while the waveguide itself is not known. in the limit of extremely small sample sizes ( @xmath1 m ), the information provided by such a fourier transform may be sufficient to completely remove the interference, without requiring the knowledge of the refractive index. in this case the only remaining effect is anundulation, which is a manifestation of the electron - phonon asymmetry @xcite and therefore can also be used to distinguish electronic from electronic absorption. in another context, the measurement of electrical properties, such as resistance and ohmic conductivity, is also of importance. for example, the frequency of switching from a paramagnetic to a magnetically ordered state can strongly affect the electrical performance of a burner@xcite. from a photonic point of view, an additional source of disorder is scattering of the signal due to disorder in the free - air condition. this leads to a major reduction in the switching cost of optically driven
we have carried out a one - year long photometric monitoring campaign for transiting small - size planets around 23 nearby ( @xmath0 pc ) m dwarfs in the autonomous region of the aosta valley ( oavda ), using small ( 25 - 80 cm class telescope systems ) dwarf stars. the early - m dwarf gj 581 was targeted in this survey, and the later two stars, lhs 3445 and gj 1167a, were targeted as possible members of a system of four low - mass ( neptunes and super - earths ) planets already known to reside in the backyard of our solar system. the primary goal of this study was to demonstrate _ sizescopic _ robustness in the detection / characterization of small - radius planets with periods of a few days around our program stars, through a two - fold approach that combines a characterization of the statistical noise properties of our photometry with the determination of transit detection probabilities via simulations, and _ where possible, _ we seek to improve our knowledge of some astrophysical properties ( e.g., activity, rotation, age ) of our targets through a combination of spectroscopic and astrometric information and our differential photometric measurements. we achieved short - term and medium - term photometric sensitivity for the main stars of our sample, achieving a typical nightly photometric precision of ( 0.51.5)@xmath1 mmag with an average rms photometric error of 0.01 mmag in the 0.10.4 bands, and an average correlated ( redshift 1.12.3 ) error of 1.02 mmag on a time - scale of 2 months. we investigated the impact of different detrending algorithms utilized to perform differential photometry on the targets, and found that in general our data are only mildly affected by the use of correlated ( 1.1 - 2.0 ) systematics. taking advantage of the clear evidence of sinusoidal photometric patterns ascribed to rotating spots on the stellar photosphere, we found two flares, occurring on timescales of approximately 3.5 and 4.5 min, respectively, correlated with an almost constant level of photometric variability. these flares were identified as a likely site - induced jitter, and we set upper limits on the planet fraction as a function of radius and orbital separation.
we determine the global value of the hubble constant @xmath0 by investigating a hubble flow of a sample of 1524 galaxies distributed in a volume larger than the scale of inhomogeneous galaxy distribution in the universe. the large size of the pisces - perseus region enabled us to examine an effect of biases in the tf analysis. photographic observations of seventy galaxies in the region are used to calibrate the photographic data. the flux calibration is carried out using the arecibo data of longo and de vaucouleurs ( 1983 ). a maximum likelihood analysis is applied to the data for each galaxy to obtain an unbiased estimate of the tully - fisher relation ( tf ). the result of the analysis is consistent with previous studies based on different methods. for the purpose of this study we have also corrected for the malmquist bias assuming a uniform galaxy distribution. this method has the following advantages. first, it provides unbiased measurements of the motion of galaxies for a large number of different inclinations. second, the data are spread over a large volume which can not be summarized in a global velocity space. third, the sample is large in terms of the number of galaxies so that the tf data are independent of the spatial scale of the flow. our result is also consistent with a recent study by giovanelli et al. ( 1997a ) based on cepheids observations, the sne ia and ii data, and the pnlf distances. however, our survey is limited to five clusters, compared to such studies which extend to much further distances. using cepheid observations we find a negative coherent flow for about 20 % of the sample. if the same physics applies to the galaxies in each cluster, this flow would have to be negative to be consistent with the results of other studies. + * keywords * : galaxies : distances ; galaxies : clusters : general ; large - scale structure of the universe
we provide a detailed characterization of the stars with corot type i and ii light curves in ngc 2264, based on simultaneous or contemporaneous observations of the entire star - forming region using the vlt / flames and spitzer space telescope. by selection, their optical light curves appear symmetric about their median level, with no preference for discrete downward flux dips ( variable extinction ) nor upward flux bursts ( short - duration flux bursts ). the lack of flux dips due to extinction excludes stars where the inclination of our line of sight to the circumstellar disk is large, implying @xmath0 60@xmath1. the near - ir light curves of the stochastic stars are only slightly different, on average, from those of the variable extinction stars. as traced by their uv excesses and associated veiling of optical absorption lines, the stars in our light curve class have low to moderate accretion rates, similar to, but somewhat larger than, the accretion burst stars. their mean black - body temperature is about 1.5 times cooler than that of the disk stars in the same cluster ; their photospheric veiling is consistent with one of the largest irac fluxes ; and their multi - epoch photometric variability is generally consistent with the fluctuations in the short - wavelength irac light curve derived from photometry. in addition to the diversity of properties discussed in this paper, we provide a table of seventeen ctts for which we have synoptic vlt spectroscopy. the list appears as follows : 0.01truein1 stars ; 1.25truein2 stars ; 2.35truein3 stars ; 3.07truein4 stars ; 4.38truein5 stars ; 5.05truein6 stars _ with unknown intrinsic color, veiling, rotation velocity, and type ii classification _ : + 17a1, 17b, 17c2, 17d, 17e, 17f, 16g2, 16e6, 16c4
the observation of downward air - showers, made by ultra - relativistic hadronic or electro - magnetic cosmic rays ( uhecr ), will open a new window for understanding non - perturbative physics and open new physics pathways to quark and lepton showers. we give a new general expression for the probability of observing a nearly vertical, nearly tangential, uhe @xmath0 air - shower, uptaus. it is analogous to the analogous hortaus in atomic and molecular physics, but at lower altitude and for a higher ( eev ) energy band. the ratio of probability to observe an uptaus to that to a hortau is proportional to the uhe neutrino energy. in view of this new outlook on air showers it is possible to discriminate three main types of uptaus likely to be detectable on auger, e.g. glast, utaus and hias. ( 1 ) low altitude, nearly vertical ( few km ) _ air shower _ from a satellite or balloon, hitting the observer at the horizons edge ; the highest up - ward and lowest down - ward signature may be seen by a wide spaced array in space. ( 2 ) a nearly horizontal, but thin fan - shaped beam of upward charged particles hitting the earth from the far away horizons and returning to the galactic center ; its vertical motion may be observed by a very wide twin beam in a fan shape. ( 3 ) a high altitude air shower at the eastern, or middle horizons, originated by horizontal, almost tangential ( in a thin layer of air above, but only a few meters in height ), emanating from a thin mountain chain, which is ignored in previous works. its vertical trajectory is bounded by a thin terrestrial layer and its direction of propagation is deflected horizontally by the terrestrial magnetic field. its horizontal propagation is forbidden by the severe opacity of the earth below as well as by the hadronic and/or electric interaction with matter above. ( 4 ) upward air showers, produced by nearly linear tracers of uhe cr ( showers ) on the mountain chains, may be detected on balloons or satellites but their expected rate is small due to the short life - time. their signals may be be observed on balloons and satellites as well.
we present new spectroscopic observations of the metal - rich wolf - rayet galaxy ( wr ) mkn 309. the new data are combined with previously published optical and uv data and are used to constrain the basic properties of the massive star populations ( imf slope, m_up @xmath3 ) and the star formation history ( age, burst duration ) of these objects by detailed quantitative comparisons with evolutionary synthesis models. the observed morphologies are consistent with continuous star formation extending over a duration of about 715 myr or a superposition of several bursts with similar age differences ( 410 myr burst ). such extended burst durations, compared to other wr galaxies, indicate even shorter star formation timescales. the upper mass cut - off of the imf is found to lie in a narrow range ( 200 - 300 ) for all objects studied. this indicates that the stellar population is well mixed and that there is no significant population of supergiants. the oxygen abundance derived from the [ o ii ] + [ o iii ] line is 9.39.4, concurring with previous estimates for more metal rich wr galaxies. the derived physical conditions ( temperature, metallicity, and h@xmath4 equivalent width ) are all very similar to those derived from studies of metal - poor h ii regions and agree well with recent metal abundance determinations by guseva et al. ( 1999a ). taking into account the distance effect and other sources of incompleteness, a salpeter imf with an extended duration is compatible with all observations. the constraints derived from this model are also confirmed by analysis of the uv and optical light emitted by the wr stars. although not yet well established, the association of wr stars with the h ii region suggests that the most massive stars formed in such environments are of high initial mass and are relatively unimportant in the evolution of galaxies.

we present a macroscopic approach to the low - energy nuclear response based on the statistical description of an excited compound nucleus in terms of quasiparticle - vibration coupling. we show how the shell structure of open - shell nuclei can be described in a fully self - consistent extension of the covariant energy density functional theory ( ci - jj7a ) truncated by the tamm - dancoff proton - neutron phonon coupled to particle - hole core vibrations. the gross and fine features of the gtr obtained within these models are compared, the advantages and drawbacks of the considered models are discussed. based on such comparative studies, future directions are outlined for each of the above mentioned microscopic models. moreover, we expect further advancements in the achievable range of parameters for the obtained models. the predicted many - body coupling schemes and underlying interactions will need to be constrained by data on nuclei away from the valley of stability. such data will be obtained at existing, and vastly enhanced capabilities presented by future rare isotope facilities. * upbend in radiative neutron capture strength of nuclei * +.3 in k. goda@xmath0, m. i. mikhailov @xmath1, v. e. glick @xcite, d. g. govi @xcitrov, a. m. harris @xcited, and m. ivanov, _ advances in nuclear research _ ( crc press, 2008 ), 2nd ed. s. kivshar, r. w. heckenberg, _ encyclopedia of ion and nuclear properties _ ( wiley - interscience, 2000 ). 1.0 cm pacs : 42.50.+g, 05.10.-a, 42.25.+d, 92.60.-k, 85.60.+e.- m.- j. kimball + _ department of physics and astronomy, carnegie mellon university, pittsburgh pa 15213, usa _ +.25 in m. skubic, _ the graduate university for advanced studies in physics ( sokendai ), + tsukuba 305 - 0801, japan _.5 in
we consider the bell experiment, a device - independent cryptographic task against an eavesdropper constrained only by the laws of relativity, in which there are two space - like separated parties. in this paper, we postulate a modification to the usual no - signaling constraints that are imposed by relativistic causality, such that no faster - than - light ( ftl ) transmission of information takes place between a sender and a receiver. we geometrically analyze the exact space - time region in the three - party bell scenario where this modification is possible. we then propose a new class of relativistically causal bilocal models in the general @xmath0-party scenario and examine its violation within quantum theory. in the task of randomness amplification, we detail explicit attacks on provenance sufficient to ensure that no causal loop appears in the experiment. we show that in this regime, the only restriction we consider is that there be no causal loops in spacetime, where a causal loop is a sequence of events in which one event is among the causes of another event, which in turn introduces the first event. causality implies that for two causally related events taking place at two spatially separated points, the cause always occurs before the effect and this sequence can not be changed by any choice of a frame of reference. the freedom - choice constraints imposed by bell on the configuration of the measurement events of the two parties are shown to be consistent with these new constraints whenever the spacetime region of the measured events is allowed to deviate from the chosen fixed point. we further show that the phenomenon of monogamy of correlations violating the chsh inequality no longer holds in certain spacetime configurations, i.e., when no superluminal influence occurs. we therefore argue that any attempt to explain quantum correlations around the world based on any finite - speed explanation of canonical quantum correlations will therefore be discarded. finally, we investigate the phenomenology of multiparty non - locality in light of the new considerations and propose a rigorous definition of the multi - party free - selection constraints.
we consider the physics of a two - dimensional model of undoped copper oxide lattice in which a fixed number of doped holes is added to one and only one row of the lattice. we show that this model has a number of interesting features. for instance, there is a continuous finite temperature transition from a high temperature disordered phase to the low temperature nel phase, including the effect of weak coulomb repulsion between holes on second - neighbor o orbitals. this transition is stabilized by quantum effects from the antiferromagnetic super - exchange interactions, and depends on the ratio of the one - electron to the two - electron energies. moreover, low order corrections to the strong coupling limit resolve the spin - degeneracies we have neglected, so the point group symmetry can be restored, and the resulting phase is a nematic insulator. we compare the energy of this nematic phase with that of an isotropic version. the emery model also has interesting features in the strong - coupling limit, including : ( i ) a 4-spin - ring exchange interaction on a plaquette generated at 8@xmath0 order ; ( ii ) a bent hole - exciton bound - state, with a low energy excitation at the intersection of rows and columns ; ( iii ) a 1d - like excitation resulting from a disturbance in the exciton - hole correlation distribution outside of the row ; and ( iv ) a broken symmetry ground state with energy @xmath1. the model considered has regions of the phase diagram which are confined to a given energy or so and which can be physically described by a schechter function or by a magnetic field. these properties are at least as conventionally understood in terms of quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems, and quite different from those of more traditional 2d systems, in which 2d structural symmetries are broken by interactions ( _ e.g. _ the cu d - orbitals ). it is natural to extend the analysis to include the quantum effects of these quantum effects on the hole dynamics in a 2d system, but we argue that this is already too complicated to consider such a general problem.
we present a novel spectral approach to risk - neutral densities ( rnds ) recovered from quoted option prices. in this framework, nonparametric methods and models of the underlying price process are used to recover a rnd. we first show that it is possible to define _ restricted put and call operators _ the positive valued price of an underlying at a deterministic future date and the payoff of a contingent claim maturing at time @xmath0. we then show that this new framework allows to devise a simple and fast quadratic programming method to recover the smoothest rnd that is consistent with market bid - ask quotes. specifically, assuming that the market is _ complete _ as far as the estimated rnd is concerned, our spectral approach enables us to search for lower frequency information about the rnd in quoted options prices than other methods. it is shown that the obtained results are in excellent agreement with those obtained via the _ smoothed implied volatility smile method _ and the _ martingale measure_. based on this test, we propose a simple algorithm to estimate the gauss - hermite form of a put operator from the data. this algorithm is implemented as a duality check, i.e., it requires no fine tuning. we conclude by presenting a simple command - line program that anyone can use to sample the capability of the proposed methodology. + _ keywords _ : arbitrage pricing theory ; credit creation banking ; credit quality control ; risk neutral density ; valuation volatility ; valuation spread * program summary * _ manuscript title : _ the jordan - smith method + _ authors : _ beat rnd recovery : + aura alexander s. v.bitiou@xmath1 and janusz k.h.- j. zhang + _ programs used : _ _ spie _ + _ nature of problem _ + recovery of rnd from listed options prices + _ solution method : _ + a spectral approach is developed, which not only allows recovery of the true rnd, but also allows to access the full tail of the estimated density, which is crucial for the recovery of quotes, as well as the functional form of the associated rnd estimator. the results are shown to be consistent with the market data and to be useful for derivative securities trading in the financial market.
we develop a spatially discretized fluctuating hydrodynamics ( fhd ) model for reaction - diffusion systems and develop numerical schemes to solve the resulting stochastic ordinary differential equations for the number densities of chemical species in each cell. we obtain the diffusion part of the sodes from an fhd description of a microscopic system consisting of molecules having independent brownian motions, and treat reactions using the second - order tau leaping and ssa methods, respectively. using well - established techniques for numerical solution of pdes and spdes, we demonstrate the scalability of our fhd approach by presenting a three - dimensional numerical simulation of chemical front propagation in a two - species model. as a reference method for comparison, we use an rdme - based method which is constructed via a standard operator splitting technique for multinomial diffusion sampling. we demonstrate that the immidtau ( or immidssa ) scheme scales very well with an increasing number of molecules per cell so that even the deterministic limit of vanishing fluctuations can be explored. in particular, our numerical methods, including the modified arithmetic - mean averaging function discussed in the paper, accurately reproduce the poisson statistics that characterize the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution for the numbers of molecules in a cell, and closely reproduce the coefficient of diffusion in the limit of small fluctuations. in contrast, the @xmath0-dimensional turing - like pattern formation in the three - species baras pearson mansour model is still not accurately described by the fhd equations because the time step size can be significantly larger than the hopping time scale. to demonstrate the validity of our approach, we numerically investigate not only a system at steady state, but also time - dependent systems that exhibit a spatio - temporal pattern formation. using two - stage runge kutta temporal integrators, we investigate the temporal accuracy of the structure factors of the one - dimensional schlgl model at different wavenumbers. compared to our previous work @xcite, where the coupling effects of fluid hydrodynamic and chemical fluctuations have been investigated, we find that our numerical schemes for reaction and diffusion are robust for large fluctuations.
we present new results from our hst and spitzer imaging campaigns and spectroscopic follow - up of a sample of 30 low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) galaxies selected from the union of the galex and sdss lyman break analogs ( lbas ). these local analogs have properties that are similar to those of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ). in particular, the mass - luminosity relation for clumps in the uv is very similar to that for luminous ir galaxies, with mass - to - light ratios and scale - sizes that are a factor of two larger than those found in local galaxies. the morphologies of the lbas are dominated by massive, compact ( radii of a few hundred pc ) star - forming clumps of young stars. we estimate masses of up to several hundred m@xmath1 and stellar masses of tens to a few thousand m(1 ). the star - formation rate in these massive clumps is typically a few per cent of the eddington limit, while their half - light radii are several per cent larger than that of their local counterparts. the massive compact objects ( ` ` dcos '' ) are only marginally resolved in the hst far - uv images, with total masses of only a few tens of per cent and scale sizes of several kpc. the galaxies containing the dcos have systematically higher central concentrations of light than other lbas ( the dco is typically located near the center of a larger disk or envelope ), and the galaxies with dcos tend to have higher gas densities and pressures as traced by the ionized gas emission line ratios. the total light in galaxies containing dcos is dominated by the starburst regions rather than the clumps, although a dco may still be present in some galaxies due to a lack of agn coverage. we also find a correlation between the physical properties of the massive dcos and those of their surrounding ism, in particular a positive correlation between clump mass and gas density, which is indicative of an energetically - obscured agn. this correlation is not observed in the virgo and argo - ybj systems, where the line - of - sight neutral gas density is at least an order of magnitude higher than that in the nearby universe. finally, we discuss some of the peculiarities that are unique among the lba s such as their high optical to mid - ir luminosities, large sizes, high column densities, and high
we report the discovery of two simultaneous khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the z source cygnus x-2 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer. between june 30th and july 3rd 1997 the source was observed in the 25.0 kev and 122 @xmath0s energy bands with similar time resolution in 129 photon energy channels ( effective energy range 260 kev ). we found that the z track in the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) moved from the region of the hb / nb vertex to the left and back to the vertex again, and from there to the right. the track was on the lower part of the nb ( called nb ) and located almost along the z, making it difficult to detect the z for different overall intensity levels. we detected only one khz qpo in the 5.060 kev band. during the two days after the observation the source moved on average by 0.07@xmath014 hz ( 0.2@x math00.1 hz ) from the hbs end to the fb vertex, and by 1 hz, and even by as much as 10 hz. the fwhm and rms amplitude of the higher - frequency qpo were 2.4 % and 4.7 % rms, respectively. when the overall intensity level was changed we detected the hbo for the first time. the qpo was only detected on time scales of weeks to months, and in the corresponding time intervals were 3.4 s, 4.5 s, and 9.8 s. during the whole z track, zonal motion was not detected, and the timing properties, including the khz frequency, were very similar to those found for the 3 z sources ginga x-1 and exosat. for the lower - frequency ( 4.9 s ) qpo the effect on the flux correlation function was a factor of 4.03.03 in the 0.49.7 kev energy band, and an increase in the count rate of the source to a value of 3.56.56 times the eddington value at the end of the observation. upper limits on the amplitudes of the qpos for the same time interval in the energy band in the ( 2.0 and 6.6 khz ) range in the same energy range are 2.9 % and 3.6 %, respectively, close to the value measured for ex
we investigate the growth of interarm features and clumps in self - gravitating gaseous disks of spiral galaxies, which extend over more than an order of magnitude in radius. our models are two - dimensional, represent the stellar spiral arms of a galaxy, and incorporate self - gravity and magnetic fields, which cause the formation of large - scale spiral patterns. we consider disk models with a constant toomre parameter @xmath0 ( or equivalently, with an initial surface density distribution nearly symmetric with respect to the disk plane ), and an externally imposed spiral potential. in our models, the spiral arms develop features such as feather - like structures that we refer to as interarm clumps, and subsequently ` ` spurs ''. these spurs have masses and spacings that are similar to those of clumps from galactic halos. we find that in low amplitude ( i.e. moderate ) spiral potentials, the instability initially grows in the innermost regions due to the predominance of free surface density and rotational shear. however, as the spiral potential is increased, the shear lessens, and the instability causes spiral shocks to grow in density and thickness. the perturbation separation is reduced, and eventually all the spiral structure is destroyed by the perturbed velocity field. in the presence of a strong spiral potential, the structure primarily arises from internal instabilities of hydrodynamic origin ; clumps and spurs form in the arms. the growth rate of these features is similar to that of structures without spiral structure, and is independent of whether they are associated with bound clumps or independent background features. clumps that grow in the arm can have masses of up to 2@xmath1 ; the corresponding clumps have the same masses as the actual spurs. the clumps also have similar spurs to those observed in the galactic feather features, and in some cases resemble elongated features that we identify with feather features. the bifurcation features near the locations of ultraharm resonances ( or superimposed on feather features ), occur only in disks with strong ( 10 % ) external potentials. we discuss the issue of whether interarm feathering is caused by internal or external perturbations, and whether it is consistent with star - to - star arm offsets and disk thickness variations. we also discuss the mass and spacing of arm / star separation in terms of clump / spur separations. our results suggest that clumps with a moderate degree of co - evolution and a short
this paper presents a numerically motivated calculation of the evolution of the masses and properties of central black holes, in order to bridge the gap between quasars and agn activity and explain the link between quasar and black hole evolution. we use a simple, physically motivated _ ab initio _ approach that takes into account the radiative efficiency of black hole accretion and the growth of the black hole mass function, while retaining basic properties of the quasar population. in this formulation, the main physical assumption is that black holes grow by accretion in advection - dominated ( adaf ) accretion at a rate strongly related to the eddington luminosity. the growth rate of black holes is defined in terms of two basic quantities : the probability that a black hole of mass @xmath0 accretes at a given rate and its comoving volume per unit mass, and the fraction ( to a given redshift ) of compact black holes that are active. under conservative assumptions about adaf accretion rates, we find that the average properties of active black holes in the local universe can be quite similar to those of the present day population of active galactic nuclei, with the transition between adaf and low efficiency accretion dominated accretion occurring at a relatively high fraction of supermassive black holes with massive black holes growing at too low rates to make the conventional adaf model inadequate. we show that, under the assumptions that adaf dominates at high redshift and that the local black hole population grows through a low accretion rate, the probability of a growing black hole with adaf efficiency less than some minimum value simply depends on the comoving space density of compact accreting black holes. we compute the luminosity function and the mass function for the entire mass range black hole masses range, and find that while the former depends weakly on the topology of the underlying dark matter distribution, the latter is quite sensitive to the details of recent star formation history of the universe. we compare our results to a wide variety of existing observations, and show that the most of the observed trends are reasonably well reproduced in our model, including the trend for the optical - uv - soft x - ray, far - ir, and radio - optical quasar luminosity functions to have peaks at low redshift ; we model these functions in a self - similar, though slightly different, form.
in this work, we present an exhaustive study of the _ restricted hartree fock _ ( rhf ) and _ mller plesset 2 _ ( mp2 ) intramethod methods for calculating the energy of the model dipeptide hco - l - ala - nh@xmath0, both at the restricted rhf level and at the mp2/6 - 311++g(2df,2pd ) level, using a large number of polymers with homo- and heterolevel bases. the study is based on the set of basis sets used by pople et al. in the literature, and, in particular, the homolevel ones. with respect to a reference molecule reference, the most accurate mp2-based matrix cells ( mcs ) are those in which the @xmath1-electron space has been truncated either by the use of extra polarizations or by the inclusion of diffuse functions ( in the latter case, via the lcao method ). the analysis is performed in two different ways : ( a ) by comparing the results obtained at rhf and mp2 limits, and ( b ) by performing a direct comparison of the results extracted from the fixed basis sets with different expansion and valence - splitting schemes. it is shown that the best way to compare the two methods is to perform a fast finite - size renormalization group ( fbr ) comparison, making use of the fact that, at mp2, the distance between the two approaches always decreases with increasing density. at the same time, the analysis indicates that the relative efficiency of gaussian basis sets in rhf is the most important variable that determines how much energy is needed to achieve a given mcs, and thus to determine the relevant observables for a given molecule, at the best possible approximation level. in other words, the accuracy of the rhf mcs is the main parameter of the analysis. this parameter is not well - defined in the study presented here, but it can easily be identified as one of the ones that should be used for quantifying the extent to which the small molecules are involved in a particular field of research. * keywords : * protein folding ; structure ; small molecules ; factoring ; assembly ; condensed matter physics ; methods : numerical
we theoretically and experimentally investigate the two - photon interference with continuous wave ( cw ) coherent light. we consider the superposition of electromagnetic waves and show that the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) dip with the visibility of @xmath0 can be observed while scanning the single - photon states is modified by two acousto - optic modulators, aom1 and aom2, which can slightly affect the phase coherence between two inputs. on the other hand, hom interference with the same output of the beamplitter is usually interpreted as a sinusoidal oscillation. however, under certain conditions, the recurrence of the first - order coherence can occur for a finite coherence time in terms of the quantum information science. we also provide a quantitative theoretical analysis for the multi - mode property of the hom dip. 10 g. jaeger, m. horne, and a. shimony, ` ` entangled photons, '' nature * 424 *, 847851 ( 2003 ). l. m. duan, y. sugimoto, j. a. b. gonzlez - daz, and n. l. mills, _ optical coherence and quantum optics _ ( springer - verlag berlin heidelberg, 2008 ). p. refregier, l. n. berg, o. painter, d. d. marks, a. s. stone, and p. r. hemmerich,``advances in quantum optics and quantum information, '' in _ proceedings of the ieee international conference on computers, systems, and signal processing ( bangalore, india, 1984 ), 175179 ( 2005 ). n. gisin, g. ribordy, w. tittel, and h. zbinden,``exact solutions for the problem of quantum interference, '' phys. rev. lett. * 69 *, 145195 ( 2002 ). j. j. briegel, h. g. lee, and r. blatt,``the quantum nature of light, '' * 21 *, 14761478 ( 1991 ). e. knill, r. laflamme, and g. p. milburn,``antiinterference between two photons based on entanglement, '' science * 312 *, 246255 ( 2001 ). m. aspelmeyer, t. jennewein, k. danzmann, and f. marquard
we study the quantum impurity model for a graphene @xmath0 ` impurity'exchange coupled to the conduction electrons of the host material, and demonstrate that it can explain the unusual quantum kondo effect and associated anomalous thermodynamic behavior of certain properties of the graphene system. a low - energy effective hamiltonian for the impurity is derived analytically and numerically within the numerical renormalization group of the anderson model. the ground state of the system is thus described by a fixed point of the effective density of states at the defect site, whose _ resonant _ quantum orbital is a spin-@xmath1 band localized at the vacancy site. the localized orbital acts as a potential scatterer, with both resonance and non - resonant eigenmodes contributing to the effective potential scattering. we study the interplay between the resonant quantum orbitals and the non - interacting conduction electron bath, and find that the renormalized potential scattering gives rise to a rich phase diagram, with a kondo - type of dual phase transition between a doublet and triplet powerlaw kondo state. in addition, we study dynamic quantities, focusing on the energy - dependence of the t matrix in the presence of the vacancy, and on the anomalous t matrices needed to explain certain experimental results. * quantum impurities in graphene have generated immense interest ever since their discovery by zhang and coworkers @xcite. indeed, graphene, a single layer of carbon, has, in the last few years, been heralded as a promising material for the observation of strongly enhanced properties of topological order and topology, including the quantum hall effect.@xcite in particular attention has been paid to the physics associated with a quantum version of the self - assembled quantum ` quantum graphene ', with isolated vacancies. recently, experimental advances in scanning tunneling spectroscopy and resistivity measurements have in fact found rather high kondo temperatures at its low - temperature quantum electrodynamics ( qed ), suggesting that graphene does indeed exhibit one of the novel properties of qed, i.e., a dynamical behavior exhibited by the vacuum, distinct from that expected from a conventional metal. two aspects of this qed behavior are at the heart of the remarkable experimental findings. first, since graphene does not break particle - hole symmetry, it provides a unique platform on which to experimentally test theories of quantum quantum physics at low energies. a considerable amount of theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to studying
we develop and study a general, stochastic model of a system of compartments within a trafficking pathway, and propose that this nonequilibrium open system self - organizes into golgi - like structures, i.e., into multiple, spatially resolvable aggregates with a position - dependent chemical composition. we consider the pure vesicular transport ( vt ) limit and an alternative limit of using aggregate movement to generate chemically polarized compartments, and find that the two limits lead to steady states with particles near the cis end and distinct b, c and d structures in the interior. the steady state structures mirror the spatial organization of the golgi cisternae ( a sort of hybrid system ). we identify conditions where the evolution of a cisterna into a trans golgi is qualitatively related to its ability to self - organize into distinct ` ` glicci '' structures, and we study the interplay of various dynamical processes in the model. we show that fission and chemical conversion are not regulated by the size of the trans compartments in our model, and that they respond to perturbations including ( i ) the mm - form of the flux kernel, ( ii ) exit block at the trans end, and ( iii ) uneven trans compartment partitioning. we find that cisternal movement leads to ` ` mixed '' fluxes both in the vt and cp limits, with diffusive and isotropic behavior. we propose experimental measurements to distinguish between these two types of fluxes and to probe the shape of the compartments at different distances from the mean flux. using these observations as constraints, we propose a method to discriminate between different transport mechanisms in a transparent way. in the absence of directed and specific fusion, our model suggests that specific fusion is less central to compartments with distinct chemical identities, as might be expected in a scenario where the dynamics is completely symmetric. however, our findings suggest that in the presence of an inherent asymmetry or directionality, as in the case of golgi apparatus, directed fusion can perhaps not play a significant role.
recent measurements of @xmath0 from the e821 experiment indicate an anomalous behavior in the measured value of this coefficient. within the standard model, this behavior can not be explained by charginos or the muon sneutrinos, yet is sometimes treated as a key component in the interpretation of the data. here we analyze the mass correlations in the susy eigenstates, and find that in the unified case, at least the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) can be a neutralino. this is an important result because it implies an upper bound on the sparticle masses which is not possible to remove with other approaches. we also analyze the sensitivity of our results to the choice of sparticle mass scale and to the size of the mixing between the charginos and the smuons. finally we discuss how these results can be exploited to better understand the dark matter problem. = -1 cm = -0.5 cm 1truecm * on the mass scales * + + 6truecm abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics + * for theoretical studies * + * at the center for theoretical study of the universe + * + euclid institute, university of california, berkeley, ca 94720 ; + pmssm international laboratory, po box 76, epping, nsw 1710 + * corresponding author, e - mail : i.s.salam@cern.phys.it + _ thee821 collaboration, in partnership with the physics division of the university of warwick, uk + + _ cern, department of physics, theory division, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland + + * dept. of physics & astronomy, columbia university, new york, ny 10003, usa + _ correspondence to : _ m.bulton@phys.columbia.edu + _ licensing provisions : _ none + _ programming language : _ fortran and cgi + _ memory required to execute with typical data : _ 200 kb + _ no. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc. : _ 3271 + _ keywords : _ supersymmetry ; general mssm + _ pacs : _ 14.60.pq, 14.80.kq
we report results from the ` ` ` noah-2 '' project on cataclysmic variables. this project has been designed to study the characteristics of short - term brightness variations and variability of this interesting object, h0538 + 608, which is a close binary with a red dwarf filling its roche lobe and a white dwarf. extensive ccd photometry have been obtained over more than 40 nights with changing filters ( vr, boao, 1.8 m, 2.6 m, 3.5 m and 5-color 10-photometry ), in order to determine orbital and spin periods of the magnetic white dwarf and to determine accretion structure of the system. we have removed corresponding nightly mean values of the color variations for the boao data, and derived the most accurate possible value of 0.058(18 ). the total number of 56 runs of observations has been obtained, providing more than 90 % of the total data set, and the detailed physical characteristics of the accretion flow can now be derived for this important object. for the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) telescope, we have obtained 56 runs with 10 pairs of ccd filters covering a wide range of effective periods. the mean value of the period for the light curve is @xmath0 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic one is systematic. the phase shift due to the application of the standard deviation correction for the period shift ( i.e. the rediscussion ) is seen in all runs, while the difference between the periods for the equal width of the ellipsoidal and total flux components is only visible for the very close run. the object has been found to be a close relative of the am her type star, and is a member of the growing group of intermediate polars stars ( or classical polars ) with rapidly spinning stars in synchronism. we present results of modeling all curves in extensive electronic tables. we conclude that the combination of the different types of variability seen in this object gives a good description of its observed light curve and suggests a strong dependence of the column density on the azimuthal magnetic field strength, the beat period and the orientation of its magnetic axis.
we prove that the cohomology of pure weil varieties over an algebraically closed field is isogenous. this is a consequence of a theorem of popa and schnell, which says that a picard scheme of finite type over a field preserves its isomorphism to a simple variety over the field. we give a different proof, using a different construction, of the same theorem. let @xmath0 be a smooth projective variety of dimension@xmath1. let the base field be a perfect field. as a first example, we consider smooth, projective varieties over a finite field whose cusp is the poincar reducibility of a yang series of rational coefficients. in this article, we are interested in whether the picard schemes of a certain yang variety are isogenous ( i.e., preserving the isomorphisms of the original varieties ) over the fields they are defined over, or if they are not. for both of these cases, there is a single consequence : the derived equivalence of the derived objects is isomorphic to a fourier transform. in section [ sec : psk ], we explain how to rigorously construct such a transform, and we give several applications, including pushforward, pullback, and tensor inversion, which are either universal or specific to yang varieties. to connect the two methods, we take a look at a recent paper by gompf @xcite, which gives a detailed exposition of the ( yang, de rham, singular, crystalline and crystalline tale cohomologies of planar varieties over finite fields ). in particular, we digress from the more general topic of derived equivalences by comparing the traces of the action of the frobenius morphism of these varieties to those of the albanese torsor of a particular variety. we then proceed to give a complete description of the construction of derived equivalent mukai transform using this method. theorem [ orlov.kernel.exist ] says that if a yugov plot of skew vectors is is isomorphously equivalent to a planar variety, then its pullback and pullback are isomorphic. using this argument, we construct an exact functor between yang vectors over an arbitrary field, and apply it to a variety over a certain field. our main result is the following. [ theorem]definition [ theorem1.1 ] states that yangiv rank four lattices over such a field are isomorphous to projective
we investigate the response of a high - concentration spherical stellar system to the perturbation induced by an unbound ( or fly - by ) interaction over a range of different galactic environments. fly by encounters penetrate the outer regions of a galaxy and can produce asymmetric morphologies like those observed in lopsided and warped galactic disks. we focus on the asymmetry parameter @xmath0, introduced by abraham et al. ( 1996a ) for spheroidal galaxies, and propose a generalization of the standard asymmetry parameters to account for the asymmetries produced. an external perturber can perturb the primary system in a manner that depends on the relative velocity and density of the environment. the lowest - order damped modes are the most important perturbing modes because their impact on the reaction of the system is negligible in the vicinity of the primary s pericenter and because of their low density and low velocity dispersion. we show that the maximum extent of the distortions is determined by the ratio of the relative velocities of encounters which we take equal to a gaussian with the dispersions equal to half the distance from the primary center of the galaxy. the halo distortions are significant and persistent even for dwarf interlopers. as a result, elliptical galaxies in groups and in clusters will show signs of recent or recent interactions. this is in agreement with the predictions of our perturbative solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation. we find that the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is a strongly decreasing function of the density and of the interaction velocity, in the sense that more massive perturbers produce more distorted morphologies. we discuss the implications of these results for the determination of the characteristic orbital parameters of galactic dark halos and for a variety of other galaxy types and propose an observational test of the mechanism proposed here. for example, galaxies in compact groups where the density is low and the velocity high are likely to produce signs of past and recent interactions while galaxies in environments characterized by high density, like compact groups, will not. an interferometric study of the persistent asymmetry produced during an encounter will allow us to test the theory explored here.

we discuss the interplay of atomic and quantum dynamics in coherent population trapping ( cpt ) regime. we show that the atomic system and the qdm system display expressive nonlinear behaviors in the presence of tunnelling process and probe fields, respectively. we especially discuss the effect of the dark state resonance, which modifies the dynamics of both systems in the limit of empty or filled cavity. we also point out the existence of an effective decay in the atomic cavity system, which is modified only for resonant probe field and can be decreasing with decreasing probe field, and show that it can give rise to a nonlinearity in the nonlinear optical response which is absent in a free space atomic system. finally, we discuss the relationship of the atom - cavity system to the quantum dot molecule system and find an expressive difference between them in the cpt regime. quantum dot molecules are able to support current nonlinear states of light that can not be described by the standard single quantum dot picture. the quantum dots present a non - trivial band gap in the optical spectrum, which presents interesting quantum mechanical features @xcite. in the last few years a considerable experimental effort has been put forward to gain a better understanding of such nonlinear phenomena. different types of molecules have been studied in the context, which can be roughly classified as atoms atoms or quantum dots, with the aim of understanding how the refractive index of a quantum dot depends on its environment. for instance, atoms form a two - level system ( eit ) in @xmath0-configuration, whereas qdm s form a three - state system. being the light emitting gas, eit can be regarded as a kind of mixed state, i.e., two interacting electron - hole pairs formed by the attractive coulomb interaction. the interaction between these two states is repulsive and leads to the entanglement of the electron hole pairs, giving rise to the emission of near - infrared photons. on the other hand, qdm lacks attractive interaction, but the attractive coupling between the two states can be modelled by the hamiltonian of a single electron hole. being a result of the eit, the atomic state is the faintest one in the all - optical readout, while qdm is the loudest one, as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] ( a ). in this case, the optically active edge states of eit are the most optically coherent states, so the optical susceptibility of atomic system is much stronger than that of the
the optical properties of the charge - ordered phase of the spinless holstein model are studied at half - filling in the adiabatic regime within the quasi - particle approach based on the three - dimensional ( @xmath0, \label{3r}.\ ] ] the peierls dimerization and the processes of phonon spontaneous emission by quasi - particles on a lattice is analyzed. the lattice distortions are predicted to play a prominent role in determining the infrared absorption of the system. the results of the optical absorption are in good agreement with experimental data for nickel - nickel compounds. in the last few years the study of the magnetic properties of transition metal oxides has shown important role in investigating strongly correlated electron systems. @xcite in particular, great progress in fabrication and characterization of high-@xmath1 magnetic materials has been made possible due to the advent of low - cost electronic devices that allow for very efficient electron - phonon coupling in the electronic structure of these materials both at the fundamental level and in the transport and the optical properties ( such as conductivity, infrared absorption and thermoelectric ). in many cases the electron and phonon degrees of freedom are coupled through a static lattice distortion allowing for the selective excitation of charge carriers on a rigid lattice by the action of the on - site coulomb repulsion preventing the formation of local pairs.@xcite as a result, in some cases a significant gap appears in the optical spectrum of the material enabling the charge carriers to be separated from the phonons by a sufficiently long distance optical phonon mode which leads to the complex optical spectra characteristic of fermi - liquid - like normal states. in spite of the extensive use of these optical properties in magnetic materials, it is still unclear how accurately they correlate with the electronic properties in these materials. in this paper we discuss the role of lattice lattice fluctuations in determining essential features of the electronic phase diagram and we show that in most cases they can be sufficient to stabilize a relatively weakly coupled spinless electron system in the half - filled regime of strong coupling. we report here an approximate estimate of the transition temperature for a nickel nickel sulphide with the kramers lattice in the ( i - th lattice ) through our approach in three dimensions ( 3d ) under different values of the electron transfer integral between nearest neighbor hopping constant and the constraint of the local oscillator. we find that for a weak coupling regime of the relativistic cubic lattice the transition
we study a nucleosynthetic model for the origin of the short - lived @xmath0nb(n,2n)@xmath1sm in the solar system. this nucleus, tr14, was produced by snia events close in time to the time when the galactic metallicity reaches the solar value, and is one of the few isotopes that has both a near - maximal production rate and a well - defined half - life. previous studies have shown that the nuclear contribution to the ism production process leading to the formation of the sun and mn is minimal. here we extend the study of tr14 to investigate if the abundance ratio for @x0nb and @xfig1sm nuclear to a solar isotopic composition is compatible with that of the radionuclide @asmath3mn. our models produce a range of values for the nuclear yield of the isotopes, ranging from that of snia, up to a factor of five, and three times the present lower limit of 5.4 myr. the large nuclear uncertainties allow us to derive even higher nuclear uncertainty, owing to the lack of accurate timescales for the latter two nuclides. the key element in our study is the nuclear rate derived for the production of the low - energy isotopes at a given proton - nucleus optical potential, which is relatively free from uncertainties related to the timing of the time of the birth of the galaxy. we find that the maximum rate of the convection - enhanced neutrino - driven version of the ccsn model ( 3-process ) is 3.7 myr, which represents a maximum rate consistent with the currently existing upper limit of 3.5 myr for the rate of 3mn in the ess. the nuclear uncertainties also lead to an upper limit for the ratio between the isotope - to - proton mass ratio and the total ism abundance for a fixed isotopic pair that is smaller than the current lower limit. we speculate that the observed variations in this ratio could be explained by varying the optical potential and/or mixing in the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ). combining our model results with snia nucleosynthesis yields a nuclear yield that is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that found in previous studies. we also note that the solar mn abundance derived by tr14 is inconsistent with that found using the snia models, and, given the current upper limits, is ruled out at the 95 % confidence level. # 1([#1
using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the thermodynamic signatures of the residue pairs ala - phe, ser - asn and lys - glu, which are found to stabilize each other in the presence of solvent entropy barriers. we show that in the @xmath0 solvent, these two can be considered as a special case of dzubiella s thermodynamic model, in which the hydrophobic interaction of a convex solute with a fully complementary concave surface is dominated by enthalpy. we find that when confined in the pore, the nonpolar solutes are hydrophobically adsorbed on to the walls, while the polar ends of the molecules remain hydrated, due to the favorable entropy of the system. we evaluate the entropic and enthalpic components of the potentials of mean force ( pmfs ) and interaction free energies of the pair of side chains and find that the contact minimum and the distant minimum at 2.5 nm in length are dominant for all three orientations. we also find that attractive interactions between the two side chains cause the desolvation barrier to be lowered, resulting in the long - standing contact minimum. these findings may have implications for the design and quantification of future water - based catalytic devices. solute - solvent interactions play a crucial role in a wide range of biological processes @xcite. for instance, the adsorption of biomolecules such as dna on water molecules is governed by water hydration, which in turn is the basis of many cellular functions such as metabolism, hydration and filtration. a key to understanding the origin of life on earth is understanding the interactions between water molecules. therefore, it is of great interest to understand the physical mechanisms by which these interactions arise, and to develop a method to test and optimize the efficiency of these interactions. in this context, membrane - associated proteins are often used to bind with water molecules because they can efficiently bind with just a few extra amino acids, and because salt bridges in proteins are strongly affected by the same conditions. a prominent example of this approach is the namd 2.6 protein, which consists of three amino acid molecules, ala, phe and rho, that are paired by extracellular polymers ( namd ), and can be viewed as the residue ring carbon ( sc ), closest to the c@xmath1 molecule for phenylalanine ring formation. in the early stages of life, the formation of this
the semi - classical theory of spin ( and angle resolved photoemission ) is applied to the quasi - two dimensional berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition of a spin-1/2 layered heisenberg antiferromagnet @xmath0. the rotational excitations of vortices / merons from the fragile magnons and multi - magnon composites contribute non - trivially to the spin - spin correlation. the non - conventional topological excitations give rise to a central peak " in the spin dynamics of the system. we perform a detailed calculation of the density functional theory ( dft ) associated with this central peak and compare it with the ins experiments performed on the material. our results highlight the inapplicability of the conventional vortex / meron gas phenomenology in the vicinity of the actual experimental locations. furthermore, it is shown that the value of dft obtained from the numerical simulations is in good agreement with the experimental data over the whole range of spin values. in view of these results, we suggest that a full quantum treatment of the bkt transition in layered anti - ferromagnetic systems is required. even in the lowest spin value regime, there exists a region of the parameter space over which we get acceptable values of dsf. the region which is not covered by the current ins experiments is identified as the region with the highest spin-@xmath1 correlation. for layered systems having low values of spin, the effect of meron dynamics on the dynamics is found to be larger than that of vortex dynamics. this leads us to consider the question whether it is possible to create vortex - meron gaseous phase with the low spin values, or not. finally, our calculations also predict the existence of a critical point ( above which the spin stiffness jumps discontinuously from all values below zero to zero above the critical value ) in some layered systems.
we study random oscillating fields in three - dimensional raman lattices using time evolving block decimation methods to simulate systems with quenched disorder. we find that the orthogonal magnetization disappears in response to a small variation of the field intensity, indicating the presence of a second order quantum phase transition. in agreement with this result, we also derive the entropy of entanglement and show that close to criticality, the block entropy decays to zero, as is expected for a nel product state. most physical systems ( in general ) undergo a phase transition around a freezing point. in the realm of condensed matter, this transition is refereed to as the @xmath0 phase transition, which is one of the most important quantum phase transitions of the modern universe @xcite. above a critical point, the collapse of all symmetries in the system produces a rich variety of ordered phases, including antiferromagnetic, mixed states, and superconducting states. a magnetic phase transition is typically accompanied by a rich number of non - vanishing schmidt coefficients, leading to large block entropy and hence large disordered field amplitudes. however, it has been difficult to realize such chaotic phases in solid state systems and to identify them with solid state quasiparticles. in three dimensions ( 3d ) systems, although well - known for short timescales, the physics of such systems has been largely hidden from the layman, partly because of the non - linearity in the hamiltonian ( which itself is induced by an external magnetic field ). in this paper, we study a system of ultracold atoms in a laser field, and demonstrate, for random fields, that the ground state of the system is a product state of two different coulomb interactions. this is a natural step in understanding the emergence of quantum order in strongly correlated systems, and we discuss how to realize these quantum phases in confining 3d lattices. the proposal below combines raman coupling for the spin chain with radio - frequency transitions to generate the desired structure of the hopping matrices ( details will be published elsewhere ). the main idea behind this scheme is to use the _ magic wavelength _ for the lattice to isolate and trap certain bosonic alkali atoms. we demonstrate that by using this scheme a mott insulator ( dio ) can be realized in a square lattice with arbitrary strength of external magnetic uni - axial random fields. the results of our simulations clearly show that the onset of dio leads to
we have used _ asca _ and _ rxte _ data to observe the nearby, low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ngc 4258. in agreement with previous observations by us, the x - ray spectrum is complex with multiple components arising from thermal plasma emission and, possibly, contributions from the underlying galaxy population. optically - selected gis data were cleaned to remove the remaining particle background and subjected to the following data - selection criteria : i ) the satellite should be at least 7 degrees above the earth s limb, ii ) the cor should be above the day - time earth limb, iii ) the local geomagnetic cut - off rigidity should be greater than 6gev / c, and iv ) the system should be radiatively - efficient ( advection dominated accretion flows ). modeling the thermal plasma as being from the surface of the accretion disk around a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black hole with the standard xspec software package, we derive abundances of c, ne, na, al, and ar in the central @xmath0kpc of the disk. we also determine the cluster redshift on the basis of the observed gis iron emission line. under the assumption that the observed line traces the viscous dissipation in the disk, we model the line emitting region as being located inside a region which is warped and/or cold. within about a hundred gravitational radii, the gis spectrum is well - fit by a thermal plasma model with a temperature of approximately 0.2kev and a photon index of 2 - 10kev ( depending on the energy of the additional thermal component ). we do not detect any significant iron k@xmath1 line emission from the agn. these results imply either flat emissivity ( as is commonly assumed in agn physics ) for the disk ( within the 90 % confidence level ) or a inner edge for the line - emitting region at greater than a hundred times the effective radius. = = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2=1pt psfig.sty accretion, accretion disks, galaxies : active, ( galaxies : ) galaxies : kinematics and dynamics x - rays : galaxies

we present a study of damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems ( dlas ) seen in the spectra of background quasars. the dlas offer direct probes of element abundances over @xmath13 of the age of the universe. in particular, the deficiency of refractory elements such as fe, mn, cr, etc., can be used to assess the possible reddening of the background quasar continua. here, we present new high - resolution observations of four dlas, two from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) obtained at the very large telescope ( vlt ) and one from the hubble space telescope ( hst ), with a total of 110 spectra. from these spectra, we derive metallicities which are amongst the most accurate known for quasar dlas. we confirm that the d - index is a good indicator of the presence of dlas among mg ii absorbers. our present sample adds new data to further constrain the shape of the metallicity - redshift relation for mg ii sub - dlas and for both the general dla and dla sub - populations studied here. given that the selection criteria for dlas are based on the strength of metal lines, these results indicate that the global mean dla metallic stays well below the solar level at all redshifts. however, the exact shape of that metallicitiy is still not accurately determined. in fact, only 2 dlas with a known n(hi ) have been measured at low resolution, a dla at z=0.68 ( de la varga & reimers 2000 ; pettini et al. 2006 ). on the other hand, there has been recent renewed interest in the detection of ca ii h and k lines in quasar absorbers and so these dlas may prove to be a promising tool with which to detect at low redshift a large fraction of the invisible dark matter.

we present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of 1203 metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) field stars in the solar neighborhood, based on a large revised catalog without kinematic bias. this catalog is by far the largest sample of metal - deficient field stars with available proper motions among any previously assembled non - kinematically selected samples. we first investigate the rotational properties of the halo at large heights from the galactic plane, using the corrected for the solar motion of the stars. the rotation direction is now clearly aligned with the galactic anticenter, rotation direction, and north galactic pole, and there is no evidence for an overlapping flattened or flattened halo, as was claimed by one of the authors. we also confirm that there exists _ no _ correlation between metal abundances and orbital eccentricities, which was previously claimed on the basis of a local sample. however, we find that the fraction of very low-@xmath1 stars with orbital eccentricity _ remains _ the same with increasing abundance, even at the lowest abundances explored in our sample. moreover, stars in intermediate abundance ranges _ exhibit a decrease _ of the orbital inclination with respect to that of the metal - rich population, which may be responsible for the near zero metallicity of at least a few stars in my sample. we further examine the orbital dynamics of our sample stars, and confirm previous results that the inner halo exhibits a significant _ orbital snithing _, in contrast to the generally accepted picture that the outer halo is quite round. we furthermore show that the recently discussed ` ` clump '' in the orbital - momentum diagram of halo stars is not due to the galactic peculiarities alone, but is due to a small contribution of a spheroidal component, which also contributes to the rotation. we finally discuss the implications of our results for models of the formation and evolution of the galaxy.
we have studied the clustering of the x - ray selected agns in the 0.4 deg@xmath0 _ chandra _ contiguous survey of the lockman hole northwest region. two methods have been used in our analysis : ( 1 ) the redshift - space correlation function is used as a major tool in our clustering analysis. it allows us to quantify the effect of redshift distortion in the sense that the correlation length at 1 mpc is given by @xmath1/\delta \log \sigma 1.7 $ ]. ( 2 ) the projected correlation function at 3 mpc based on the published data from the chandra deep field north ( cdfn ) is used too. it gives us a clustering signal for pairs of galaxies at a mean redshift of 0.31.0. in both fields, the correlation function over a spatial scale of 3 rpc is found to have a power - law slope of @xfig1/3rd, and hence is consistent with the correlation amplitude found in optically detected quasars. we have also studied the correlation functions using the projected emission line ( ee ) correlation function. using this, we find a weak correlation between clustering and luminosity. we find this to be due to the different luminosity coverage in the two fields, or to errors in our model. after evaluating the possible causes of the weak correlation, we conclude that there are no significant correlations between luminosity and clustering except for a weak one at low luminosities where the relation is degenerate. the properties of agns on large scales are found to be similar to those of local galaxies. this suggests that agns trace the violent growth phase of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and hence provide a link between the dark matter halo and the cosmological structure. using the equivalent width of broad emission lines as mass estimator, we found that the best - fit parameters for the real - space
we present follow - up observations of a sample of unidentified _ xmm - newton _ slew survey x - ray sources with the _ swift _ satellite. we attempt to classify the sources using published optical, near infrared and radio data. cross - correlation with the rosat pspc all - sky survey shows that of of order 50 % of the slew survey point - like sources do not have catalogued counterparts. using the most recent clean slew catalogue we find that 97 sources, of which 58 are detected with pointed observations ( with a 90 % confidence level upper limit of 2.9@xmath0 ). a further 30 sources are distributed apparently randomly across the sky, including one periodic variable star and 2 high proper motion stars. the majority of these are likely to be highly variable sources, and the non - detected population is consistent with an agn classification. the sample exhibits significant variability, with flux changes of up to a factor @xmath4300 between pointed and un - detected observations. we argue that a significant fraction of the xrt detected sources are highly variable and that the samples of xrt- and/or bat - detected sources contain a diverse population of sources. the issues of source confusion and spurious detections are discussed, with it likely that some sources are truly variable and others are truly non - detections. we also estimate that about one - third of the _ xrt _ detected sources will be spurious which leads to an estimate of the fraction of bright sources in the field being only 3 - 4 %. we suggest that most of the spurious sources are likely nir bright objects which have been boosted by bright optical and near infrared sources. we conclude that any of the above sources tested physically can be identified as a highly variable agn. the source counts and fluxes we derive are consistent with the nir - bright component of a population of agn with bright optical / near infrared counterparts. surveys galaxies : active x - rays : galaxies galaxies : seyfert
we investigate the nuclear - physics implications of the neutrino - driven wind ( hew ) of cc - sne for the nucleosynthesis of xe - h isotopes. our hew model consists of a superposition of s, y, and r - process components, which are coupled via the neutron - freezeout mechanism via a so - called ` ` actinide boost ''. we perform a systematic statistical study of the whole astrophysics parameter space for a ` ` standard '' hew parameter combination of y@xmath0 = 0.45, keeping the electron fraction ( 0.40 @xmath1 0.495 ) constant and the expansion velocity ( 1000 km / s ) constant ; and taking into account the full respective entropy ranges. after parameterization, we vary the individual equation of state ( e.g. expansion velocity, entropy ) for possible r - processes with different ejection velocities ( ` ` hot, fast '' version ) ; and vary also the individual parameter of the hew expansion velocity with respect to the corresponding full s - ranges. we find satisfactory agreement between the best - fit theoretical n - physics input and the observational data for the whole s - range. moreover, we argue that the recent measurements of the xe / h abundance ratio in r - rich ` ` sneden - type '' stars favor a rapidly - spinning, neutron - rich hew ejecta. we conclude that the high neutron - richness of such ejecta may be the reason for the existence of the rapid, ` ` cold '' neutron - process process already in the early universe. nucl. phys. b * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3#4#1, _ phys. rev. _ * d#2***#3**+*#4*&*#5*#1 # 2 a&a, # 1 ` ` ` supernova progenitors '' ; m. f. s. lundeen, g. d. thomson, s. bergamini, b. h. weiss, y. weihs, + a. zeilinger, a. v. sergienko, and y. z. wiederhecker, eds.

we present an analysis of the central morphology of an unbiased sample of 81 nearby brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) with an elliptical galaxy morphology. the images were taken in the @xmath0 band with the _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 camera. the central surface brightness profiles were fitted with the so - called nuker - law parameterization. following previous authors we classified the profile identifications on the basis of the fit parameters and visual inspection of the profiles. we identified 53 galaxies ( 88 % of the sample ) as ` ` core '' galaxies ( these have a shallow cusp and a well - defined break ), six galaxies ( 10 % ) as power - law _ galaxies _ having a steep profile all the way into the center, and one galaxy ( 2 % ) that has an ` ` intermediate slope. '' we have also examined the way in which the profiles are related to the global properties of the bcgs and their host clusters. the results are in accord with previous studies that indicate that bright elliptical galaxies have shallow core - type profiles. our study underscores this result by showing that cores are dominant in the highest luminosity galaxies, which by the virtue of their central position in galaxy clusters accrete significantly even at the present epoch. the matching of the core - types with galaxy properties, as measured by the h@xmath1 equivalent width, morphology, and radio power, is consistent with the hypothesis that the formation of a core is associated with the accretion of a binary black hole and the subsequent merging of the merging galaxies. this is supported by the fact that the seven galaxies with a steep brightness profile or intermediate - slope profile appear to be physically different from core galaxies. we find that the core sizes and the fractions of galaxies having small to intermediate - size cores are correlated with the cluster velocity dispersion and with the x - ray luminosity of the galaxy. however, the correlation between the core size and the cluster luminosity does not appear to correlate with the core type or the position in the color - magnitude diagram. we interpret these results as direct evidence that the processes which shape the centers of giant ellipticals should be most easily observable in core galaxies, rather than isolated remnants from galaxy mergers. in addition, our study demonstrates that the presence of a central black hole may significantly limit the consequences of a non - negligible three - body black hole competition in the early stages of galaxy formation. the present small fraction of bcgs with small cores may be consistent with this hypothesis. we discuss the implications of our
we have searched for redshifted neutral hydrogen 21 cm absorption toward five sources from the stickel et al. ( 1996a ) red quasar sub - sample using the new uhf system at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ). the observations are intended to address a number of outstanding issues : ( 1 ) the question of whether some agns are intrinsically red, rather than dust - reddened, emission spectra ; ( 2 ) the fraction of quasars missing from optical samples due to dust obscuration due to intervening dust ; ( 3 ) to the degree to which high column density absorption line systems may be associated with the quasar, and ( 4 ) the nature of the ` missing'quasar population. assuming that the hi 21 cm line at z = 0.67150 is accessible at 250 mhz, we find 80@xmath0 detections toward four of the five sources. this detection rate is significantly higher than in optically selected quasar samples, providing circumstantial evidence of the presence of dust along the line of sight. the third source is unresolved, and we deduce that this source is a low redshift ( z @xmath1 0.5 ) radio galaxy at a redshift of 0108 + 388. if the identity of the radio source is correct, this implies that there are at least two distinct populations of galaxies at high redshift associated with this object : low surface brightness agns and agns with extended, milli - arcsecond scale emission. the low detection rate toward zero - redshift sources, together with the high signal - to - noise ratio and the near infra - red quality of the data, suggest that a significant fraction of the galaxies in this sample are not associated with a bright point source. such a fraction is potentially large, and may have significant effects on the redshift distribution of ` quasar'selected samples. * keywords : * galaxies : active galaxies : evolution galaxies : ism radio continuum : galaxies interferometers
this paper is devoted to the derivation of a macroscopic model for a new type of combined individual based model where individuals control their motion by changing the curvature of their trajectory. the model, called the persistent turning walker ( ptwa ), is a one - parameter model. it is based on the assumption that individuals move at constant speed and align to the average velocity of their neighbors ( up to a certain stochastic uncertainty ) at each time step. a time - continuous version of this dynamics has been recently derived by @xcite. the present work is the first one in which interaction among the agents is taken into account within this kind of models. we introduce interactions between individuals by means of a generalized collisional invariant and we provide a closed set of equations for this model at large scales. the problem for this derivation is that there are no conservation laws enforcing energy conservation in the present model. indeed, in this model, the dimension of the manifold of local equilibria is much larger than the space of collisionally invariant. conservation laws are therefore missing for providing a closure of a large time and space resolution of the problem. in order to overcome this problem, we use the notion of generalized collisionality invariant which is newton s second law. the resulting system is a non - conservative hyperbolic which shows similarities but also striking differences to the euler gas dynamics. the corresponding problem is solved by the use of scaling variables. we numerically estimate the involved coefficients and we show that this model is qualitatively similar to the vicsek model ( or the ptw model ). by contrast, the inclusion of the alignment rule modifies drastically the dynamics of this model. the result of the paper is the proof of a theorem of kappa et al. which states that the microscopic hydrodynamic system exhibits diffusive behavior with a constant number of fm - fm converges. this microscopic behavior can be seen as a diffusive scaling between the particle density and the local average velocity. numerically, we perform a numerical proof of this result by computing the convergence and the rescaling of the macroscopical solution for the fisher dynamical system. _ _ @xmath0 competence center for modeling birds and fish, estuary university, p.o. box 43100, los alamos, new mexico _ + e - mail : kappa@fis.ep.up.mx _
we investigate the failure behavior of three distinct systems whose rigidity, measured by different geometric parameters, can be systematically controlled prior to the application of stress. by comparing these three systems, we can isolate effects due to the material s geometry from those due to disorder. we find diffuse failure in the two lowest rigidity systems ( at @xmath0 ) due to meandering of the crack structure. in the high rigidity system, we identify a crossover between meandering and stretching in the small-@xmath1 system. we show that the crack width increases with increasing degree of disorder, while the stretching energy and bulk modulus decrease. upon lowering the parameter, the shear modulus first starts to decrease and subsequently starts to increase. these results are in general agreement with experiments. as the rigidity of a material increases, it tends to yield a wider and narrower failure zone. most of the material that we consider as a material is brittle @xcite. however, there is a small amount of brittle, non - magnetic, materials that have a high degree of roughness and structural disorder. among these is the honeycomb lattice, composed of a square lattice of point masses connected by equal - stiffness harmonic springs, which has been successfully used as a model system to study the failure of elastic networks. this lattice is lattice - thin, has a triangular - shaped crack structure, and is under - constrained by the uniaxial pulling direction. we model the elastic network by a random collection of bonds of different stiffness, arranged in a haphazard manner so that the coordination among the bonds ranges from 0.1 to 1 in approximately 1 passbands. the random network is prepared by randomly removing bonds with highest coordination from an initial, highly - compressed packing of spheres. we explicitly solve newton s equations in the presence of microscopic dissipation. when the uniformity of the bonds is uniform, the system is more rigid than when the states - of - self - stress are sparse. the most naive approach we adopt is to try to scale two systems with different rigidities so that if the density of states -of - self- stress are the same, then it is assumed that the local connectivity is nearly the same. ( we will refer to a regime where randomness is important and we will study this regime elsewhere. )

we study the effects of a magnetic field on the purely hydrodynamical evolution of cloud collisions ( ccs ) between unevolved clouds, using high resolution, mhd two - dimensional numerical simulations. the simulations have been performed within the framework of the ideal mhd code. the main results of our study can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the final fate of the cloud ( dispersal, coagulation, shattering, filamentation ) depends on the magnetic field orientation along the direction of cloud motion. for symmetric and asymmetric clouds an intense transverse magnetic field is seen to be suppressed in the hd case, both for the low and high cloud velocities, when the magnetic shield is highly asymmetric. this leads to a kolmogorov - smirnov transition, where the reverse shock propagates toward the inner region of the expanded cloud gas. ( ii ) in the radiative case, the cloud kinetic energy is modified by about a factor of 5 compared to the non - magnetic case. this is due to the asymmetric deflection of the magnetic flux along the line of sight. ( iii ) for hd clouds a magnetic reynolds number, re@xmath0, is found to be large ( @xmath1 ) both in and co diffuse clouds. it increases at the end of the simulation when the cloud velocity is about 60 % of its initial value and when the field lines are well coupled with the neutrals. in these cases the field should not decay through the amorphous thermal phase, but it will re - expand due to ambipolar diffusion. ( iv ) for fully symmetric clouds a reexpansion phase developed in the strongly asymmetric case, which results in formation of a very thick magnetic sheet, can be qualitatively well representative of an adiabatic mhd cloud. its re - expansion phase is caused by destruction of the lower bound molecular cloud layer by the strong magnetic field. using the results of ( v ) we are able to identify the most obvious and simplest behaviors that lead to the appearance of kelvin - helmholtz ( khi ) and rayleigh - taylor ( rti ) instabilities in the cloud surface along the transverse direction. these results have to be confirmed by more extended 3d calculations, which will, in due course, include also instabilities along the azimuthal direction, which are suppressed in 2d flows. however, the results presented in this paper represent only an initial attempt to study a complex problem
we report new measurements of the projected rotational velocities, n(@xmath0 ), for stars of spectral type b0.5-b3 within 1 - 5 myr of the stars that are members of expanding ob associations sco - cen, i lac, and orion ia, b, and c. the data have been obtained from a large survey of late - type stars ( 6 myr to 15 myr ) in six of these associations ( sco ob2, upper scorpius, upper centaurus - lupus, and lower centaurus crux ). when combined with results in the literature for stars in the same mass range, we show that : ( 1 ) the distribution of projected rotation speeds is broad, with stars having as low as 400 km / sec. ( 2 ) the rotation speeds among early b stars in rich regions are typically higher than those of their field counterparts. ( 3 ) the young stars in low density regions have higher rotation speeds than the old stars in high density regions. however, the difference in mean rotation speed between the two groups is only slightly ; h and @xmath10 per appear to be the same for the two different age groups. in order to increase the sample size for comparison with studies of field stars, we have also supplemented new data for a cohort of very slowly rotating b stars with information on the locations of existing associations and the histories of their birthlines. we find that the cluster stars have rotation speeds that are significantly different from the corresponding field stars. no difference is found between the distributions for the field stars and the young cluster stars. we interpret these differences as evidence of angular momentum evolution and differences in initial angular momenta, related in some way to the environment in which the stars formed. the differences between the rotational velocity distributions of the cluster and field stars might be attributed to the differences in the initial angular momentum of the forming stars, and their consequent short protostellar collapse times. we conclude that those differences do not reflect evolutionary changes in the nature of star - forming cores, but rather are likely due to the dynamics of the accretion process, with the more massive stars in clusters rotating at 0.1 - 0.3 breakup but well above the zero age main sequence.
we report on late time observations of the extremely luminous and peculiar type iin / iia supernova ( sn ) 2006gy with the subaru telescope. the sn was clearly seen in the nir images obtained with the adaptive optics on the keck ii telescope, while any optical observation failed to detect the sn component even for h@xmath0 emission. the @xmath1 band light curve ( lc ) turns into a shape which becomes flatter as the light curve fades. features in the late phase spectrum are distinct from those in the early phase spectrum, which suggests an ongoing interaction between the sn ejecta and the dense circumstellar medium ( csm ). the lack of an intermediate - width line around 5200, which is seen together with 7155 in type ia sne as well as in the peculiar type ic sn 1998bw, suggests a very low density of the emitting region. the lc of sn 2006gy fades very slowly, with a decline rate faster than that of other sne. we suggest that the luminosity is powered by radioactive decay rather than the usual recombination front, although the latter possibility can not be ruled out. if the radioactive decay is the main heating source of the peak luminosity, the required mass of radioactive decay in the ejecta is more than 20 times larger than that in type ii sn of the same luminosity. we also find that the electron density in the innermost region is surprisingly low, consistent with the low expansion velocity of the sn. this suggests that the ` pure'radioactive decay model is not the correct one for sn 2006y. a complete analysis of the optically luminous sn ( 2005hk ) spectra at 240, 480, 750, 8100 and 8500 is necessary to disentangle the different heating mechanisms and to discard the presence of the ` isotropic'emission from the csm. the high luminosity and slow decline rate during the period of very high energy emission support the hypothesis of low density ejecta of type iip supernovae being the primary source of heating in these objects.
we analyse the dynamics of a circumplanetary disc as an accretion disc in the presence of tidal forces from the central star. the planet opens a gap in the disc when the planet reaches a mass of order neptune s mass. gas infalling through the gap gains angular momentum about the planet, while the planet conserves angular momentum in a steady - state manner. the gap structure is determined by the properties of the dynamical flow within the gap. we consider ballistic particle orbits, one - dimensional simulations and analytic models. we also include the effects of gas pressure through some smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations. the specific angular momentum of the infalling gas is shown to determine the disc structure. if the planet has opened a gap, a disc extends up to a stellar radius of @xmath0. the radius is then the location of orbit intersections or instability that occurs at a radius slightly smaller than the effective disc radius ( inside of which most of the mass is located ). the behaviour of the disc is then different from that of a cold disc that extends to a similar radius. we argue that the relative size of a disc seen in the simulations is not due to the planet s angular momentum, but rather to the tidal truncation effects. the disc angular momentum is redistributed by viscous torques within the truncation radius, and the total disc surface density at the disc boundary is found to be approximately constant. we find that the radial surface density of a low ionisation disc is significantly higher than that of the nearby circumstellar disc gas. this implies that at least for circumstellar discs near the edge of the roche lobe of the companion star, the circumplanolar disc may serve as a significant reservoir of mass - losing gas. we postulate a possible evolutionary scenario for the late stages of giant planet formation, in which the planet becomes fully embedded in the gaseous disc that is hosted by the star.

we present the first optical study of the stellar population of the pegasus dwarf galaxy, based on wfpc2 observations obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). our f555w ( v ) and f814w ( i ) images penetrate to a radius of @xmath0 ( 62@xmath1 kpc ), which covers much of the optical galaxy ( cf. aparicio et al. 1995, aparcely et. al. 1996 ) and the wiyn 3.5-m telescope. we analyze the resulting color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to derive a historical overview of the star formation history ( sfh ) of the galaxy. our cmds are sufficiently deep to allow us to analyze the mean star formation rate ( sfr ) over more than 5 gyr in a single stellar mass range, and we find that the mean sfr has varied between roughly constant and modest declines over the past few gyr. the recent sfr was highest for the most of the sfr, then lowest for the last 4 gyr, then starts to decline at the present. we confirm that star formation is ongoing at a low level but has produced at least one hii region, a blue ms, several blue core heb stars, and a few red giant branch stars. the density of these stars indicates that the bulk of the population has been formed between 1 and 2 gyr ago, with the majority originating from the very youngest stars now on the main sequence ( ms ). the presence of young, evolved red stars on the rgb indicates that there is a significant non - stellar population present at the main sequences of the rgb, although we can not rule out a contribution from an older stellar population with a lower mean age. the most distinctive feature of the current sfr is a pronounced red plume extending from the base of the giant branch and to the blue loop, which is clearly detected for the first time in wiyn images. this and other features, such as a lack of extended stellar coverage, indicate that the extended agb is an important reservoir of hi which has been depleted by the recent star burst.
we present a deep, high - redshift catalog of candidate galaxies selected from the eso / vlt hawk - i archive using the lyman - break selection technique to look for star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 and @xfig. we use observations of the vlt / isaac goods - south field obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and the vista telescope compact array ( cta ) onboard the hubble space telescope in the f439w, f555w, and f814w filters and an additional 20.7 arcmin@xmath1 of ground - based data in the b34 band. our catalogues are completeness independent. of the 133 candidates we have identified, 98 per cent are matches to real galaxies and 16 per cent of them are likely to be ghost image haloes around bright stars. we also analyse the rest - frame uv luminosity function derived from model spectral breaks ( a sharp cutoff ) assuming a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function. comparison of the theoretical predictions and the number of candidates we find suggests that the predicted number of ` ` dropouts '' is too high by at least a factor of two. the implied evolution is such that the average luminosity of dropout galaxies in the redshift range 0.2 - 3.0 is @xcite, which may indicate a significant contribution to the cosmic uv background light from reionization. comparison with the expected numbers of dropouts from models indicates that much of the difference in stellar mass loss and metallicity is due to dust reddening and/or star formation in the host galaxies at these redshifts. from the best - fitting models, we find that there is some evidence for evolution in the number density of drop - drop galaxies from 0.1 to 0.4, but that most of the evolution is likely to have been caused by an expansion of the dark matter halo in the early universe. if the evolution observed in the uv is accounted for in our luminosity functions, then there must be at least two modes of evolution of the mean effective star - formation rate from the time of first light to z=1.5, with both modes contributing to the observed evolution. if we require a pure power - law evolution, as suggested by some recent results from cosmological reionisation simulations, then a period of significant evolution in both modes must occur between z=2 and z=3.

we report the continuous and pulsed loading of a slow and cold atomic beam into a magnetic guide. the apparatus is based upon a four - beam laser configuration similar to the one used for the study of optical lattices. it employs an auxiliary two - dimensional magneto - optical trap that confines the atoms transversally before they enter the guide. however, for low atomic velocities, the atoms are strongly heated in the longitudinal direction. this limitation does not occur in another coupling method which relies on magnetic confinement in the transfer zone. for this purpose, we have constructed a miniature magnetic guide ( mmg ) between the injecting mot and the standing wave macro - structure on a conical supporting structure. the mmg allows the production of a very low velocity beam in the magnetic guide provided that they are in a magnetic sublevel corresponding to a low - field seeking state, thus reducing the confining force of the long magnetic guide to its asymptotic value. we now present the experimental results that we have obtained concerning the characteristics of the guided atomic beam. in the first part of the paper, we describe the setup a, i.e. with a vapor - loaded injecting mot, and we determine the transverse temperature in the range of 1 - 2 mk using the measurement of the longitudinal velocity distribution. we further report the results of the recent developments concerning the transfer of cold atoms into the magneticguide. in particular, we show that the auxiliary mot can be used to transfer a bunch of atoms, which pass through the @xmath0 mm barrier, into the msg. we finally describe the results concerning the coupling of a probe beam and the longitudinal atomic motion, which have both been measured in the experiments performed so far. address = max - planck - institut fr festkrperforschung, heisenbergstrae 1, d-70569 stuttgart address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via emilio bianchi 46, i-23807 merate ( lc ), italy address = theoretische physik, eth - hnggerberg, ch-8093 zrich address = nagoya university, inogaya, magawa state key laboratory of precision spectroscopy, department of physics, jagellonian university, + ul. kawiory 26, 30 - 055 cracow, poland address = faculty of mathematics and physics, university of ljubljana, + jadranska
the identification of faint rr lyrae stars is one of the most crucial aspects of modern optical astronomy, yet there is no study of the properties of sources variable on long time scales from the optical to the infrared. the lack of detailed information for individual objects allows studies of the long term variability of the extragalactic background light ( i.e., quasars ). by necessity, such studies are based on a small number of observations of the same objects, used to constrain the ensemble properties of a sample of sources. photometric measurements of stars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are a valuable tool for selecting variable sources, and are crucial for robust algorithms for selecting and studying such sources. here we compare the selection efficiency of the sdss - poss method for selecting candidate variable sources with that used in the publicly available palomar digital sky surveys ( poss i and poss ii ). we demonstrate that the photometric errors in public poss catalogs can be reduced by a factor of @xmath010 ( rms ) by using sdss photometry to recalibrate the poss photometry. the resulting error distribution is gaussian, and the resulting fractional error of the variances of faint optical sources is reduced from the order of 10@xmath1 to less than 1 %. we use variances measured in the different poss bands of the four sdss imaging bands to analyze the distribution of quasar rms variability and the quasar structure function as a function of luminosity, rest - frame wavelength, and time lag in the observer frame. we find that the variability amplitude measured using both sdss and the fisher information is greater than 5 mag for luminosity ( 0.60.24.6 mag ), and 0.35 mag for time ( 4 years ) lags, and that it is significantly larger for lags longer than 1 year. the longest time lags ( up to 2 years ) are observed in the poss i catalog alone, and for which we derive a power - law dependence of variability with luminosity and wavelength. we conclude that _ the characteristic time scale for optical variability measured with sdss data is of the order 1 year in the rest frame for galaxies, and is only weakly dependent on wavelength and luminosity. we present a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of the reddening of faint quasar candidates in the 5-band and 4-band sdss color - color diagrams, and determine the completeness of known structures in the milky way
a simple and illuminating formula for the rate of decoherence of a quantum system, as derived from the interaction of the system with its surroundings, is derived. the formula is interpreted as a direct consequence of the ` ` adiabatic inversion '' of the two - level system, which suggests a way of turning the quantum mechanical world ` ` on '' during a one - time experiment. although this idea has been around for years, it was rather recently recognized by some authors that ` ` quantum computers are very close to their classical counterparts '' @xcite. moreover, one can see the possible universality of the quantum rules when one could demonstrate the meaningfulness of quantum linear combinations of these two states. such linear combinations can in principle be produced since there is some amplitude for a tunneling between the two configurations. one of the most interesting examples of this is the free particle which, in the limit of an infinitely large ` ` box '', is described as a system of continuous, dense, levels. a number of authors have automatically assumed, in talking about this system, that at long times the particle under the influence of some continually interacting environment becomes totally ` ` decohered '' ; in the sense that the density matrix of the particle approaches the situation of no off diagonal elements. this would be a beautiful experiment, the main open question being if the estimates of the rate are in fact realistic. since we are entering a realm which has not been explored before, we expect the particle in a thermal environment to be described by the boltzmann factor, to be fitted to a density matrix where the unitary values are 1, 0, 1 and 2 @xmath0, and, possibly, to have a pattern of values on the state space which ` ` drives the system ''.
we develop a comprehensive analytical model for coupled plasmonic systems and use this to understand the properties of gold nanoparticles in the ultrasmall gap regime. the model is applicable to any gap with a finite conductance, and is only marginally dependent on the nanoparticle size. importantly, the impact of conducting links on the resonance condition is also understood. 10 n. bachelard, j. andreasen, s. gigan, and p. sebbah, ` ` plasmons in cell membranes, '' nature * 424 *, 847851 ( 2003 ). t. chanelire, d. bouwmeester, a. krause, m. corkum, and j. javanainen,``nobreak eschert - forschungen ber den unterschied von lumineszenz - und temperaturstrahlung, '' phys. rev. lett. * 98 *, 213904 ( 2004 ). j. huang, e. a. hinds, n. j. cerf, and l. p. wang,``plasmonics in cells : a review, '' physical review letters * 83 *, 28292843 ( 2006 ). c. cohen - tannoudji, _ quantum information with condensed matter _ ( cambridge university press, 2000 ). w. d. phillips, _ statistical mechanics _ ( springer verlag, 1983 ). r. hillebrand, z. t. chen, w. c. oates, and n. f. nichols,``high - frequency resonances of metallic nanostructures, '' opt. express * 20 *, 15471549 ( 1999 ). h. benisty, c. qiang, x. jiang, and s. yu,`` screened coupled dimer plasmon resonance in metallic cavities, '' new j. phys. * 14 *, 043024 ( 2005 ). f. arjondo, t. lujan, e.- mail : r.arjona@nus.edu.cn. a. bhamra, a former head of atomic and molecular physics at the university of crete, has recently moved into the condensed matter physics community where he is a professor and head of the department of physics, university of southampton, + southampton so17 1bj, uk.. e - mail : f
we present the first near - infrared spectroscopic observations of the very low - mass star wise j0720@xmath00846. these were obtained with the nirspec echelle spectrograph on the keck ii telescope, as part of a dedicated astrometric campaign, and provide the first opportunity to study the physical properties of this source in the context of multiplicity among late m dwarfs in the immediate vicinity of the sun. spatial kinematics confirm the presence of persistent light, and we identify it as an old, magnetically active source with an ( unresolved ) period of 24 yr. we find that the mass ratio of this system is highly age - dependent, with 0.47 @xmath0 0.87. if the possible source detected in our nirc2 images is the companion, an inertial orbit measurement should be achieveable in 25 yr by combining astromometric and radial velocity monitoring. we detect no 6708 li i absorption in these data or the co - added high resolution spectrum, and derive an upper limit on the neutral hydrogen column density of the system of 0.02 solar masses ( assuming a salpeter imf ). astrometry reveals a weak tangential motion around the mean position angle of the binary, and a possible spin - orbit. multi - epoch radial velocity measurements identify this source as a spectral binary with t - type companion, at an assumed separation of 1.8 au. we discuss the implications of these results for the population of t and y dwarfs with late - m primaries in the nearby solar neighborhood, and in particular for the frequency of t dwarf companions to very low mass stars by the time our observations are published. we note that despite the relatively high number of t dwarfs found to late m primaries, the disk activity of this subtype is remarkably low, as a fraction of the total late m dwarf population ( up to 2 % ) shows up as a power - law above the mean activity level. hence, we conclude that the long - term rotational and magnetic activity characteristics of this late - l / early m dwarf are likely to be dominated by the slow - cooling component of its underlying population of brown dwarfs.
let @xmath0 be a finitely generated non - abelian free group. given a graph of spaces, called the _ graph of groups _, it is said to have _ local retractions _ if the fundamental group of the graph has at least one finite - index subgroup of rank at least 2. ( in analogy to the seifert van kampen theorem see, for example, @xcite. ) a group is called _ separable _ if it is an intersection of quasi - isometrically embedded subgroups of a finite group of groups. in this paper we address the problem of finding subsets of a group being separable if and only if its fundamental group is separable. we give a partial answer to this question in the form of a special case of the _ extended centralizer extension _ theorem, which characterizes the closing of finite centralizers as free groups that are extended by centralizers. the main result of this paper is a new proof of three theorems of the well - known results in the area of subgroup separability and separability of graphs of groups, improving on three previous ones in the same area. the motivation for this article is to extend our recent work on the _ immersions of graphs _ to graphs of spaces. our main result is to state that for every finite generated subgroup ( or, equivalently, for every closed centralizer ) there exists a finite - sheeted cover and, in particular, a retractable subgroup associating to it ; in particularitely generated subgroups. the results in this article are inspired by the work of stall, hall and libchaber, as well as by recent developments of luengo, pavlov and vinogradov, while also being of interest in their own right. several of our results are based on the particular case of a connected complex, while others are motivated by examples from the combinatorial theory of trees. for instance, we show that every finite subcomplex of a tree can be embedded into an ice group by a local - retraction free group and, using this analogy, we extend the theorem of stall s theorem to free groups and edge groups. * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 60k37, 60j25, 60k35, 82c20, 03c25, 02c25. * keywords and phrases : * group, group separability, locality, retractions, su(2 ), extreme right - handedness. * ams
we study the phase diagram of a @xmath0li - k@xmath1k mixture with bragg scattering and show that both the normal gas and the inhomogeneous superfluid phases are completed in a continuous fashion. we calculate the thermodynamic potential and obtain an exact solution for the cubic superfluid phase diagram. we show that the phase transition from the normal state to the superfluid is driven by the landau free energy of the system, with a negligible contribution from the population imbalance. in the case of the continuous superfluid we obtain the energy eigenmodes for the bogoliubov quasiparticle wavefunctions, which are the locus of the lowest excited levels in the system. we give an expression for the green s function in the bosonic complex pairing field, which contains the homogeneous dispersions of the larkin - ovchinnikov phase. during the past few years a great deal of work has been devoted to the study of systems that undergo a continuous phase transition, such as high - temperature superconductors, superfluids or crystalline phases, in order to understand how they transform from the weakly interacting normal gas to the strongly interacting bcs superfluid regime. the transition between these different phases is usually described by a ginzburg - landau equation, where the critical temperatures and values of the free energy are determined via a landau constant @xcite. recently, starting from a toy model of a two - component fermi gas, it has been realized that there are phases with two possible states, which can be regarded as the normal and superconducting, although they are not necessarily superfluid, see fig. [ toy model ] ( a ) a normal phase with a broken translational symmetry and bose - einstein condensation is created inside a superconductor ; ( b ) a phase with three broken symmetries is realized, where anharmonic and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) symmetry are broken in one direction and pairings of fermions are present in the other direction ; ( c ) a superfluid with one broken symmetry is realized in both directions ; ( d ) a band structure appears in both these phases, which explains why it is attractive to observe the supersolid crystalline phase. in this paper we deal with a more realistic system and make an ansatz for the cooper - pair ansatz, where it is the case that the order parameter is a function of the lattice wavevector @x

we have carried out a survey with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) of a sample of 16 bright lyman @xmath0 emitters around the radio galaxy 53w002, previously identified from _ wfpc2 _ images. the objects were selected primarily on the basis of their association with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and/or star - forming galaxies, with at least 2 additional agn and a starburst in a companion paper ( p98 ). here we report results for two more objects. we have also spectroscopically confirmed 16 of the 37 candidates as agn from the p98 paper into which we initially found these objects a decade ago, finding new members for both the p96ab and p98 clusters. one of the new members, object 18, is significantly more luminous and compact than the other two, object 19, with a total effective radius of 4.8 mpc and a total luminosity of over 10@xmath1 in the ionizing spectrum. based on new positional data and the undispersed ccd images from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ), which were obtained with fors2 at the anglo - australian telescope, we estimate that this structure is about 4 times brighter in flux than the brighter qso 2, and represents a surface density at the bright end of the luminosity function of the cluster which, up to now, must exceed 100 times higher than that of the fainter cluster of the same object. if we interpret this extensive line emission as tracing star formation, it implies that the cluster has grown by a factor of at least 4 over the past 100 myr, with the most luminous objects now being located within 2 mpc of the core. we do not detect extended structures anywhere near the core in our sample, which suggests that the agn there is not yet in place. extrapolating over the full range of surface brightness would require the production of anisotropic or other anisotropically - reddened material in order to match the observed continuum, but we find that the slope of the continuum does not appear to be strongly affected by anisotropy of the line emission. the absence of extended structures, even at the level of the strongest emission at the lyman limit, poses a challenge to models for the formation of clusters in the early universe.
we present the results of a detailed analysis of the _ r _ and _ f110w _ emission from the inner scattered light disk of the young main sequence star hd32297. this star is detected in the _ n__@xmath0-band with a maximum flux density @xmath1mjy. the total flux is consistent with zero interstellar extinction. in order to characterize the nature of the dust in the disk we model the scattered light and thermal emission using a chain monte carlo algorithm. we account for the stellar and disk contributions to the observed sed and deduce the disk s three - dimensional temperature, radius, and composition by assuming a mixed model. we find that the disk has a bimodal temperature distribution, with the inner disk being warmer than the outer disk and consistent with the large grains composing the disk. the temperature of the intermediate - mass grains relative to the star is too low to produce significant ice drag and poses an obstacle to the formation of an icy disk, suggesting that the grains responsible for the scattering asymmetry reside in an inner ring. the radial extent of the warm ring is not large enough to create ice drag, but the asymmetry in the scattering length could be produced by a population of smaller grains with radii too small to produce ice drag. we conclude that the narrow, asymmetric ring is unlikely to be the result of radiation pressure alone. the presence of ice and dust drag also suggests that the system is gravitationally bound and may be associated with the gould belt, though the paucity of evidence for this latter association lends support to the contention that this is a young stellar system. we show that modeling the disk emission and its surroundings with a single parameter ( temperature ) has the potential to significantly constrain the physical processes around main - sequence stars, their environments, and their physical state of evolution. however, lacking direct evidence for the age of the system, our results have significant implications for the evolutionary status of debris disks around young stars.
we report results of analysis of long - slit emission from both from the recombination lines and from the forbidden lines in the planetary nebulae ( pne ) ngc 7009, ngc 6153, and the ring nebula ngc 6720. in the case of the, we find that the and lines yield distinctly different spatial distributions in the nebula. the permitted line emission peaks closer to the central star than the forbidden line emission. this spatial distribution appears to be inconsistent with a model in which the permitted lines arise from radiative recombination of o@xmath0 in the transition zone, while the allowed lines are consistent with emission from regions that are populated by dielectronic recombination. the difference between forbidden - line and recombination - line abundances in pne is found to be inversely correlated with nebular emission measure and diameter : in compact, high - surface - brightness pne the lines of and given essentially identical abundances give essentially the same abundances, while large variations in the abundances of and lines show large abundance discrepancies. the observed discrepancy is so large that it can not be accounted for with the small - temperature fluctuation formulation of small temperature fluctuations. we have been able to reconcile the source of the discrepancy with simple thermal fluctuations ; however, such fluctuations can not solve the cause of the abundance discrepancy. in order to understand the qualitative reasons for the discrepancy, we explore several possible mechanisms. one possibility is a clumpy stellar wind from an h - poor central star, and we interpret this in terms of modest temperature fluctuations rather than the usual collisionally - excited lines. on the other hand, if the discrepancy is caused by inhomogeneities in electron temperatures, the rapid increase in recombination rates due to big increases in collisional excitation rates can not overcome the mismatch between lines and emission from the gas bubble interior, and must therefore persist over a wide range of temperatures. the possible solution to the problem is that the electron temperature is very sensitive to electron recombination rate, and thus the excitation rate is overestimated in the inner nebula, perhaps due to overestimated collisional line rates. this would need to be resolved before a viable explanation can be developed for this discrepancy.
we present observations of the optical - near - ir - far - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of two radio galaxies, 4c 41.17 ( @xmath0 ) and tn j2007@xmath11316, both at z=3.8, with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). one of the two galaxies is selected because of its relatively low level of agn activity and because its extended emission in the optical continuum and in the emission lines has been interpreted in terms of a short star - forming episode possibly initiated by gas - rich mergers. the other is selected for having a high ratio of radio to far - ir flux density, in the sense that it is seen mostly in the vicinities of its two stellar populations. using the code pgase.3 we perform the continuous optical - ir / submm spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the observer s frame which is solved by approximating the observed sed of each galaxy with a library of z=0 zero - age - main - sequence stellar populations and correcting for the effects of a small number of instrumental apertures, flux calibrations, etc. the two populations have distinct properties ( type, mass, age and star - formation history ). the presence of an old, heavily extincted stellar component, together with a young, low - luminosity component, strongly supports the view of the coexistence of the radio and starburst activity in these two galaxies. the continuum emission of the old stellar component is unpolarised and shows tell - tale absorption features indicative of on - going star formation. the only the central disk and spheroidal components are of sufficiently high surface brightness to be detectable in the deep images. in contrast, the young component is only detected in the mid - ir ( optical rest - frame ), but its spectral shape is well reproduced by a simple agn model. we discuss the implications of these results for the seds of high - redshift radio galaxies.

we present a chemical abundance analysis of a sample of 25 red giants in the globular clusters m3 and m13. the analyzed spectra, obtained with hires at the keck observatory, are of high dispersion ( r=@xmath0=35,000 ). most elements, including fe, but excluding the elements lighter than si, show no trend in abundance ratio [ x / fe ] with @xmath3, and scatter around the mean between the top of the red giant branch and near the main sequence turnoff is consistent with observational uncertainties. we find that abundances of c, n, o, and often na, mg, and al are found to be variable among red giants within a globular cluster. the correlations and anti - correlations among these light elements extend to the brightest cluster samples, where an anti - correlation between o and na is detected. this extends to the fainter clusters where the correlations are less prominent. the na - o abundance correlations do not persist over the full luminosity range of our sample. star - to - star variations of al and na, estimated from the strength of the na i absorption lines, are also detected in both clusters. m13 shows large variations in abundance of these elements at all luminosities. however, none of the light elements displays a comparable level of variation as observed in m3. this suggests that at this metallicity, non - lte effects and gravitationally induced heavy element diffusion are not important for this set of elements, at least for the range of stellar parameters we examined. our work demonstrates that if the correlations of light elements among giants are persistent and do not depend on the effective temperature of the stars, then [ fe / h ] will be low for most of the elements studied here. this would provide evidence for a difference in the chemical history and/or formation mechanisms for globular - clusters from those of the halo field stars. we also find that the neutron capture, the iron peak and the [xmath4 ] elements for most stars do not show a significant correlation with effective temperature, and that the fe i and fe ii line strengths are very similar to each other.
the noaa flare event ( 2b / x2.7 ) occurred in the noaa active region 10488, on november 3, 2003, during 01:00 ut to 02:30 ut. this event also produced a fast coronal mass ejection ( cme ). the near - sun manifestations of this event have been observed in h@xmath0, hard and soft x - rays ( rhessi and goes ), extreme ultra - violet ( soho / eit ), and radio ( hiras ). observations in the x - ray indicate that the cme associated shock propagates into the inner heliosphere to large distances from the sun, while the ips images indicate the strength of compression region between the shock and the driver gas, i.e., cme. further, the speed profile and its comparison with ips measurements made on a number of cmes, suggest an additional energy supplied by the flare / cme to the propagation. the event has been studied with a set of instruments observed a few days prior to the reported event, which cover a wide range of wavelengths and energy bands. the multi - wavelength observations provide us with important features and sequence of activities before the rising phase of the event that need more attention. the type iii bursts observed at 1000 mhz start at @xmath1, very low in the active region and intensifies further at 01:13 ut. the maximum of this type iv shows the bulging of the magnetic field system out into the corona. then this long duration event continues to decline gradually decline gradually. the soft x-ray emission measured by the goes satellite in the 0.54 and 18 wavelength bands starts to steadily increase as early as 00:30 testin, whereas the fast rise sets in around 010130 ut and increases further towards the end of the observations at about 02:01 ut. at this time, the radio emission shows a clear type iv peak and a gradual weakening of the overlying loops during the flare. we also find that there are two bands of continuum bursts that lie one over each other on the frequency scale, suggesting the presence of two radio emitting structures containing high - energy accelerated electrons. the structure of these two bands and the radio morphology of the associated cme and its associated plasma are revealed by the type ii and type iv bursts as well as by the structure embedded within them. in the time interval of 01:26 to 01:29 ut, we find evidence for the expansion of the loops to a
we study the dynamics of a system of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions for a one - dimensional nonlinear wave equation whose energy spectrum is described by the langevin stochastic partial differential equation in. we find that the time evolution of the system is either ergodic or rapidly mixing with respect to the conserving canonical invariant measure, and we support this result by computing the mean time of transition between two localized regions of the phase - space of solutions. by revisiting transition state theory, we compute the mean frequency at which the solutions cross a dividing surface separating the two minimizers of the hamiltonian. we also compute the residency time averaged over all trajectories, and show that it is possible for the system to spend a long time in a localized basins associated with the energy minima in the energy spectrum before making a transition to another such basin. these results can be extended to infinite - dimensional systems, e.g., to which they also apply, if the energy landscape possesses several local minima separated by barriers much higher than the available thermal energy. * mean transition times and ergodicity of a finite - dimensional system * + dimitri komatitsch@xmath0, zhinan xie@xcite, ebru bozovic - jelisavtsev @xmath1 + _ 1. universit de toulouse ; ups, insa, ut1, utm ; + institut fr physik und astrophysik, universitt ausgburg, d-86135 augsburg, germany _ + 2. the mitchell - viehhauser - strada institute for theoretical physics, + strada costiera 11, 34100 trieste, italy _ 3. laboratoire de physique thorique ( umr 8627 ), + btimento di fisica, universit piazza della calabria, + p.le aldo moro 5, 5, i-20133 paterna ( valencia, spain ) _ + email : pierre.degond@gmail.com + _ _ 4. department of physics and astronomy, university of pittsburgh, pa 15260, + u.s.a. _ 5. institute for advanced study, university park, pa 16802, usa _
we summarize the scientific results obtained since the iue launch in 2000 of a multiwavelength program of optical and x - ray observations of blazars, in particular for the identification of their central objects pks 2155 - 304 and 3c 279. the duration of the program, the number of observations and the quality of the data have allowed us to make substantial progress in our understanding of the blazar phenomenon. the broad band spectral flux distributions of the selected sources show most clearly the presence of a dominant radio core, flat radio spectrum ( @xmath0 ), strong radio and/or optical polarization, and rapid variability at all frequencies from the ir to the uv band. the radio to optical continuum is likely to be produced by synchrotron radiation of high energy particles in a relativistic jet, which is oriented at small angle to the line of sight. the low inclination of the primary star, and the absence of strong emission lines, point to an optically thin, optically thick accretion disk. we describe the general properties of the emission from the bl lac objects, including the variations in the strength and shape of the continuum, and of the spectral slope. the availability of simultaneous uv, optical and near - ir data, combined with previous iue observations of cyg x-1, lmc x-3 and others, allow us to estimate the importance of the inverse compton mechanism in the work of these objects. in fact, this is the first time that the effects of dust, probably from the stellar host galaxy, have been investigated in a systematic way in a blazar. the results of the current study of pks 222121414, a prototype of hmxrb, are discussed. in connection with the ongoing work of the international xfel group, we emphasize the role played by the united states of america in this growing field, through its participation in the international anti - neutrino network, through the sharing of scarce public archives of pulsars ( for a review see treves et al. 1997 ). we discuss the role of the constant pulsar activity in these sources, and in particular the positive and negative pressure on the central black hole energies due to reprocessed / re - processed x - rays and the consequent decrease of the black hole mass in the mass accretion rate onto the central object.

we present an analysis of the optical @xmath0 and hi vla observations of the sb(r ) galaxy ngc 3367. the optical observations reveal a strong and variable bar in the optical continuum in addition to a set of low surface brightness features in the h@xmath1 fabry - perot emission. a surface photometry analysis and a coupled oned-2d bulge / disk / bar decomposition process indicate that both the bulge and disk are consistent with a double exponential luminosity distribution in all the observed bands with rather small b / d luminosity ratios suggesting a possible light - to - mass ratio favoring a pseudobulge origin for the optical and nir asymmetries. we argue that the hi asymmetry may be indicative of a recent accretion event and that the concentration - asymmetry - clumpiness parameter in the disk is probably the result of a few million year long gas perturbation. the large hi mass surface density and the lack of hi gas allow us to constrain the gas kinematics to be one and the same gyr. we find evidence for a lopsided morphology in the vla images with an asymmetric vla moment 0 profile and a moderately high vla asymmetry in the outer parts of the spectrum. the nir and optical data also hint about a possible tidal origin. however, the interpretation of these features is complicated by the presence of a strong bar and the requirement of a relatively slow bar pattern speed. we also discuss the origin of the asymmetric structure and the various estimators for the bar strength, finding no convincing evidence for extraplanar gas in the dataset. we conclude that the large gas concentration in the central regions is likely to be related to the mass of the present disk rather than to the dynamical history of the bar. we discuss possible explanations for the formation of the galaxy including ( i ) an anomalously strong bar, ( ii ) a short gas relaxation time and ( gyr scale ), ( iii ) secular evolution, ( iv ) gas accretion and its connection to the agn activity, and ( v ) the presence in a past event.
we report three - dimensional numerical experiments designed to investigate the complex magnetohydrodynamics of the solar convection zone in spherical geometries. we extend our already well - tested hydrodynamic ash code ( anelastic spherical harmonic ; see clune et al. 1999, 2000, brun & reynolds 2002 ) to include the magnetic induction equation and the feedback of the field on the flow via lorentz forces and ohmic heating. the 3d simulations are resolved using the massively - parallel computing architectures of gilman & miller ( 1981 ) and glatzmaier ( 1984 ). our main goals are to study the dynamo action that is generated within the bulk of the convective zone by global - scale turbulent convection and differential rotation of the sun. we investigate the inclusion of a small seed magnetic field into existing hydrodynamical simulations in order to begin to study their structure and evolution. we find that the mean ( axisymmetric ) field components can be much more influenced by the presence of the seed than by the effects of convective motions in the planetary interiors. the resulting fields have a much more regular distribution of amplitudes and fluxes than the analogues observed in the earth s magnetosphere. these properties are particularly interesting in the progenitor simulation in which the solar surface magnetic energy is about 7 % of the total magnetic energy, although the net effect on the field is essentially the same. hanferts and simple dynamo models are used to characterize the high - energy, low - density solutions of the simulation. these solutions possess a mixed mix of kinetic and dispersive energy components and appear to be somewhat more orderly and less chaotic than the low - energy solutions. in addition, these simulations exhibit significant dynamo back - reaction, which is enabled by the stably - stratified shear conditions of our simulations. they also show a remarkable ability to produce surface magnetic fields in very rough alignment with the photosphere rotation axis.
the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond is a sensitive probe of magnetic fields at the nano - scale. however, it is difficult to distinguish individual nuclear spins embedded in a dense sample. furthermore, cross polarization is plagued by imperfect energy matching, which broadens the effective frequency resolution. to increase the frequency resolution and thus spatial resolution, we exploit the presence of an ancillary qubit associated with the nitrogen nuclear spin ( @xmath0 ). this qubit can store information about the state of the nv electronic spin, while the external nuclear spins evolve under the action of a magnetic field gradient. we thus obtain a 2d, correlated spectrum, forming an over - constrained system for the spin positions. the sequence is compatible with homonuclear decoupling, thus allowing sensing beyond the natural bio - molecule nmr linewidth. by using the polarized nuclear spins as probes of their own environment, this protocol can thus overcome the phase problem that plagues other experimental techniques. since the early days of quantum imaging, diamond has been used to produce, control and measure atomic - scale resolution. more recently, biomolecular imaging techniques have been extended to diamond, including x - ray diffraction and 2d nuclear spin spectroscopy. diamond nano - vacancy centers ( nvs ) are localized in diamond, providing information on the nature of the nuclei @xcite. the property of nvs, combined with the rapid magnetic response, makes them an ideal system for quantum imaging. nv centers in diamond are also the focus of many investigations, such as the determination of the local van der waals ( vdw ) molecule from photoionization of dna and catheters. in this article we explore a method for nv imaging based on the intrinsic nmr structure in diamond. our method can be applied to image protein sites in biological molecules, extending the sensing range of our previous atom - wave sensing technique.
we investigate dynamo action in a solar - type star rotating three times faster than the sun. we find that strong dynamo actions occur in the bulk of the convection zone and that the magnetic fields are organized on global scales into large wreaths. these wreath have opposite polarity in each hemisphere. they are not isolated flux surfaces and instead are intricately linked across the equator and to the polar regions. the speedup bands observed in that simulation are achieved by the dynamo. we analyze the mechanisms by which the global - scale fields are maintained and destroyed in this dynamo and find that the toroidal fields are built primarily by the @xmath0-effect, where differential rotation stretches theglobal - scale poloidal field into a mean toroidal field. during a reversal, the magnetic wellhs near the equators propagate towards the poles and are replaced by new wewhs with opposite polaria. reversals occur in both the _ polar_- and _ equatorial _ regions of the solar system. the polarity reversal in the stellar convection shell occurs irregularly, with the average reversal times being 1000 - 1500 days. we suggest that the poleward slip instability, associated with the equatorial motion of magnetic structures, is the mechanism responsible for this cross - over. we conclude that the rapid cyclic rotation of this star is generating strong magnetic fields and will probably be important in generating the cyclic flux in the future.

we present the results of a deep, multiwavelength investigation of the far - infrared ( fir ) emission from the intergalactic star formation region ( sq ) of the spiral galaxy group ngc 7319, based on spitzer space telescope observations obtained with the iram plateau de bure interferometer and the galex satellite. by fitting isocam with dust emission templates, we have derived the angular sizes and column densities of the various gas components seen in the group, including the star forming regions and the tidal features, and we have compared the residual fir emission ( the residual soft x - ray emission after the subtraction of galaxies and discrete star formation regions ), the residual which is attributed to the ashes of the intracluster medium ( igm ), with the star formation occurring in sq superimposed on the main stellar disk. we find that the total star formation rate, within a circular area of radius @xmath0, measured on the maps of the four constituent galaxies and the surrounding group in terms of their uv luminosities, is essentially independent of whether the gas is located in the galaxy disk or in the igm. although this apparent shift in the pattern of star formation from the main disk of the group to the outskirts of the galaxies might be caused by tidal debris, it seems more likely that it is caused by inelastic gas - grain collisions, most of which are likely to occur in the shock region and not in the interior of the galaxy disks. we have measured the gas masses of the observed dust emitting sources, the observed hi and co line intensities and the fraction of dust which has been converted into stars, using the infrared sed fitting technique. the total dust infrared luminosity derived from these measurements is 0.6@xmath1, or 20 times higher than the value derived from the radio infrared relation derived by @xcite, consistent with previous measurements of the dust to gas ratio in nearby spiral galaxies. from this set of measurements, together with simple predictions for the gas cooling time scale and the amount of dust injection in hot plasma, we conclude that collisional heating plays a role in determing the growth of sq star formation. we do not find any convincing evidence for the enhanced star formation which is likely to be due to hysteretic heating rather than cold gas heating, possibly due to enhanced radiative heating in the shocked plasma. finally, we find the gas mass of sq to be consistent with the local galaxy hii regions, although we can not rule out the
we present new, high signal - to - noise echelle spectra of the red - giant - branch ( rgb ) giants m 3 ( ngc 5272 ) and m 13 (= ngc 6205 ) obtained with the mayall 4-meter telescope on kitt peak. these spectra are used to determine abundances in the iron - peak elements sodium, helium and aluminum and to examine the hypothesis that deep mixing along the rgb causes enhancements of these elements and changes in the rgb morphology. the data show the usual trends in the proton - capture, @xmath0ne and fe - peak iron abundances. however, we find that the abundances of aluminum and sodium exhibit an increasing trend with [ al / fe ] that is consistent with deep mixing and, for the first time, with the hypothesized ` ` blue - tail second parameter '' ( btp ) that is suggested by briley et al. ( 1994 ). our data are also consistent with primordial enrichment by intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch stars. using the al ratio as a diagnostic of the deep mixing rate, we determine that the inferred hydrogen - burning shell ( hb ) morphology can not be a reliable measure of the al abundance since the correlation between the al and the hb ratio is not the same for the m 3 giants and the m 13 giants. in m 13, the data are less well described by a two - parameter approach and we suggest that a third parameter, which we define as the ratio of blue to red hb stars, should be used as a local analog of the color - magnitude relation. the abundance pattern of the helium that is formed inside the rgb due to deep mixing is found to be bimodal, which is contrary to previous suggestions that it might create an extended blue tail ( seen in some metal - poor clusters ). the neutron - capture elements sodium and aluminum are enhanced by approximately 0.3 dex and the iron peak elements remain constant in abundance. these trends are consistent with the predictions of a scenario in which deep mixing on the rgb produces enhancements in the latter cluster and/or in m 3. we examine the possibility that there is a ` ` primordial '' origin of the variations in the chemical abundances and find that this is unlikely, given the likely low ages of the metal - rich clusters that have the, on average, same metallicity and lack of abundance anomalies. deep mixing, primordial chemistry, stars : abundances stars : agb and post - agb stars
we discuss optical and radio properties of 30,000 first sources positionally matched within 1.5 arcsec of an sdss source in 1230 deg@xmath0 of sky. the matched sample represents 30 % of the 108,000 optical first sources detected by the first survey and 0.1 % of all @xmath1 sdss sources in the studied region. sdss spectra are available for 4,300 galaxies and 1154 quasars from this matched sample. we show that the selection efficiency can be increased by combining sdss and first data. the spectral types and optical colors of the matched and unmatched sources are very similar. we find that the optical - to - radio flux ratio, radio - loudness ratio, and radio - quiet quasar fraction are all consistent with that of bright extragalactic radio sources, and lower limits are found for the quasar - quiet fraction ( 5 % ). we identify radio galaxies with optical spectroscopic redshifts ( typical of sdss - type objects ) ranging from 0.3 to 1.6, and red optical spectra for 2.5 magnitudes. the optical luminosity function of radio galaxies is found to be similar to that of all galaxies with the same color, despite being 1 magnitude brighter than other galaxies in flux - limited samples. we analyze optical versus.optical properties of radio sources using multicolor catalogs ( where morphological types are well separated, e.g., c.m., richardson _ et al._2000 ) and examine the distribution of emission line ratios indicative of agn rather than starburst emission, finding that the incidence of merging galaxies and galaxies with disturbed structure is higher among the blue radio galaxies than that of the red radio galaxies. we demonstrate that the integrated optical emission line strengths of galaxies with strong star formation can be used to separate sources with agn emission from galaxies with weak or no emission lines in their spectra. a control sample of 20,085 spectroscopically confirmed sdss objects with sdss colors indistinguishable from those of stars, and qsos from the sdss quasar survey ( the only survey with optical identifications ) is used to estimate the fraction of qsas missing from the sample, where appropriate data are available only for a subset of 1,154 objects in the controlled redshift range discussed in this work. the results are discussed in the context of the large area first and sdss radio surveys. # 1to 0pt#1 # 1 #
we present a sample of selected galaxies that have been selected solely on the strength of an absorption line from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). this sample of galaxies exhibits a diversity in both the morphologies and stellar populations, and it contains some of the sub classes of galaxies discussed in the literature, such as ` ` e+a '', k+a, and h@xmath0strong galaxies. to avoid confusion with other authors, we simply call this sample ` ` selected '' ( hds ) galaxies. in this paper, we present the details of our selection criteria and leave the investigation and interpretation of these galaxies to subsequent papers. we examine the frequency of emission lines (,, ) in the spectra of our sample of hds galaxies. using the measured equivalent width ( ew ) of the absorption line, we compare our measurements of the ew of this line against that of spectro1d for all sdss spectra regardless of their emission line strengths. we find that only @xmath1 % of our hds sample satisfies the strict criteria of ew ( ) / oii ) = @xcite, oii + \delta ew([oii ] ) + \geq0}$]to be strong, which indicates the presence of on going star formation activity, yet the non - detection of indicates that the galaxy has under gone a recent transformation in its star formation history. we compare the properties of our samples of galaxies with those of a shallower sample of high redshift galaxies, namely the 2dfgrs and the sdss luminosity function, as well as with higher redshift studies of such galaxies. although our sample is not complete in any sense, our findings provide a benchmark for the community to use these data to help the community construct a larger sample of strong galaxies, thus aiding in the interpretation of existing and future strong galaxy samples, _ e.g. _, the agn plus post starburst galaxy sample, and the sample of lrg galaxies and quasars.
we present detailed analyses of stellar elemental abundance ratios for 81 dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster and 66 more luminous galaxies of the shapley supercluster, based on high - resolution spectroscopy from aaomega and hectospec. the data probe a very wide range of velocity dispersions ( @xmath0 ), luminosities and metallicities, allowing us to examine the correlations between the abundance ratios and the luminosity, velocity dispersion, age and metallicity of the galaxies. single - parameter fits to the full dataset reveal that the abundance ratio correlations of mg, ca, c, n and o are strongly anti - correlated with age, in agreement with previous studies. by co - adding the data for all four light elements, we find that the _ x - plane _ behaviour of mg / fe is also consistent with an anti - correlation with fe / h, but with a different slope for ca and n. the x - planes for the c and n abundances are flatter than for fe, despite the fact that the c / fe ratios show a similar trend with luminosity. this is in line with previous simulations, which also predict a higher zero - point for n / fe. for the metal - poor galaxies in our sample, the anti - correlations for mg and ca relative to fe become much more prominent at low fe, while for the more metal - rich galaxies they are offset from this trend. the multi - parameter fit to the data confirms that the dominant dependence for ca / fe on luminosity is a _ delay _ in releasing fe - rich ejecta from type ia supernovae ( snia ), which is probably produced in less massive stars. the stellar population ages of our galaxy are consistent with a progenitor mass function which varies as a function of galaxy mass, modifying the relative number of snia and snii stars in each galaxy, but not their abundance ratios. we discuss these results in the context of chemical evolution models for unresolved galaxies, and conclude that they can not be produced by ` ` ` hidden '' variations in the time - scale of star formation in high - mass galaxies.

an ansatz for the @xmath0-point one - loop scattering amplitudes of gravitons and of gluons is presented. we show that the relevant amplitudes for yang - mills theory ( sdg ) are the only ones with identical helicity. the ansatz is constructed by using the exact solutions of the full sdg field equations, up to a factor of two higher than the current numerical estimates. we also compute the tree - level amplitudes and show that they obey a squaring relation similar to that derived by kawai, lewellen and tye for four - point amplitudes in string theory. we have examined the form of the gravitational ansatz and the factorization properties as to motivate it. # 1_#1 _ = 0.1 cm = -2.5 cm = 23.2truecm = 16.7truecm 40 pt plus 1000pt minus 100pt # 1 # 1= to [ section ] # 1eq.

we investigate the impact of population iii ( pop iii ) stars in the formation and subsequent star formation process of the first galaxies. using a suite of cosmological radiation - hydrodynamical simulations, we specifically focus on the population iii progenitors and their environments and the conditions under which a second star formation event can take place. we find that once the first stars have formed, their gas is already highly ionized and was photoionized to a few @xmath0k. as a consequence, if a pop iii star ended its life as a black hole ( bh ), subsequent gas accretion onto the remnant may have resulted in a miniquasar a stellar mass black hole accreting near the eddington limit that emitted x - rays. we also find that metal - poor halo stars, expected to form out of gas enriched by pop iii stars, have so far not exhibited the strong elemental odd - even effect and the absence of any neutron - capture elements, which would be manifest signatures for pisne. we propose a subgrid prescription for chemical diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient must somehow reflect the amplitude of the local turbulent cascade. from the diffuse gas in the halo, we construct a cluster of pop ii stars, which is able to form pop ii black holes via direct collapse, even if their masses are a factor of a few smaller than pop iii masses. in this scenario, some of the metal - enriched gas is ejected from the cluster and is used to enrich the next generation of stellar systems. the resulting stellar mass function is expected to have changed from the top - heavy imf predicted for pop iii to the low - mass dominated imf of population ii. finally, we discuss the implications of the assembly process for the dynamical evolution of pop iii remnants and their subsequent re - formation in galaxies.

we study the formation of singularities in the gravitational collapse of a cloud, when the dust component is taken to be non - zero. contrary to the dust collapse models with @xmath0, there may be a bounce for both positive and negative values of the cosmological constant. this is due to the contribution from the tangential pressure. we show that the bounce of the complete cloud undergoes a non - vanishing energy transition as the final end state of gravitational collapse. the different treatment we have used to deal with the pressure evolution within the collapsing clouds, arrives at the same conclusion when the gravity forces are re - imposed. we also rederive the previously studied case when the pressure is vanishing. in that case, although the singularity may be locally visible, the final possible outcome is obscured by the cosmic censorship conjecture, i.e., the existence of a region of non - nowhere at the horizon, where the final horizon formation takes place. black hole formation, singularities, cosmic censorship the discovery of black holes by a gravitational wave, is one of the most significant unsolved problems in physics today. one would like to understand how the strong gravitational field of a black hole propagates down to the non - linear scale and eventually merge with the other black holes and make the black hole appear as a bright bright object, in such a way that the entire universe would be seen as one large spinning black hole. of late, there has been a great interest in the possibility that the singularities we study may ultimately be of observational origin. the idea would be to use the perceived singularity to probe the nature of the collapse event horizon, to see if it is possible to see the future event horizons in the presence of a gravitational field. of course this is a hard question to be answered, and one has to hope that there is a loophole or loophole in the behavior of the present experiment.
the phase behavior of two - dimensional ( 2d ) wetting mixtures is investigated by means of coupled self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations and monte carlo simulations. we focus on the interplay between wetting and miscibility : the critical point occurs close to the bulk critical point, and converges towards it in the limit of infinite film thickness ( for @xmath0 ) while the critical points in antisymmetric films are associated with the wetting transition. the scf calculations provide an accurate description for many properties except for the ultimate vicinity of critical points. the spatial extension of the molecules also sets the length scale of enrichment layers. since the pioneering paper by parry and co - workers ( phys. rev. lett. * 84 *, 3946 ( 2000 ) ), the behavior of polymer mixtures in traps has been a subject of intense research at the frontiers of polymer science. such behavior is attributed to the fact that a thin film does not exhibit a free energy barrier between the minimum and the surface and the behavior at large distances, i.e. at the interface. if the surface interaction is comparable to the liquid / vapor tension, however, the liquid phase is decoupled from the vapor phase and appears in the form of a 2d unmixing transition. in the following we consider a binary polymer blend. we find that in the vicinity of the tricritical point there are 2d ising - like phases whose transitions are of first order. we also find evidence that the interface localization / delocalization transition in an asymmetric double wedge occurs in first order, and we infer the critical exponent. the results of the simulations are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. besides, the characterization of the phase behavior at critical points has recently received increasing attention. see, e.g., ref.. and references therein. the 2d behavior of photoluminescence mixtures has attracted substantial attention from both theorists and experimentalists alike. in contrast to the three dimensional ( 3d ) ising behavior in the films, where the thermo - chemistry is dominated by the thermodynamic effect of evaporation, in the regions around critical points the structure function and phase behavior are rather independent of the model.
the asymptote of a perturbation of a black hole is investigated in the framework of a gauge - invariant formalism for gravitational perturbations of maximally symmetric static homogeneous space - times. it turns out that the field equations can be written in terms of an integral transformation, and that the behavior of the perturbed field can be understood through a symmetry analysis of the background space - time. a possible reason for the existence of a finite number of fields is that our black hole encounters a mass - less field far from the horizon. we show analytically that near the horizon there exists a linear solution which behaves similarly to the non - linear solution. after substitution, the linear solution is reduced to a second order ordinary differential equation in the radial direction. from this solution we obtain a set of non - vanishing scalar and vector fields. interestingly, these fields are those for which the linear reduction is not possible. in the second half of the paper we discuss the status of our analysis, focussing on the recent results of kashiwagi and kobayashi. we also present some developments of our formalism, extending it to higher dimensions. the results are expected to have useful applications in particle physics and in string theory. = 1=1=1 by 1.25 in.25 in = 1.5 in # 1to 0pt#1 * * + + _ @xmath0 inst. of theoretical physics _ * # 1 * ( 19#2 ) # 1#2#3_phys. rev. _ * d#1*(5 ) # 2#1#20. # 1_j. high energy * * & * b * * d^ * * u * * g : * + _ # 1*d#1 # 1(g ) _ epsf.tex :.99 in
we discuss the emission processes during the giant flare of the tev blazar mkn 501 in the april 1997 outburst in the context of a modified synchrotron proton blazar model. we use an exact monte - carlo code to simulate particle production and cascade development, and this allows us to use exact cross sections for the first time in a model based on direct proton - proton interactions in a non - relativistic kolmogorov shock. as an example, we model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the event. we assume that the major emission processes in the model are photon production by energetic protons ( @xmath0-decay ) and subsequent photon - photon cascade, and that the injected radiation field is controlled by the magnetic field. we take into account the subsequent radiation field produced by the bremsstrahlung emission due to interactions of protons with the ambient thermal plasma, and the subsequent creation of high energy neutrinos as a result of pion photoproduction. in particular, we consider a model in which the neutrino spectrum is dominated by a gamma - ray dominated component. this model could explain the energy flux variability observed by egret in the x - rays and tev gamma rays up to 20 tev. the model predicts a power - law spectrum with a photon index ranging from 0.034 in the 0.2 to 1.8 tev bands, and a gradual steepening up to 24 tev, in agreement with current observations. upper limits on the maximum achievable particle energy from this model are discussed. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) = cmr10 = cmbx10 scaled1 = cmti10 scaled 1 = cmrn10 scaled 8 = cmn8 = cmtt8 = cmmi7 = cmsy7 = crmr7 = cmbsy5 = cmtsy5 psfig.sty [ firstpage ] gamma - rays : bursts - ism : jets and outflows - radiation mechanisms : non - thermal - bl lacertae objects : general - gamma rays : observations
we present a spectral analysis of the entire sample of cataclysmic variable ( cv ) systems detected by _ integral_. eleven systems have been observed by _ swift_/xrt, four by _ ibis _ /xrt and one by _ xmm - newton _ / gk per. we cross - correlate the bremsstrahlung emission ( @xmath0 kev ) and the 20100 kev flux, making use of both _ integral _ and ibis data. this allows us to investigate the spectral complexity of the emission, in particular the presence of a boundary layer between the accretion disk and the wd surface. we confirm a temperature for the hard x - ray emission at around 25 kev, without claiming an emission reflection component, as reported by de martino et al. for magnetic cvs. this temperature is quite close to the temperatures of the post - shock region in polar cvs, suggesting that the emission does not come from a converging stream. concerning the temperature of the soft gamma - ray component, we find that it too radiates at an extremely low energy, as found by others. however, this emission is much less powerful than in the polars, implying that these polars are not strong emitters above 10 kev. this result seems to be consistent with previous indications that the high energy spectra of the most powerful hard x- ray emitters are not dominated by cyclotron emission but by blackbody emission. furthermore, we confirm that the non detection of a blackbody component in some of these systems is likely to be related to the lack of radial accretion flow. we find no significant correlations between the spectral parameters of the source and the degree of synchronisation of the white dwarf.

we present a detailed analysis of the x - ray variability characteristics of ngc 7469, based on an @xmath0d, densely - sampled rxte observation. the power density spectrum ( psd ) shows no low frequency turnover or high frequency break. the cross - correlations show a strong peak at zero lag, but are asymmetric towards the side where the hard x - rays lag. the psd is much flatter than the 2 - 4 and 4 - 10 kev psd, which suggests that the uv seed photons are upscattering the soft spectrum. in addition, there are very rapid variations in the x- ray spectrum which occur faster than changes in the supposed seed photons. we suggest that this burst of rapid variability has something to do with the process which heats the corona. we calculate the amplitude of the variability on time scales of less than one day and conclude that the rapid variations are most likely due to heating in the extended chromosphere. the most puzzling aspect of our analysis is that the soft variations follow those in the hard. this leads one to suppose that the variability is due to a gradient in the coronal temperature, which is not well - constrained by the data. the ratio of the soft to hard flux is very similar to that found by narayan & eaves in another source, i.e. 15@xmath1. this lends support to the scenario in which the soft variability precede those at harder energies by a lag. we also confirm the previous finding by bringer et al. that the cross correlation is not due to light travel time effects, but due to an intrinsic error in the spectral index. this error is the strongest constraint on the spectral model, and we argue that it is the cause of the steep psd. the spectral variations are consistent with an extremely broad temperature gradient, varying by more than two orders of magnitude in a few hours, during the course of a day. this requires a very large corona, covering at most one percent of the sky. the implications of this for models of the emission from agn are also discussed.
we investigate the recent star formation history of the milky way disk by using data from the open cluster database. our analysis covers the last 0.2 gyr in the age range 0.6 - 2.0 gyr. the mean age is about 22 % and the trend suggests that younger ages are affected by larger errors. a uniform rate of cluster formation and an exponentially declining dissolution rate would have produced a single population of clusters that would follow a straight line in a logarithmic plot with a slope given by the characteristic life - time of the population. evidence for at least five epochs of enhanced star formation during the time interval studied has been found. the obtained star formation rate is consistent with other rates deduced using a range of age indicators, metallicities, and _ hipparcos _ parallaxes. interpreting the age distribution diagram suggests that quiescent star formation has proceeded in discrete, highly - correlated regions of activity producing clusters which dissipate their parent molecular cloud on a time - scale of a few myr ( @xmath0-body models ). the majority of open clusters formed during the non - enhanced ( enhanced ) star formation periods are destroyed and their members become field stars on a relatively long time interval ; however, there appears to be a long - lasting component as well. our results indicate that the exploited age data can be used to construct age and star formation histories for the solar neighbourhood and the galactic disk. specific bursts of star formation, associated with associated dynamical events in the disks, may trigger significant star formation in the local universe. the possibility that these bursts are triggered by small - scale supernova explosions or by the passage of a large number of stellar clusters through the galactic magnetic field is discussed. some studies have suggested that a small number of bursts ( about 5 per cent ) operate concurrently with the larger number of normal star formation events. we explore the possibility of this scenario by exploring the number of supernova remnants produced in the past. we find some evidence that the bursts may be triggered by external perturbations, possibly from the magellanic clouds and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. we also find that some of the older open clusters can not be younger than the newly formed clusters. the wide range of ages in the studied region of sky allows us to determine the trail left by the parent galaxy.
i outline the work done in identifying star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 through the identification of lyman break ` ` drop - outs '' in the first billion years of the universe through deep imaging in the optical and near - infrared with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and spectroscopy with large telescopes from the ground. i outline the success in identifying such galaxies through the use of a strong spectral break, arising from absorption by neutral hydrogen in intervening clouds along the line of sight ( the lyman-@xmath2 forest ). i discuss the impact of this spectral break on our ability to identify galaxies at high redshifts, and the techniques for finding them, including the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging. the acs imaging is particularly sensitive to star - bright knots of uv - bright, late - type star formation within large galaxies at low redshift which can be probed with upcoming deep imaging surveys like the goodsv0.5 and goodsv1.5 surveys. in this review i will outline the successes and limitations of this technique, and describe the challenges involved in its use, and discuss the approaches that have been used to detect and identify such high - redshift galaxies. i will also discuss the stellar masses and formation epochs of these galaxies, and what role they may have played in reionization. i suggest that the early universe was dominated by a population of massive, early - type galaxies which were reionized by hot, massive star formation rather than by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ; these star forming galaxies might have played a crucial role in the formation of the present - day universe. there is evidence from the best - fit star formation rates and stellar mass functions at the time of the big bang that star formation was concentrated in a few hundred million years old. the early formation of these massive galaxies was likely dominated by mergers of already - formed stars with already - existing hierarchical merging histories, so that there is no need to invoke mergers to reionize the universe at these early epochs.
the problem of the luminosity calibration of type - ia supernovae ( sneia ) in m101 was analyzed from the point of view of the true distance modulus of the galaxy, @xmath0, using cepheid and trgb moduli. the authors have found that the apparent magnitude of the transient palomar iron giant branch ( trgb ) of m101 in the russian dwarf spheroidal galaxy ngc101 exceeds by one magnitude the mean absolute magnitude and is compatible with a recent trgb determination by luengo, melle - hernndez, and collaborators. we confirm the validity of the trgb method used by the authors for the case of the pure type ia sn2011fe. we give the corrected absolute magnitudes for the remaining four sneia with suggested trgb distances, all of which are bona fide members of the leo i group. the effect of the inclusion of the newly discovered faint object sn1972e in the analysis is shown to be negligible. we reconsider the question of the light curves of sneia from a sample of 62 sneia in inner m101, using published values from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) supernova catalog and from the digital sky survey data release 5 ( _ sdss _, vol. 7 ). for m101 a large - scale correlation between the trgbs of ngc3368 and ngc3627 and 3368 is found, as well as a faint point source in the literature, ngc4038. the significance of these two galaxies for the m101 trgb problem is discussed. they lie close to the region of the hubble deep in a field of the virgo cluster with the faint, red clump of a known as a subgiant. the field containing the bright, young, massive, metal - poor stars is explained in terms of the ( too ) bright and luminous stars of a younger population. a carefully chosen selection of field galaxies with well - defined light curves, corrected for both galactic and internal absorption, and with accurate photometry, gives a local value for the cepheids of @xcite. this value is in excellent agreement with the one derived from the ( *??? * model lrg ) distance to m101 based on observations with the utrecht echelle spectrograph. the difference is accounted for by the use of a different selection rule for the faint object, from the survey data of the red
we present results from large @xmath0-body / hydrodynamics simulations of the cosmological evolution of clusters of galaxies, combining radiative cooling and energy feedback from galaxies with the star formation and dynamical activity of the cluster population. these simulations include a self - similar treatment of merging and non - merging processes, and thus allow non - gravitational physics to be incorporated self - consistently. the clef simulation is a large ( up to sixty @xfig2 kev ) @xft / sph simulation of structure formation within a comoving box, incorporating dark matter and a universe with sub - critical matter density. we find that the vast majority of clusters contain cooling cores ( _ i.e. _ strong cooling cores ) at all redshifts, but the characteristic profile of the core properties changes with redshift. regular clusters have flatter regular cluster profiles at large radii, while irregulars have enhanced entropy profiles near the centre due to the presence of a second object which compresses and heats the gas. the icm temperature profile of regular clusters has a generic shape at low and high redshift, decreasing in the centre ( due to radiative cooled radiatively cooling ) and beyond ( due primarily to the intrinsic shape of the gravitational potential ). irregular clusters have higher entropy profiles and regular clusters with strong cooling core have lower entropy profiles. the scaled entropy profile of irregular clusters is an outer logarithmic slope of 0.9 and decreases all the way into the centre, with no clear evidence of a flattened core. the ratio of the normalisation at small radii to the maximum cluster temperature is similar to that expected from the gravitational - heating model, but at higher redshift the entropy at large radius is higher. the global x - ray properties of the clusters are also in good agreement with the recent observational data of da silva et al. while the mass estimates of this sample drawn from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation are around 20 per cent lower than the true statistical density, we examine the degree of systematic bias introduced by the small number of clusters in this study. we show that, despite the bias, the entropy versus luminosity relation evolves in a similar way to that seen for star - forming clusters at low redshift both in the absence of any strong cooling - flow systems and in the positive cluster scaling relation. on the positive side, our results can be used to make predictions, as we are able to reproduce the observed scatter in the luminosity temperature relation, and derive simple scalings of the mean cluster temperature
we investigate the chemical abundances of a sample of 12 quasar - like absorption line systems with column densities in the range @xmath0 cm@xmath1, selected from the uves / vlt database. in each system we find evidence for low - ion metal absorption, intermediate - ion transitions, and/or high - ionization transitions. we construct a list of 12 sub - damped lyman limit systems ( dlas ), and one borderline case between them. this homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of each system is presented in paper ii of the series of papers by wolfe et al. ( 2002b ). in the sample of 13 systems, which span a range of redshift from 1.8 to 4.3, we detect 12 metal lines of o, c, si, n, o, ne, s, mg, al, fe, ni, zn, and cr, and 6 different ions of 11 different elements, as well as many non - c elements, e.g., silicon, titanium, calcium, iron, and zinc. in six out of the 13 systems we detect metal lines, while in the remaining six we find only weak metal lines. in four cases the metal lines are not detected at all. the _ intrinsic _ abundance measurements of o and si clearly show that in these systems the gas - phase abundances are not homogeneous. in particular, we find that o is enhanced with respect to silicon in the cases where it is detected, while zn is underabundant. this result provides insight into the origin of the co - existence of two distinct regions of neutral hydrogen in these quasar absorbers and suggests that these two regions, although not necessarily physically connected, may be physically connected. we also find that in all of the systems we find an anti - correlation between neutral hydrogen column density and zn abundance, an effect that can be used as an indirect indicator of the level of dust depletion.

we present a study of the dynamics of domain walls in the presence of an interfacial dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film of carbon nanotube co / alo@xmath0. this was possible because of the bloch mechanism and bloch / nel correspondence for the magnetostatically magnetized configuration and because of their chirality. the dmi can be applied either parallel or perpendicular to the film axis, which allows us to distinguish the two types of walls. we analysed by means of micromagnetic simulations the effects that an external magnetic field @xmath1 m has to induce in order to produce the unusual domain wall behaviour observed in the experiment. these include : ( i ) the appearance of bloch walls as lines of black / white contrast when the applied magnetic field twists and compresses the dws ; ( ii ) dark or bright contrasts at the walls when a dmi is applied ; ( iii ) the possibility of spatially symmetric annihilation of all the dw walls, even when the annihilation field is small enough so that no dark lines are present in the images ; and ( iv ) dramatic differences in the intensity and morphology of the walls as a function of the applied field. the properties of the domain walls were investigated by micromagnetically imaging methods using the laser dynamic imaging unit ( l - tem ) and high - resolution grating spectrometry@xcite. whilst the effects of anisotropy in the magnetization configuration were previously reported in thin films were observed in plasmonic systems @xcite, here we focus on thin films possessing an in - plane magnetization. the principle behind the magneto - topological order is that a magnetic field of an appropriate magnitude and direction will induce magnetization along the major loop of the film, making the film display a chiral, two - wall structure. this is due to the fact that the introduction of magnetostaticity in such systems gives rise to an energy that is impossible in uncoupled systems. moreover, since external magnetic fields are of the order of atomic sizes or nanometers, the formation of magnetic pixels is expected : when a sufficiently large magnetic field is applied, magnetic pixels will align and form a thin boundary between the two walls, giving rise to domain walls that are homochiral and mutually orthogonal. as a result, the atomic spacetime of such a material will always be asymmetric and will be associated with a charge exchange between
we calculate the spin - stiffness and the coupling constant for the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on a square lattice. the calculations are performed within the self - consistent version of spin - wave theory. we find the ground state energy to be composed of two parts. one component is a spin spiral, spontaneously directed along the ( 1,0 ) or ( 0,1 ) direction ; the other is a static or dynamic spin spiral. the anisotropy depends on the lattice deformation. at small anisotropies, the spiral energy is monotonic, its ground state is just a constant and it does not change its sign at the transition to the haldane phase. series expansions of the characteristic exponents are presented. the obtained results are in qualitative agreement with experimental data. since the discovery of the berry phase in high temperature superconductivity @xcite, a lot of work has been done to understand the mechanism of underdoped cuprates. theoretically, the non - equilibrium evolution of the cuprates is well understood, as evidenced in the well - known landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski equation@xcite. experimentally, different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the anomalous behavior of the temperature - dependent spin stiffness. the mean - field description has been proposed in terms of a nonlinear sigma equation, so the variance is proportional to the difference between the values of the bulk elastic modulus and the ratio of the neutron scattering amplitudes. according to this model, the increase of the density of pairs of holes is accompanied by an decrease of the pressure. more recently, the same mechanism has been suggested in the context of superconductors as a mechanism for the observation of quantum fluctuations in the electronic band structure of cuprates and other crystalline materials @xcire. even in the 1d limit, the degeneracy of the molecular orbitals can be broken by the introduction of magnetic impurities. on the other hand, a number of experiments have suggested a tunneling of the quasiparticles into the system, inducing a local superconducting state. in this work we extend the calculations for spin - half cuprates to the case of identical but anisotropic exchange couplings. this new model will provide us with a wealth of information about the microscopic origin of the phase transition.
we show that the problem of finding the optimal linear machine for quantum information classification ( e&d ) on a data qubit of size @xmath0 is still open, assuming that the stern - gerlach measure plays the role of the optimal discriminator. we prove that the performance of the lm is not altered by these effects, in particular, in the asymptotic limit of large ts. in contrast to the pure state case where there is a single contribution corresponding to the maximum in ( [ omega_m ] ), it then follows that mixed - state quantum classification using a scale of the ts ( measurement of the information content, not the state ) is equivalent to its _ pure_-state version for a ts that is partitioned by positive partial transposition. thus, optimal lm discrimination, as claimed in @xcite, is achieved by a local operator valued measure on the ts, whose outcome is fed - forward to a second povm depending on the stimulus. we use this to derive the error probability, or equivalently, the excess risk, of a lm for small samples ( approximately those for which the exact s / n is known ), assuming strictly that the noise amplitude of the measurement is small. + pacs number(s ) : 05.10.-a, 05.45.df, 89.75.gk + * keywords : * quantum information processing, optimal machines, semidefinite programming * an important development in the theory of quantum mechanics is the discovery of intrinsically non - trivial quantum states, which can not be simulated by any classical computer. this first step of quantum computing has been taken with the introduction of quantum bits, which are quantum memories and which are robust against random adiabatic fluctuations in the number of states of each system. remarkably, quantum mechanics provides us with a tool to extract the relevant information from corrupted quantum information. after this initial step, practical implementations of quantum computers have steadily been developed, leading, for example, to techniques of quantum computation based on local operations on quantum memories. this is quite a challenging task in view of the fact that a vast amount of information has to be extracted from quantum registers, even in the case where the machines are actually quantum computers. a possible solution to this problem is to approximate the quantum computers with classical registers, so that the information initially stored in the quantum register can easily be retrievable in the classical memory. an example of such a quantum machine has been proposed by seidelin _ et al. _ @xc
we present near - infrared spectra of the gravitationally - lensed seyfert-2 galaxy fsc 10214 + 4724 obtained with the cgs4 spectrometer on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) at @xmath0 in order to study the properties of the inner narrow - line region ( inlr ) and the nuclear region. the lensing of this object by a compact lensing system with a scale radius of about half the size of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) allows us to resolve several of the remaining puzzles relating to this object. we discuss the appearance of the apparent presence of a ly@xmath1 emission line, the weakness of the balmer lines, the low ionisation lines and the lack of [ oii]372.7 in the spectrum. we also present the results of photoionisation modelling which points to the likely origin of the narrow line emission in the inlr. the strong suppression of the hydrogen lines, as originally predicted by soifer et al. ( 1995 ), in the absence of any broad - line component, is remarkable. this is consistent with models in which the highly - ionised ` ` warm absorbers'seen in the high - redshift universe ( i.e. a few solar masses of gas mass per year ) are hidden by dust, and therefore missed from uv - based estimates. even at 10 pc from the agn, we do not, however, find the extremely high star formation rates ( several times the rates implied by the emission line luminosity, if a large fraction of the emission is due to a starburst. consequently, we suggest that the starburst is occuring very close in to the nucleus, possibly in the obscuring torus. from optical depth arguments we have been able to calculate the relative contributions of a narrow column of material associated with star formation, the backside of which may be partially obscured from our line of sight by the dusty torus, thus producing lines of sight which are anomalously weak in the overall weak balmer line spectrum. # 1to 0pt#1 # 1 # 1 to size # 1 = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx10 scaled 2 = cmti8 scaled2 ps. 2 = 6truein galaxies : active galaxies : individual : f10214 +4724 quasars : absorption lines intergalactic medium galaxies : starburst
we describe an approximate scheme for solving the bethe - salpeter equation for a massive, covariant quark - diquark model of the nucleon. this model describes the interaction of a massive quark with a small cluster of diquarks in the vicinity of the six - point function where the spectator quark is expected to be present. we solve the equations for the components of the covariant nucleon wave function in momentum space using a one - dimensional eigenvalue formalism coupled to a two - particle generalization of the faddeev equations which describes the interactions for disconnected scattering amplitudes. under the mild additional assumption that the 2-quark interactions are independent of the 3- and 4- quark coupling constants, we find that the computational scheme approximates the previously known computations for the scalar and axialvector contributions to the three - quark scattering amplitude by a factor of roughly two. the basis of our approximation scheme is a simple description of the general structures of the diquerent bound state as a covariant sum over all three - particle irreducible diagrams. we illustrate our approach with data from the recently measured four - momentum of the k1-ev kaon at @xmath0. in the early 90 s, a. antognini @xcite and the late - time fluctuations of the kaon had already begun to intrude in the study of the properties of massive, momentum space quarks. at that time, there were reported measurements of the wigner indices of the several - gev nucleon bound state in the energy range, and it was soon recognized that the scattering of quarks and antiquarks can sometimes be used to infer information about the mass of a quark cluster in a certain energy range. at the same time, the degree of freedom of the bound state is known to be a highly nontrivial function of the excited state, and as a consequence of the various known observables, such as the excited - state mass ratio and the on - shell nucleon energy, can be accurately evaluated in the momentum space. recently, it has been realized that there exists a well - defined class of observables whose description can be performed with relatively simple forms, _ e.g. _, the normalized 4-vectors of the effective spectrum of the five - momentum nucleon, and for the special case of the complex ( _ i.e. timelike ) nucleon momentum. these include color, spin, and flavor couplings @
we present the results of integral field spectroscopic observations of the pa@xmath0 line emission nebulae in four ultraluminous infrared galaxies, iras 1019547e, ngc 7316, irs 10190@xday22, irp 10329 + 190638, and ngc 4372, taken with the palomar 200-inch telescope. the line emission is studied using the spatial and velocity fields of the emission line gas, which are found to be spatially and spectrally unresolved at the current resolution. the four galaxies are selected from the 2 jy galaxy sample of @xcite, and are observed simultaneously in two dimensions using the pifs to obtain line - emission information across a contiguous two - dimensional field of view, allowing for essentially seeing - limited spatial resolution in both dimensions. when combined with longslit spectroscopy, this data allows for a time lag relative to the time since the last close encounter for individual galaxies, which allows one to reconstruct the merger history of the constituent galaxies. the resulting time delay between the first and final encounters motivates the study of the latest stages of the merger process, revealing time delays of @xmath1 yr in the build - up of the largest star - forming regions, suggestive of lengthy relaxation timescales between close encounters. it is found that the star formation rates in the extended nebular regions in these galaxies are large, with peak rates of 1020 _ ( _ i.e. _, of order of 10 gyr at 2 months prior to the first close encounter ). these rates are comparable to those found in the nuclei of ulirgs found at very early times, suggesting that the galaxies are in a post - merger remnant. comparisons to molecular gas merger models lend further support to the conclusions that the luminous galaxies in the early phase of merging are remnants of gas - rich spirals that were disrupted after a close encounter with the progenitor galaxies. merger remnants are also found at late times in the merger, with one galaxy exhibiting evidence for strong agn activity, and another for a tail extending for several orders of magnitude into the intermediate phase. the wide range of observed in the present sample and the bimodal distribution of galaxy morphologies strongly supports the idea that lirgs represent the tail of the first - encounter ulirg burst, and that they should appear as a precursor to the final merger.
we present new @xmath0 observations of the faint sub - mm source hdf850.1, obtained with the subaru telescope by hughes et al. ( 2001 ) and the iram pdb interferometer. the new image reveals an elongated feature which we interpret as the location of the elliptical galaxy 3 - 586.0. this conclusion is strengthened by a re - analysis of the previously published merlin+vla 1.4-ghz radio image of the hdf. this yields a 4-@xmath1 detection at the level of 99.9 % confidence, with a further 0.1 arcsec from the new near - infrared counterpart, yielding an accuracy of 98.7 %. the photometric and astrometric properties of the new candidate identify are described in detail. we find the source to be marginally detected in the hst nicmos f160w image of hdf 850.1. we calculate the probability that this source is coincident with the mm / sub - millimeter position of the scuba source, by comparison with published optical and radio data. we conclude that, true or otherwise, the most likely scenario for this discovery is that the host galaxy is a luminous early - type galaxy situated within a fair circular orbit of the hubble deep field. this scenario is supported by the fact that the new identification is significantly more extended than in the corresponding hst images, and suggests that the galaxy may be gravitationally lensed. we show that a similarly enlarged but marginally detected elliptical in the vla pdb image also might be lensed, and that, if so, the lensing process is likely to have produced a false image. finally, we discuss the implications of our results for standard measurements of star - formation density at high redshift.

the intensity distribution of an all - dielectric photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) with a triangular air - hole lattice and a regular lattice of air - holes running along the fiber axis is studied. we present a simple linear combination of the near - field and far - field intensity distributions to explain both the shape and the radiation pattern in the transition from the near to the far field. from the decomposition of the intensity distribution we have determined the mode field diameter and effective area of the pcf. we find that the shape of the mode at focus has a hexagonal shape that first transforms into a close - to - circular profile followed by a shape rotated by @xmath0 with respect to the six inner holes surrounding the core, and finally transforms into the original hexagonal orientation with six satellites emerging from the distribution. the rotation of the satellites is caused by an interference between the different gaussian elements used to determine the moduli of the fundamental mode. after re - rotating the satellites, the satellites are found to be fully developed and, in fact, they are fully oriented in the same way as in the experiment. moreover the relative intensities between the satellites and the main peak of the emitted intensity profile are more than two orders of magnitude lower than the peak. if the interference nature of the interference is properly taken into account the experimental observations can lead to an interpretation of the above results in terms of a mode field elongation in the photonic band - gap. 99 t. j. kippenberg and k.j. vahala, ` ` single - mode optical crystal fibers, '' j. lightwave technol. * 24 *, 275282 ( 1997 ). m. m. seitz, s. gonzlez - daz, d. miocin, m. ibanescu, j. p. torres, f. ledbetter, p. keller, and s. strumia f. rolston,``abstract.

we prove that, for holomorphic functions whose gradient is a positive holomorphy potential, the trace - free ricci tensor of the corresponding solution of the einstein - maxwell equations is equal to the associated khler form of the hermitian metric. we also show that, when the function has constant scalar curvature, the resulting solution is isomorphic to the khler metric of the same curvature. this last result garnered considerable attention from the mathematics community, but also leads to a number of intriguing surprises. for instance, we showed that, in the special case of smooth khler manifolds, it is possible to write in the form @xmath0=2 f^+\circ f^-$ ] the holomorphic vector field of a local khler manifold, and at the same time prove the existence of a constant part of the self - dual component of that representation. on the other hand, we also present the results of deturck and kazdan, which suggest that such a holomorphic function is either not smooth, or has differentiability classes. this article has two main sections. in the first, we provide an overview of the work of matsushima and lichnerowicz on _ elliptic regularity _ and the proof of the theorem by zhang and wilson ; in the second section, we discuss some key results of the theory of derdziski, lemma, and calabi, and theorems due to br @xcite. throughout the article, we maintain a very low level of knowledge of the mathematics of complex manifolds ; the purpose of this note is to give a brief and incomplete account of some of the results contained in sections 2 and 3. finally, we emphasize certain symmetry properties of the solutions, which will hopefully be of interest to future mathematicians.
we analyze the environmental dependence of galaxy bars and bulges, using a volume - limited catalogue of 15810 nearly face - on disc galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey, with visual morphology classifications from galaxy zoo 2. we characterize galaxies by their properties, or marks ", such as their luminosity, colour, morphological type, stellar mass, star formation rate, etc. in most galaxy clustering analyses, the halo model framework has been used to interpret the correlations of luminosity and colour marks in terms of the correlation between halo mass and environment. we find a strong correlation between the bar likelihood ( @xmath0 ) and fracdev, their environmental dependence, and their relation to each other and to galaxy colour and stellar mass we find that redder and more massive disc galaxies are up to twice as likely to have bars than their bluer low - mass counterparts. we also find correlations of bar and bulge strengths with bulge strength ( 24acdev ), but with less scatter. the latter correlations agree with the colour - stellar mass correlation, suggesting that barred redder galaxies are more likely to be hosted by more massive haloes. regarding the colour dependence, we argue that it is partially due to the change in stellar mass that led to the transition from disc to bar - dominated to bulge - dominated galaxies : the colours of red, high - mass disc galaxies have about twice as many bars ( up to approximately twice the number of barred galaxies ) as disc galaxies with no bars, whereas the lack of bars in disc galaxies is more common. the bar - environment correlation is not related to colour or stellar mass but must be due to environmental effects or to another independent parameter ( e.g., angular momentum distribution ). we compare our results with mock galaxy catalogues and halo occupation models from literature, designed to test the predictions of dark matter halo models. the haloes that host barred and unbarred galaxies are generally found to have central light excesses similar to that observed in the lower - mass haloes, while the majority of the disk galaxies have bars.

we observed abell 1689 with _ suzaku _ and detected the intracluster medium ( icm ) emission out to the virial radius. from the spatial profile of the icm emission, we derive radial profiles of temperature, electron density, and entropy, and compare them with the x - ray observables obtained from a joint strong and weak lensing analysis. the temperature profile in the offset1 direction is in good agreement with the scaled temperature one, while the temperatures in the other directions ( offset2 - offset4 ) are lower than the scaled value by a factor of @xmath0. the slope of the electron number density is @xfig1 in intermediate range of angles between the cluster centers. the entropy profile of offset1 region is anisotropic, similarly to the temperature ones. however, unlike the temperature, the entropy anisotropies are caused by the large - scale structure in the outskirts. in particular, the temperature and entropy values in the last radial bin are smaller than those in the beginning one, indicating that the accretion shocks are not responsible for the temperature anomalies in the cluster outskirts, where the thermal pressure is not sufficient to balance the total cluster gravitational mass. based on this accretion shock scenario, we discuss the hydrostatic equilibrium in the vicinity of the cluster cores, and derive the cluster mass profiles by including the lensing effect. we find that the observed lensing profile is well fitted by a navarro - frenk - white mass profile, in spite of the large systematic offsets between the two mass measurements. the strong lensing mass profile is indicative of a hierarchical structure, in which the large scale structure plays an important role. the cluster core is consistent with the scenario of cold dark matter ( cdm ) infall along filamentary structures. in the cdm scenario, the dynamical heating processes within the cluster do not play a significant role.
we present a variety of quantum ram designs that allow for the flexibility of solid - state implementations of quantum computers. we call them ` fanout'qrams because they are based on the concept of a quantum bus, and take advantage of the fact that qubits are treated as if they were quantum bits. the main difference between fanout and conventional fanout designs is that they both require the coherence to be preserved over an exponential number of connections, while fanout qrams can be implemented using single electron transistors and coulomb blockade. in contrast, the quantum version of the fanout scheme requires a collection of controlled phase gates, making it prone to breakdown. we present an implementation of a fanout quantum ram where all the phase gates are controlled by a single electron, in the form of a ` ` bus '' qubit. for small @xmath0, the bus qubit interacts with a set of quantum switches in the binary tree, one of which is quantum mechanically constrained to not point ` ` up '' or ` ` down '' at the address of the memory cell. we also present a coherent raman implementation of the bucket - brigade qram, in which coherent information is stored on two qubits and subsequently re - emitted in the appropriate spatial mode of the bus bus. finally, we construct detailed physical designs for qrams. parallel implementations are also presented, taking into account the possibility of hybrid encodings where the bus and the memory cells are implemented by different physical objects ( e.g. photons vs. trapped atoms ). quantum information processing has made substantial progress in the last decade, with the release of high - performance quantum computers, such as the quantum computers ( see for example @xcite ). a common problem in these architectures is the creation of a sufficient number of quantum bits ( qubits ) that are coherently available for the processing of any quantum system. in particular, the requirement of quantum coherence has been shown to be critical in the development of quantum algorithms, with gate error rates that can reach hundreds of qubits per single - qubit on a single photon ( see ref. ). although this feat has been accomplished, it has proven to be challenging, and practical implementations are still in the process of being realized. during the past few years, experimental progress has been made in the field of quantum nanotechnology. on the other hand, the experimental and theoretical side of the problem has been very promising, with reported demonstrations of quantum gates and algorithms being made possible thanks to new techniques. in
we present a new quantitative measure, the number of correlated events in bursty sequences, which measures correlations and heterogeneity in spatially extended temporal signals. it is derived from the inter - event time distribution and it is endowed with an exponent that reflects the strength of temporal correlations between independent events. it offers a better characterization of correlated heterogeneous signals that can not be observed from the autocorrelation function and other system - dependent exponents. consequently, it provides direct evidence of correlations up to finite time scales, which can be used to better understand the dynamics of temporally correlated bursty signals. our study is based on time - stamped records of communication through different channels for a large number of individuals and we demonstrate that the observed scaling behavior of @xmath0, the ` ` correlated '' event number distribution, is not an artifact of the averaging method and can be attributed to memory effects. at the same time, the data show exponential, scale - invariant distributions with power - law long temporal correlations, indicating the existence of scale - free dynamical systems. the framework presented here provides a phenomenological model that captures the common features of the observed patterns and helps us to understand better how these features are related to each other. information is usually stored in the system as a sequence of discrete events. in the present study we focused on temporal signals of individuals. a common feature of this information is the presence of long bursty trains, which are composed of sequences of independent events that evolve with time. these trains can be viewed as the result of building up sufficient stress in the individual entities ( or in clusters ). the distribution of the length of the spike trains and their correlation properties are found to be fat - tailed. neuronal activity patterns are analyzed by analyzing the firing patterns of single neurons. we found correlations between consecutive bursty spikes of the same neuron in the same system ( neurons ), which reflect similar behavior of the system at a single time and place. this ` ` ` one - trigger - one - task '' hypothesis can be relevant for human communication.
in many applications a vendor needs to get supply of an item from @xmath0 different producers. on any given day however, there is a fixed cost to starting and/or ending a relationship with any new producer. the goal of the vendor is to minimize the sum total of these two costs : an ` ` acquisition cost '' such that only a small number of constraints are ever picked. the paging problem is a special case of where the underlying matroid is a uniform one. the problem faced by the vendor in this model has both covering and packing constraints. phrasing it as a covering problem ( with box constraints ) enables us to use, as a black - box, results on the fractional problem for which avoidance of the first constraint is possible. going from uniform to general matroids, we show that such a loss is unavoidable unless we use exponential time. it is natural to ask whether simple combinatorial problems for which the one - shot problem is easy to solve also admit good algorithms for the multistage version. @xcite consider a problem on _ matroid maintenance _, where all acquisition costs are the same, and the problem is reduced to the analogous problem of maintaining a spanning set of a given matroid. they obtain an lp - rounding algorithm which approximates the total cost up to a logarithmic factor. in this work we study a generalization of their problem. the basic difference between their problem and ours is that they consider a single matroid ; we consider the same matroid for all time periods. we first show that the problem can be reduced to a covering - covering problem, and then consider the related problem when the replacement of the matroid by a new one. we then give a simple greedy algorithm for making the optimal solution available at any time for any _ constant _ acquisition cost, and make it easy to find an optimal solution which is simple to approximate. for the online case, we present an improved version of the algorithm which is based on a linear - time rounding technique and also provides a linear time finding solution.
the problem of efficient growth is often referred to as the primal lp problem, for short because it focuses on the most difficult part of the metabolic process, i.e. the uptake and discharge of substrates from the environment. we analyse genome - scale metabolic models which include growth - limiting substrates, and present the results of a statistical analysis of the shadow price distributions. we find that there is typically little correlation between the shadow prices and the conserved molecular quantities. we then show how shadow prices can be used to generate edge - associated flux networks analogous to the conventional non - equilibrium thermodynamics. this allows the study of the trade - offs between rate of growth and molecular weight, which is of interest in metabolic models. there has been much recent interest in the metabolic properties of living organisms @xcite. reactions in the gut eukaryotic cells, for example, are commonly described by the stoichiometry matrix @xmath0, which in an approximation is the input into a reaction network, such as the metabolic rate of the _ escherichia coli _ or the rate at which water is made available to the micro - organisms. at the scale of the central metabolism, reactions are typically small since only a small fraction of the reactions have a large energy cost, so they do not contribute significantly to the overall metabolic rate. however, there is a significant gap between the so - called internal reactions, which include all the major biochemical transformations of the organism, and external ` external'reactions which involve metabolites in their expression or production. this has been pointed out in a number of studies @xcitethat metabolic models may lack certain features. for example it has been shown that metabolic networks in the _ e. coli _ gene - repository bin are not ` internal'but contain a small subset of reactions with different molecular weights, each of which is associated with a different cost. in this study we extend this by considering a metabolic network which includes metabolism, but also contains information about metabolism from the outside. this will allow us to develop a rigorous framework to deal with the primal and dual lp problems, and also develop a pair of complementary solutions.
we consider spin-1/2 superconducting states ( scs ) and their relation to angular momentum and the phase angle in the double topology of the standard model ( ms ). due to the double covering property, quantum states on ms are related to classical analogues of fermions in a similar manner, i.e., they become periodic in the ms, carrying a circle periodicity on the ms. in the case of the uncertainty relation on ms, we derive a set of mininum uncertainty relations for cs and scs associated to minimum uncertainty relation states, which are found to be consistent for the ms topology. in addition, we find that scs on ms turn to be periodic under a period of the same order as those on the bosonic ms. we also consider the connection between scs and cat states and demonstrate that their periodicity is a property of the ms also for the antiferromagnetic case. finally, we numerically demonstrate that the periodicity of scs is a consequence of the magnetic and electric dipole - dipole correspondence, and we discuss the direction of the investigation of this relationship in the light of the recent experimental results on fermionic dark matter where it is proven to be an excellent approximation to the quantum smoluchowski statistics @xcite. as a characteristic feature of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in two dimensions, the two - spin system has been at the forefront of the condensed matter physics for the last thirty years. in experiments, the system is investigated in detail in the millenium years, making a complete characterization of quantum states a theoretical priority. one of the most active areas of quantum and classical physics at the present day is the search for the quantum equivalent of the classical states in a variety of systems. a particular class of such quantum states is the spectrally symmetric quantum state ( cs ), that is characterized by the jacobi theta function @xmath0 that describes spin - one - body interactions, and the quantum phase transition ( at zero temperature ), giving rise to an angular invariance of the system, is a classical analog of the periodic s - wave function, or the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) effect. the cs can be seen as a universal quantum counterpart of the kt effect, with a symmetry invariance parameter, and hence it is a promising candidate for the description of quantum as well as classical condensed matter systems. the interest to the study of cs quantum computation on ms has
we present results from multi - epoch water maser observations carried out with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) toward the star - forming region afgl 2591 at three epochs ( 2001 december 2, 2002 february 11, and 2002 march 5 ), to search for and study maser emission toward a group of masers associated with a high - mass young stellar object ( yso ) located @xmath0 to the north of vla 3, and with a net exposure of about 70 mas. we identify 17 maser structures with radial velocities within a projected area of about 60 mas@xmath4. six of these structures are detected at a spatial resolution of about 0.5 mas. the maser brightness distribution shows a radial velocity gradient along the ecliptic plane of the sky, with peaks and troughs corresponding to the two bow shock - like structures seen at higher latitudes. the brightness distribution and the proper motions derived from parabolic fits to the bow shapes are all consistent with a single, parabolic bow shock model with a shape parameter of about 40 m*(1 - 0 ), moving at a velocity of 40 m*. we find that the southern bow - shock morphology is similar to that of the southern maser structure observed by sanna et al. ( 2012 ) at a lower resolution. the morphology, kinematics, and proper motion of the individual masers are consistent with an oblate, time - independent shape and suggest that this structure is a low - mass, young star ( at an assumed distance of 400 au ) moving along a well - collimated jet from the central source. the fainter maser population observed at higher resolution, but with a similar angular size and shape to those seen at lower resolution, suggests that a still undetected central massive yso(s ) may be responsible for the observed maser activity. we failed to detect a maser source at the angular resolution of our data, but detect small lsr velocity shifts of the masers in the southern 600 au region.

we study the linear response of the accretion disk of a strongly magnetized neutron star to an axisymmetric rotating magnetic field. in particular, we focus on the effect of a small perturbation in the disk magnetic field asymmetry which results from the lense - thirring precession of the compact object. this is done for newtonian, as well as for pseudo - general relativistic gravitational potentials in the kerr spacetime. unlike in black hole binaries where the orbital frequency is a linear combination of the keplerian and magneto - acoustic waves, in this case the qpo frequencies are independent of the disk warping or precession. moreover, the logarithmic frequency of the response is linear in the sense that @xmath0 for a fixed value of the magnetic moment aligned with the rotation axis of the star. for strong asymmetry, this linearity in the response can be combined with the dragging effect to explain the low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in some low mass x - ray binaries. however, for weak asymmetry in the magnetic field, these effects are absent and the regime remains quasi - linear. in order to understand the origin of these phenomena, we perform numerical mhd simulations of the innermost stable circular orbit of a slowly rotating neutron star. we find that an asymmetric magnetic field can remove the global magnetic warping, but an additional process can prevent the disk from being in equilibrium : resonance. this process causes the resonant frequencies to decrease and, therefore, can explain the qpos observed in lmxbs. the resonance conditions for a weakly magnetized disk remain stable if the magnetic moments of the neutron star and the thin disk are aligned, while for a strong magnetic field the equatorial magnetic moment is misaligned so that the disk is in a non - equilibrium state. stars : neutron x - rays : binaries accretion, accretion discs black hole physics
we present dynamical models for ngc147, ngc185, and ngc205 dwarf elliptical galaxies. the models are constructed assuming the two to be viewed edge - on, so that the observed kinematics can be used to constrain the mass and the dark matter content. we estimate the b - band mass - to - light ratio, @xmath0, within a radius of 2@xmath1, or 160 kpc at the distance of the m31 satellite galaxy. the mass distribution can be modeled as a sum of a weighted sum of basis functions with slope and tangential component at each radius. the stellar density and the radial, tangential, and vertical components of the velocity dispersion tensor are derived as a function of position angle, luminosity, and axis ratio. the velocity dispersions decrease away from the center, with only a slight decline in the innermost kpc, beyond 5. ngc153 is the only one of these galaxies to show clear rotation, and it is situated close to m31 but is too faint to be selected from the hst images in the optical or near - infrared. based on the observed rotation curves, we define a scale radius of ( 0.5 kpc or 1.2 @xft ) for ngg153, which is about 50 % larger than the projection radius of the bright globular cluster ngc5120 in the hubble space telescope ( hst ) image of ngc749. in order to get a better estimate for the inclination of the best fit model, we therefore produced model templates that omit the inclination and increase the brightness of the central few kpc by a factor of 3. the model templates reproduce the observed brightness profiles and kinematical data well, but it does not include the expected truncation of the stellar velocity distribution at about 50 kpc. the overall shape of the models agrees with the major - axis velocity data of simien & prugniel.
we present @xmath0 far - ultraviolet spectroscopy of the prototypical dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705 obtained within the lifetime of the hubble space telescope ( hst ), which is an ideal test - case for probing the physical properties of all the phases of interstellar gas in starburst galaxies. we use the new spectra to probe the outflowing gas in the galaxy s dusty ism : molecular gas, neutral atomic gas, warm gas photoionized by hot stars, and collisionally - heated coronal gas. we detect the first detection of the interstellar @xcite absorption - line in this galaxy as well as other confirmed and suspected detections from lyman - break absorption, which indicates that the gas is interacting with gas that is moving in a disk - like structure. the size, morphology, outflow speed, mass, kinetic energy, and dynamical age of this structure are all consistent with a simple model of an adiabatic superbubble whose expansion is driven by a piston of hot gas that has been driven by the cumulative effect of the supernovae in the starburst. we argue that most of the kinetic energy and mass deposited by the central supernova in this outflow are ` ` blown - out '' rather than being radiated away. thus, we are witnessing the blow - out in the coronal - phase gas, where the supernova energy is being dissipated rather than radiatively cooled down to temperatures that are consistent with supernova - driven radiative cooling. this result supports the idea that starburst - driven outflows are important for the evolution of dwarf galaxies, in particular to the low metal abundances of this type of galaxy. we also show that the outflow velocity and flow speed are both consistent with the predictions of a simple spherical shell model and are significantly higher than those predicted by the ionization simulations. as a result, we conclude that dynamical time scales are too high for the classic superbubbles to produce the significant outflow velocities and masses of gas that we observe in - absorption. on the other hand, we show that stellar feedback is likely playing an important role in the dynamical evolution of this galaxy and that it may be leading to the formation of a large - scale outflow.
we study the electron transport in films of heavily phosphorous ( p)-doped si nanocrystals that touch each other at transport limiting facets. we experimentally observe that the average conductance between ncs increases monotonically with the nominal doping concentration @xmath0 as found in previous work. this is due to the appearance of a plasmonic top shell in p - doped si ncs. the localized surface plasmons in the films exhibit an anderson localization ( mit ) condition, where the average density of states of electrons quasiclassically follows the shklovskii criterion. we derive a universal criterion for the mit condition, which is in quantitative agreement with our x - ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results. the mit criterion specifies a universal scaling of the localization length from 1 to 20 % of the nc diameter and an effective dielectric constant from 3 to 5@xmath1 from the ratio of the effective electron mass in the semiconductor nc to the free electron mass. we also present a detailed discussion of the universality of this approach. * keywords : * semiconducting ncs, metal chalcogenide semiconductors, heavy fermion materials, electron transport, mit the electronic structure of modern semiconductor nanostructures has attracted a great deal of attention due to their unique properties such as field effect transistor applications and high power conversion efficiency @xcite. the study of transport properties of ncs has also helped in understanding the effects of disorder and in designing new semiconductor devices. for example, poly - conjugated semiconductor solar cells ( pcs ) with geometrical cut - offs in mid- to far - infrared absorption spectroscopy ( nmr ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) have been a useful tool to investigate the doping effect on nc transport properties. in this work we study the effect of disorder on the metallic transport of electrons in phosphorous si nc films. we apply the bohr - bohm - dolinar ( bdl ) formalism to study the electrical transport in ncs and find that for a given by the concentration of the active dopants, the ncs are subject to a mit condition if their average electron density within a nc is greater than a critical value, which in the case of quantum - confined ncs is about 50 %. in the opposite case, in nc arrays made up of spherical plates, mit occurs if the number of electrons per
we study the evolution of spherically symmetric clouds in the presence of an intense ultraviolet background ( uvb ), focusing on the effects of self - shielding of the gas and h@xmath0 cooling. we also investigate the formation of population iii objects ( dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies ). we find that the central region of a cloud is able to form hydrogen before the cloud reaches the turn - around radius, and that the subsequent cooling is very effective to keep the gas ionized below @xmath10k. the central object is found to be subject to run - away collapse in the dark matter potential and does not settle into hydrostatic equilibrium. for plausible uv spectra and velocity fields, this corresponds to a population iv population having formed through collision of ionizing photons with the post - shock gas. we obtain self - similar results with previous simulations, in spite of the different gas properties we consider. in this paper, we confirm and complement our previous study ( ikhsan et al. 2000 ) by systematically taking into account the radiative transfer of uv photons. this is the first attempt to provide a self - consistent picture of star formation. we explore several possible cooling mechanisms in collapsing clouds. we have concentrated on the virialized clouds, since in these cases the star formation can proceed efficiently and is expected to be very strong. furthermore, we consider the case of hii regions and estimate the heating and ionization produced in the hii region, in combination with the photoionization of h and potential solar heating. the conversion from the hi to the hi one takes place when the cloud becomes optically thick against the ionizing photon. the final result of the simulations is shown to be consistent with that found in the earlier studies, even if some gas in collapsed clouds ends up in stellar systems. galaxies : formation ultraviolet background.
recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) spectrum reveal that a large scale curvature of the universe at large distance, when traced back at the time of inflation, modifies the frequency of the inflationary perturbations. the modifications are highly sensitive to the parameters of the background geometry ; the scale - invariance of the spectrum and the amplitude of the first acoustic peak. in this work we investigate claims that a modified large - distance curvature may offer an alternative explanation for the sn1a data. we studied the sensitivity of cmb spectrum to the whole range of modes, @xmath0, when short and large distance regimes are modified. our results, in a de sitter background space, reveal : the spectrum is insensitive to the details of _ short - distance physics _ and the cuttoff scale _ ( the transplanckian regime ) only for an _ initial adiabatic vacuum state _ ; the scales of the curvature modifications are within the range of the classical frw scale. the cmbfast plots of this class of models, yield a scale invariant spectrum which is well - defined and goes beyond the standard frw model. any curvature corrections in the large scale region, are tightly constrained from cmb data to be within the frw universe scales. the issue of curvature backreaction in this regime is still an open question. although it is counterintuitive, since large distance would correspond to low - energy theories, our results indicate that any modifications in the big bang physics, are very tightly constraining. cmbfig.

we present an analysis of the optical and x ray properties of a sample of 24 clusters of galaxies observed as part of the x ray multi mirror large scale structure ( lssc ) survey. sixteen of the clusters are optically detected and display redshifts in the range @xmath0. the remainder are non - spectroscopically identified and display x ray luminosities and optical richness that are typical of groups or low mass clusters. all clusters, despite the primary x ray selection and low x ray flux / optical richness displayed by the majority of the sample, display a statistical overdensity of galaxies of similar colour, that makes them detectable by an almost 3 dimensional search defined by sky position and colour. we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of x ray detected clusters is indistinguishable from that of optically undetected clusters and that the methods presented in this paper alone provide a robust method to identify cluster members. although most clusters do not exhibit large spatial overdensities in x rays, we show that the absence of an extended x ray _ emission _ component in xlssc 007 indicative of a low stellar mass population is consistent with the galaxy being formed at an early epoch and then passively evolved from that epoch. we estimate that at least 10 % of the cluster galaxies are expected to have undergone at least one episode of secondary star formation, in addition to the old stellar populations seen in lower redshift systems, suggesting that the cluster lf is not well described by a single evolutionary model. however, the current data set appears to support the presence of both a passive and active population at high redshift, thus extending the conclusions of previous studies into the redshift regime. the mean cluster galaxy lf continues to evolve with redshift according to the prediction of a passively evolving population, however, there is now compelling evidence for an additional luminosity evolution term in the lf, beyond that expected from passive evolution on the basis of passive evolution alone. we present tentative evidence for such a term in our lf analysis.

rosat is the largest all - sky x - ray survey performed so far, detecting hundreds of interesting sources. these objects are most likely to be agn, however due to synchrotron radiation their continua are linear compared to the characteristic planck curve for the stars. hence, only high quality spectra and very accurate reduction may reveal their spectral energy distribution and prove their nature. many extragalactic objects have been identified by means of rosat and/or other programs, establishing a homogeneous sample of objects for further studies. two main projects have been carried out : hamburg rosat catalogue ( hrc ), zickgraf et al. 2003 ) and byurakan - hamburg co - analysis ( bhrc *, mickaelian 2015 ). hrc is based on rosat bright source catalogue and contains 18,806 sources at @xmath0 cts@xmath1 0.04 ct / s from the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ), while fsc contains 105,924 sources from the rosat faint source catalogue ( fsc ). in hrc, some 8132 sources have been optically identified, the largest sample of identified rosat sources. combining data from the two catalogues, we have improved many errors and misidentifications and established a new, homogeneous, classification of objects. it includes 16,905 sources, of which 85 % are classified as agn candidates. the types of objects included in our classification are : bright galaxies, blue galaxies, interacting galaxies, red galaxies ( typically red colours ), cataclysmic variables ( mostly bright and blue ), blue compact galaxies ( bcg ), and quasars ( qsos ). we also include some examples of uv - selected agn and starburst galaxies. galaxies : clusters : general x - rays : galaxies intergalactic medium
the atlas planar pixel sensor r&d project is aimed at improving the performance of the atlas inner tracking system in the energy range of the large hadron collider ( lhc ). to achieve slim edges and high hit efficiencies at the highest received fluences, a new read - out design is used in the production of 1744 pixel modules. the individual pixel module is composed of a 250@xmath0 m thick n - in - n sensor interconnected by the solder bump bonding technique, and the high voltage insulation is tested in a beam test at the cern sps with 120gev pions. the modules encapsulated with parylene - c have been tested up to 650v, and no destructive discharges are seen. after an irradiation to the highest fluence of up to @xmath1 up to 1kv the collected charge exceeds the threshold of 3.2ke by a factor of 2, and on average the hit efficiency is 88 % at 0.5ke when employing an atlas fe - i3 sensor, as determined from the measurement of the differential and total collected charge as a function of the received fluence. in a preliminary study it was found that at a given bias voltage 88 % hit efficiency with a lower hit efficiency of 1.8 % was reached at the threshold, within the geometric considerations. the expected hit efficiency for the el dorado factory is expected to increase to at least 88 % within two years, and then to be at least 90 % for the next generation of atlas detectors. + * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * desy 10 - 049 march 2010 at the cmr collider @xcite ( hamc ) * * atlas : institut fr kernphysik und astrophysik, + werner heisenbergstrae 1, d-85790 frankfurt ( germany ), germanyshev laboratory, + * preprint * ( the first version of this contribution has been submitted to european physical review d.c. ) * abstract * + _ title of the paper : _ catalogue number : _ + _ version _ : 0.0 in press + _ catalogue identifier _ : + _ program obtainable from _ : cpc program library, queen s university belfast, n. ireland + _ licensing provisions _ : none + _ programming language _ : fortran 90 + _ computer _ : any computer with
we use repeat observations of the southern equatorial stripe drawn from the sloan digital sky survey to measure the photometric covariance for the five sdss filters. we sub - divide the sample by color, object type and magnitude. we use the regression matrix to determine the uncertainties in observing the data. we find that the observed scatter is a strong function of magnitude and object type. galaxies observed with ( the preferred aperture for sdss colors ) had a strongly covariant regression matrix, with correlations between the @xmath0, @xfig1, @xsmath2, and [ xmm - newton ] bands in excess of 70 % for all colors and magnitudes. these correlations were very strong for the sdss quasar sample and for the variable stellar objects used in object selection. when these variables were removed from the sample, the correlation between the apertures was negligible and the pipeline errors were consistent with the observations. for the color band, the color errors were typically under - estimated by 10 - 20 % relative to the observed color scatter. the scatter at the bright end was typically a function of whether or not the galaxy had been deblended from a larger group. bright isolated galaxies had smaller scatter relative to their deblened counterparts, although the ratio between the measured scatter and pipeline errors remained large. we compare these measurements to the scatter expected from the magnitude errors in the five filters. for relatively bright galaxies, the predicted scatter is in the range of 1 to 3. for quasars and variable stars, it is likely that the range is larger than 3 and that the scatter is correlated between the various bands. when deblending is taken into account, the expected scatter for bright objects is 15 - 25 % smaller than the estimated scatter. these results can be used to address the issue of making use of the covariance matrix in photometric analyses.
we present a study of the stellar envelope properties of central regions of nine early - type galaxies observed with spitzer / irac. the images provide a nearly complete picture of the major axis out to 20 kpc, including the bulge - dominated central regions and the extended components. we find that the spitzer color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) observed around seven of the nine galaxies have profiles that are more extended than the typical exponential disks typically detected in hierarchical galaxy formation simulations. for those galaxies that could be approximated by exponential disks ( srsic profiles ), the slope of the profiles is generally steeper and flatter than might be expected if the true bulge and stellar envelopes are created by the same merger processes, so we hypothesize that the stars in the accreted satellites should sit deeper in the potential wells of their dark matter sub - halos than simulated in the hierarchical models. merger models show that the radiation from these stars should be suppressed in small, dense dark matter halos and that the combined envelope and bulge profiles should be shallower and fainter than the canonical exponential thin disk. we confirm this tendency in a number of galaxies. in most of the massive galaxies the central bulge regions are highly concentrated. however, not all galaxies. ngc3031/m81 and ngc5236/m83, two of the most massive galaxies in our sample, show no sign of stellar envelope substructure. in fact, the central region of ngc4565 in this galaxy appears to have a relatively smooth and undisturbed. the disk of the nearby ( @xmath0@xmath1200 kpc ) galaxy ngc4244 is marginally brighter than the rgb main sequence star counts in the region 30 kpc from the nucleus, but is otherwise very similar in mass, luminosity, and scale size. our profiles are thus most likely to have been created by secular evolution driven by the secular evolution of small sub - halo substructure, rather than by major merger events. we briefly discuss the implications of our results for the substructure studies of massive galaxies.

the non - linear force - free field ( nlfff ) model has been thought to be a good approximation to the actual physical state of the coronal magnetic fields. however, because the bie model takes into account only the asymptotic condition consistently, it allows us to only use bottom boundary data as the boundary condition. in the present work, we apply the direct boundary integral equation ( dbie ) method to reconstruct the 3d magnetic field structures of active region noaa 11158 in the corona. not only the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) and b(ehind ) spacecraft, but also stereo images are also analyzed. three - dimensional field configurations are obtained from the front and stereo a / b views. the reconstructed topology is stereoscopically presented for the first time with comparison to observation from three points of view. our results demonstrate that the dbie method is effective when it is applied to the underlying photospheric magnetogram. the gpu acceleration makes dbie tractable even if applied to large - scale domains. from the reconstructed field structures, we can estimate the altitude of euv loop patterns which we found to be below 86 mm, or 40 % of the length of the magnetogram area. as a result, we obtained the magnetic field and current density distributions along the filament cross section in the pil, and the current density distribution in the central region where we found a strong electric current density. although the field structures in pil could be similar to the ones in the euv filament, we would not attribute them to being located along the electric current channel. instead, we attributed this phenomenon to an altitude of the filament which could be located at any point in the pole facing the sun. although our results agree very well with the observations, we argue that the actual field structures and structures in the actual solar activity could be quite different.
we study numerically the role of a massive gas disk in driving the evolution of a binary black hole ( mbh ) binary. in our previous paper we presented results for a relatively simple idealized case in which the gas is assumed to be in a nearly spherical and relatively smooth distribution, and we found that important differences in the efficiency of coalescence of binary mbhs, compared to a stellar background medium, are due to the gas s ability to open a circumbinary gap in the central 100pc of the disk. in the present paper we study more realistic models in which gas is in a disk with significant clumpiness. we do not attempt a fully realistic description of the gas in merging galaxies, but adopt a simple polytropic equation of state with a variable coefficient that allows us to represent gas with a varying degree of clumpness and we are able to represent the observed range of densities in merging systems. we find that in all of the cases considered, the coalescence timescale varies between @xmath0 and @xfig1, or between 2.5 and 12 initial orbital periods. the final evolution of the binary mbh is driven by feedback effects from stellar stars, including supernova explosions and feedback from stellar winds, and this feedback plays an important role in the inner regions of merging galaxies where massive clumps have been observed. in all cases, the _ total _ gas mass is comparable to the dynamical mass derived from the rotation curve, but the gas accounts for less than 10 % of the total mass in the mbh binary. we also find that an ellipsoidal density enhancement occurs when the binary is moving close enough to the region of active star formation to reduce the binary separation to distances comparable to where gravitational radiation becomes important. this leads to a _ transition _ in the sense that in the transition regime the gravitational drag exerted by the stellar bulge is less effective and, as a result, the binary coalescence is reduced. the fact that gas in galaxies is an important ingredient in determining the physical parameters of a merging system implies that the process of gas+ stars merging may be more common in a low - density, low - mass medium than in a high density, high - mass one.
in recent years, great experimental progress has been made in the realization of double layered quantum hall systems that allow the confinement of two layers in an integrated quantum system. it has been realized that these systems can be realized with a combination of two superconductors and a double quantum hall system. in this paper we give a semi - quantitative description of a quantum hall state in the presence of a small interlayer tunneling current that resembles the dc josephson effect in the quantum hall fluid. the gapless excitations in the ground state are realized as state transverse fluctuations of a @xmath0 quantum hall mode. the crossover from a quadratically dispersing to a linearly dispersing gapless mode is realized by suppressing a critical current between the two layers. we give an example of how this picture fits into the coherent picture of a superfluid. as a byproduct, we obtain an effective lagrangian describing the single dimensional mott - superfluid in the vicinity of the double superconducting state. we show how this effective theory is modified to describe the duality relation between two quantum hall states that are dual to each other in the limit of a large system size. this provides a simple experimentally testable prediction. institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt wrzburg, campus hubland nord, emil - fischer - str. 31, d-97074 wrzig, germany institute of theoretical physics, amsterdam, the netherlands institute of fundamental research, university of the russian academy of sciences, brussels, bratislava, slovakia 11, 00185, russia an outstanding problem in the physics of matter is the superfluidity of quantum systems at low energies. without superfluidity, there is only one energy scale to go by in the expansion of the system @xcite and thus no gauge invariants are conserved quantities. however, since the existence of superfluidity is determined by a non - trivial global symmetry breaking phase ( _ i.e. _ the lack of a back propagating mode ), a great effort has been devoted to characterize the underlying physical principle underlying superfluidity / superconductivity in terms of a gauge invariant field theory. one of the most fundamental problems in this line of research is the formation of a coherent quantum ground state. since it is impossible to directly measure the number of bosons in such a ground state, for example, the so called hopf or chern - simon condens
we report first - principles calculations of _ atomically thin films _ ( snte ) under a series of biaxial elastic strain. our above analysis reveals that monolayer sntte has an inverted gap at @xmath10 point with a negative value. we also confirmed this band inversion mechanism and the corresponding topological phase transition. we explicitly simulated the existence of the topological protected edge states. thanks to time - reversal symmetry, we can realize nontrivial topological phases in monolayers of other materials even if their bulk forms do nt have inverted gap. topological insulator ( tci ) is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological material with non - zero mirror chern number @xcite. recently, the structure of 2d tci has attracted increasing interest@xcite since it can be used as both pattern measuring device and topological spintronics ( tasi ) certified material by the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ). from an applied point of view, tci is interesting as it is the only material that can be studied in the band structure formalism, which is very distinct from bulk semiconductors. besides the fundamental gap of tci, various edge states are also protected by the mirror symmetry. for instance, gapless edge states exist in 2d tcis due to the competition between the trivial band gap and the strong crystal field effect on the band. when the onsite energy difference of the latter is big enough, these edge states can realize quantized transport. moreover, the mirror is connected with the spin in the system, which allows us to realize spin - polarized edge states in the gap. in this work, we focus on the irreducible topological materials ( such as pb, sn, and te ) and study the band structures near the periodic table ( cq ). our results demonstrate that all these materials can be realized in the cq semiconductor and that they are promising candidates for topological quantum computing. since the pioneering works by pitaevskii, ryder, and meintjie, the laws of semiconductor physics have been consistently applied to different problems. among the materials studied so far, graphene is one of the most promising applications because of its simple electrical structure which can be easily fabricated at the cost of just few hours at the laboratory. besides graphene, other materials including semi - metal gey, semi - degenerate se, te, and pby have been shown to be promising. in
the traditional measurements of the specific heat in glass - forming systems involve cooling ( or heating ) the sample at a constant rate. when the temperature is lowered at a fixed pressure this system, as in many other glass - formers, tends to form micro - clusters of local order. in the present case large particles form long - lived patches of hexagonal order first, and at lower temperatures possibly also small particles form clusters. interestingly, the two specific heat peaks ", identified in the context of the glass transition, actually correspond to the thermodynamic changes in the bulk and shear moduli of the system that are seen as a result of the micro - melting of clusters. we present a dynamical model of such a system and derive exact equations for its specific heat at constant volume, in the temperature range of the two micro - heat peaks. to the best of our knowledge, these equations have not been previously derived, and for this reason we present here our results in a simulational example ( a binary mixture of point particles interacting via a @xmath0 repulsive potential ) and a more direct comparison with experiment ( glycerol ). we show that the frequency dependent specific heat is easy to calculate, when a reasonable model of the relaxation time is taken into account. we also present evidence that the number of clusters and the distribution of cluster sizes are exactly the same in the two expressions, i.e., they do not change rapidly with the temperature or pressure. the frequency dependence specific heat can be used to discuss the physics that is behind the glassy behavior of this system. we propose that the increase in the entropy and the decrease of shear and bulk moduli are the basic reason for the existence of these two peaks, and that the system undergoes a glass transition at a temperature that is intermediate between the values of constant volume and constant pressure.
we use the nonlocal model to study pulse compression in cascaded quadratic soliton compressors. the pump, or fundamental wave, experiences an effective nonlinear phase shift from the cyclic energy transfer to the second harmonic. since the nonlinearity induced by the cascading process can be made self - defocusing the wave can compress the pulse. this implies that the system can be in the nonstationary regime where it is easier to compress a few - cycle pulse. we compress pulses in bulk nonlinear crystals with up to three - order dispersion ( tod ) by using a slowly - evolving wave approximation ( sewa ). we find that the tod is detrimental to pulse compression : in the stationary regime it distorts the compressed pulse to such a level that it is no longer useful for any practical use, and the corresponding group - velocity mismatch ( gvm ) term is much stronger. for larger gvd the gaussian distortion is much weaker, resulting in a 17 fs compressed pulse with trailing oscillations. we also find that competing cubic nonlinearities aggravate the effect of tod and prevent compression to single - cycle duration. 99 h.a. bachor, _ optical fibers : molding the flow of light _ ( princeton university press, princeton, 1995 ). e. b. siegman, ` ` nobel lecture : the manipulation of optical pulses, '' j. lightwave technol. * 26 *, 289 ( 1998 ). w.p. robertson, r.r. bradley, m.d. hoogerland, and k.s. eberler, compression of light optical pulses in vacuum, " phys. rev. lett. * 69 *, 25942597 ( 1993 ). p. domokos and h.h. chan, _ nonlinear optical pulse compression _ ( academic press, san diego, 2001 ). m.b. safavi - naeini, s.v. gorkunov, p. a. snyder ` ` experimental observations of the threshold for helium pulse compression, '' science * 320 *, 844846 ( 2003 ). a. yildiz, s.- h. wang, x.- z. zhang, f.c. kang, b.- y. liu, j. h. gong, and q. zhiang, ultrafast light pulses in fiber nonlinear materials, " opt.
the influence of the driving field on the transparency and coherence of an ultracold atom in a three - level dimerized @xmath0-type atom system is studied. a driving field is introduced in order to modulate both the atom resonance properties and the detuned dark states, which are represented by rabi frequencies. the resonant interaction of the atom with the light is considered and nonlinear coherence effects are considered. it is found that the resonantly modulated dark states generate novel phenomena such as transparency and dispersion, since there is no energy exchange between the probing light and the atom. the coherence and absorption characteristics of the atomic system are also investigated. one of the novel properties of these systems is the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( eit ), which describes the transition from resonant to steady state coherence in a time - reversal limited way@xcite. it has been extensively used in quantum information theory ( qit ) to store and retrieve information about hidden variable states. more recently, the relation between quantum information and eit has been explored in more detail in the context of spin-@xmath1 systems, in which the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) model and the multi - level structure can be successfully applied. in this paper, weethi @xcite and v.i. krishnamoorthy considered the control of the quantum information with the help of state dressing techniques. they showed that by dressing states, a wide range of decoherence - limited states can be achieved, which is useful in many applications, e.g. for instance, to store information or to extract information about the quantum state of the system. they developed a technique called adiabatic driving that allows for the manipulation of both the atomic state and the quantum coherence. recently, it was shown [ phys. rev. b * 78 *, 153128 ( 2012 ) ] that the driving - field - induced transparency ( gdh ) can be interpreted as an effect of the transparency of a detuned atom system dressed in a dark state. however, the gdh has never been experimentally realized, i.e., it is not available in nature. this difference is probably related to the fact that the atomic dark state in gdh is very dim, dark in nature, and usually, only partially dark. here, we propose a scenario in which both the tunable driving field and the dark states are modulated together with a resonant atom resonance. we will
we systematically study the spacetime structures of the static solutions in the @xmath0-dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet-@xmath1 system for general relativity, where the coefficient of the gravitating matter is non - negative. we also investigate the case of a positive / negative cosmological constant and a sub - manifold with non - spherical topology. the solutions are classified into three types. one is a black hole solution with a horizon similar to that in general relativity ; another is a slim discretized black hole with a fully degenerate horizon ; and the third is a bare black hole having no horizon at all. in all the cases, the center of mass and the asymptotic regions are determined by that term. the singularity, inner horizons, and inner surface appear as the ricci tensor of the solutions. the outer horizons are degenerate with zero mass and may be as small as a few k, depending on the value of the non - zero - mass term in the theory. when the outer region is compactified into a torus ( or a hyperboloid ), the outer regions become part of the solution along with the inner ones. in the case when the topology is simple, there exist torus - like regions within the solutions, and the inner regions are still in the shape of the outer ones. the behavior of the inner region is different from the one in the plus branch. in fact, the horizons appear to be superfluid even in the near - infrared when the ratio of the two major axes of the torus is zero. the outside regions are nearly spherical, and are the locus of global structures such as circles, columns, and diagonals in 3d and 4d. the major axis of the circle is the same in both the plus and the minus branches, and in both branches, the vacuum states have recently turned out to be stable.

we present large scale maps in co@xmath0 and @xmath1, obtained with the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory, respectively. the large maps provide a global view of the cloud, improving the analysis of existing observations, such as those of liseau et al. ( 1999 ) with iso and large scale subpolarimetric imaging spectroscopy ( pilis ). co emission is extended on large scales, similar to the molecular cloud, and is strongest in the region adjacent to exciting b2v star hd 147889. an adjacent ro - vibrational h=7 emission, cospatial with a western filamentary structure in the hot dust continuum at 7 & 15, provides evidence for a new foreground pdr. the distribution of all of the spectral lines reveals the presence of a significant population of condensations ( clumps ), whose relative abundances are inversely proportional to the cloud s baryon density. model fits to the line profiles yield estimates of the kinetic temperature ( b ), and of the structure of foreground absorbing co gas ( low - metallicity, high - column density, and large amplitude emitting regions ) ; the cloud is most highly embedded in a clumpy, plane - parallel slab of gas containing dense condensated ( clumpy ) gas, illuminated by an ultraviolet radiation field. the hco@math2 emission is seen to be coincident with both pah emission in the thermal ir and the filamentary dust structure seen with isocam at 7 and 15. we conclude that subthermal excitation can play a role in the photoionization of the molecular gas, at least in the regime of high b. the photo - ionization rate, implied by some observations, is high enough to contribute significantly to the excitation of denser molecular clumps, while the pdr density is low enough to serve as a threshold for condensation formation. we examine the future promise of high spectral and angular resolution observations of molecular lines, with particular emphasis on the potential for probing the poorly understood physical conditions and photodissociation properties of the @xcite oph cloud.
the _ euve _ deep survey ( ds ) photometer and _ asca _ x - ray observatory spectra of the polar v834 cen were recorded in 1993 may and 1999 february, respectively. light curves with a range of azimuth angles in the euv are presented. the mean 1993 and 1999 spectra can be fit by a blackbody model with a hydrogen column density of @xmath0, and by a pure - h stellar atmosphere model with the addition of a small ( 0.10.3)dex contribution. in the 1993 observation the signal - to - noise ratio was 107, and in the 1999 observation it was 82. accretion was primarily along the ballistic stream, resulting in a narrow eclipse of the small accretion spot on the white dwarf surface at the footpoints of the magnetic field lines. the primary eclipse is caused by the shift of the accretion rate along the stream, which is consistent with the proposed magnetic field strength of 23 mg. we suggest that in the two - spot model accretion is threaded by a narrow stream, extending down to an extent of 20@xmath1, whereas in the 2003 and 1999 observations the primary accretion occurs along the longer, more extended ballistic stream. a simple power - law model for the electric - resistivity distribution in the equatorial plane fits the data well, with a zero point energy release and a zero - point temperature decrease of 0.2 ev as a function of radius. within the 68 % contours the changes in the spectral shape are best explained by decreasing the effective temperature and increasing the magnetic flux, both of which can be done by increasing the inclination angle of the line - of - sight towards the star. the blackbody atmosphere model is unable to simultaneously explain the broad euv bandpass and the relatively small observed size of the spot, regardless of the assumed blackbody temperature. the same model fails to reproduce the observed phase - resolved spectra, indicating that a large range of column densities is required to explain the observed spectra. the hardening of the spectrum in the low states can be explained by the irradiation of a spot with a million - degree plasma content.
we present the results of a _ xmm - newton _ observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3998. the h@xmath0 line was clearly detected, and we find that the rest - frame equivalent width of the line is @xmath1 ev, in rough agreement with previous estimates. the x - ray spectrum is consistent with being dominated by a single unresolved source. this is in contrast to previous results from a previous analysis of the same data, which indicated that the source ( possibly supergiant or massive star ) was multiplexed and that the spectrum was dominated by inverse - compton scattering. to further constrain the accretion geometry we compare the observed sed with predictions of various accretion models. we do not find evidence for optically - thick material within the size of the disk ( as would be expected in a disk dominated by outflows ), but there is evidence that the outer edge is at least a few hundreds radii thick, suggesting that if this is the case, the inner edge must be at least several tens of radii in diameter. we can not rule out a source in the disk that is unabsorbed in the uv, however such an object would have to be very low in luminosity in order not to be detected in x - rays. we estimate the 0.1 - 100 kev luminosity from the non - detection of fe - k line emission, taking into account the possible line contribution from a starburst or agn. assuming a constant luminosity and a fixed velocity with an assumed virial temperature, the system can be characterized as having an accretion disk of about 500 schwarzschild radii, and a scale height of several hundred parsecs. these results are consistent with expectations from models of self - regulating accreting black holes.
we present the first comprehensive near - infrared ( nir ) photometric study of the ultracool binary 2mass j12095613@xmath11004008, previously identified as a t3.5+t5.5 mass - benchmark binary in the _ hubble space telescope _ and ground - based adaptive optics imaging surveys. the large ( @xmath12,000 ) separation between the two components is well - resolved and well - calibrated, allowing us to develop an independent test of current theoretical models of brown dwarfs based on both spectral fitting and dynamical mass determinations. as part of our ongoing program to study the multiplicity and physical properties of substellar binaries using laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs ao ), we present here the binarity of this system and use it to test the applicability of evolutionary and atmospheric models for t dwarfs. the high angular resolution of our photometry and, paired with the exceptionally precise photometry, allow us to unambiguously identify the primary component ( a ) and the secondary ( b ) in the h - r diagram. the photometric distance to the system is consistent with the photometry being at or near the solar neighborhood, while parallax measurements indicate that the distance is at least 1.6 kpc. from the integrated - light spectral energy distribution, we estimate the mass ratio of the primary and secondary components to be @xcite, placing the system in the vicinity of the region of the substellar / planetary boundary defined by the hydrogen - burning limit. the luminosities predicted by evolutionary models for this system are systematically underestimated by a factor of 23, similar in magnitude to the errors in the best - fit models for the l4+l4 substellar binary hd 130948bc. if the evolutionary models are correct, this would be one of the largest systematic errors ever encountered in the modeling of this type of system, potentially leading to an atypical mass ratio for a brown dwarf. the only other known extreme systems where such discrepancies are not resolved are the t3+t6 systems bab and m4+t8.5. a comparison of our nir spectra with those from wmap observations suggests that both systems lie along a single isochrone on the hertzsprung - russell diagram. both the astrometry and photometry independently indicate that this system is a true physical binary and that it is not a background object. we discuss the implications of these results for the nir spectral classification of
the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328 event can be understood as resulting from a hot accretion flow, driven into a previously quiescent supermassive black hole, which is subsequently collimated into two anti - parallel jets. little is known about the relation between jet production in the more massive accreting black holes and the state of their constituent accretion disks, however, both jets appear to be capable of producing directed flows of relativistic matter. here we discuss the evolution of jets triggered by tidal disruption in light of the twin requirements of super eddington luminosity and short flaring timescales. we present detailed hydrodynamical simulations of the tidal disruption of stars by a 1 @xmath0 black hole with the subsequent accretion of debris, including an adaptive mesh refinement scheme that permits the wide range of scales necessary to resolve the star and the debris streams simultaneously. we find that the viscosity and radiative cooling effects alter the character of the resulting light curve, especially in the jetted region. the afterglow light curve is influenced by the initial state of the jet but is ultimately determined by the properties of the debris and the surrounding medium. our formalism for calculating the rate of mass return to the black hole after the disruption, presented in this paper, is similar to the method presented in a previous paper, except for the initial conditions where we take the star to be a 1-@xmath1 star and evaluate the shock dissipation onto the decaying debris. the injected energy has a dramatic effect on the jet morphology, with the initially extended jetts having a torus - like structure in the optically thick region. once the innermost regions of the torus have been fully formed, the jet undergoes a period of intense flaring activity lasting for a month. the extent of violent activity is dramatically reduced when the surrounding region is treated as a homogeneous, optically thin medium. even in this initially highly chaotic environment, several possible transitions in the observable part of the light curve may be seen, although the distribution of mass does not appear to correlate with the duration of the flare. on the positive side, if and when we do see these transitions, they can be fairly constraining on the properties ( several orders of magnitude ) of the system.

we present a construction of a quantum tensor network analogous to a classical many - body network. using variational quantum monte carlo sampling, we update the ground state of an antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin model on a square lattice with realistic parameters based on the exact ground state wavefunction. the update is performed over a finite hilbert space of bond dimensions @xmath0 describing local degrees of freedom, and a virtual bond between two sites corresponding to a super site of the network. the super - site is coarse grained into a closed super - structure on a fine lattice of half the length, and the orientation of the lattice is assumed to be the same as the original one. the use of the spin - spin correlation at the longest distance breaks the su(2 ) symmetry, and we implement the tensor renormalization method, which was first proposed to contract classical tensor networks @xcite. the contraction is performed via a singular value decomposition and a resonating valence bond projection methods. in this work, we discuss how to update the tps wavefunction with an exact ground wavefunction for various bond dimensions by using the exact diagonalization method of approximate contraction. we present the algorithm, which can also be applied to extend the markov chain expansion procedure with local tensors to non - abelian gauge ( bg ) interaction. the algorithm is finally applied to the nearest neighbor spin model under the constraint of exact orthogonal symmetry. we observe that, at fixed bond dimension, the overlap of the original tensor evolution map for all bond dimensions is practically indistinguishable from its ground state ; however, for sufficiently large system sizes, there is a partial growth of the overlap for large bond dimensions. several examples are given to illustrate how database size and complexity of the problem can be used to study the evolution of a large number of interacting quantum systems, as well as the physics of various types of correlated phenomena, e.g. phase transitions and entanglement. quantum information processing, statistical mechanics, non - local symmetry breaking, tensorial approximation is an active field of research with applications to spintronics, quantum information storing and processing, nanotechnology, and large - scale quantum computation with symmetries in strong and weak coupling.
more than one hundred hot jupiters ( hjs ) are currently known around main sequence stars, but their origin is still controversially uncertain. although tidal effects are believed to be responsible for the existence of many of these hjs, it has been difficult to identify their origin. to address this problem we examine the formation scenario of hjs based on tidal trapping from quasi - parabolic orbits excited by lidov - kozai resonances with a binary stellar component. we use the same tidal and gravitational model as in beaug & nesvorn ( 2012 ), but employ the planet - planet scattering as the driving mechanism instead of the driving force. we consider a range of values for the tidal parameters and for the common characteristics of both the planet and its binary companion. we then compare the final orbital characteristics of observed hjs to the properties of the simulated planets and binaries. most of the planets are highly inclined and near - circular, while only a small portion of the hjs show the 3-day pile - up effect. the final hjs have highly inclined semimajor axes @xmath0 days and highly misaligned orbits with respect to the central star. these orbital characteristics are expected from disk - induced migration, and are in general consistent with those observed. however, large discrepancies between the results of the simulations and the observations can not be explained by inaccuracies in the model or the adopted tidal parameters. although most of our simulations were consistent with a smooth planetary migration, our results show that some hjs are also strongly misaligned with the stellar spin. to determine whether this is due to the migration mechanism or an effect of tidal interaction, we must apply larger and larger samples of tidal trapping experiments. we recommend focusing on the most recent model simulations, in which the resonance amplitude between the secondary star and planet is larger and the eccentricity of the planet is smaller than the observed value.

the degeneracy of two - phase microstructures is investigated using radial correlation functions as the only data available experimentally. the two - point correlation function @xmath0 is defined as the probability that two random points at a distance connected to one another both belong to the same microstructure. we focus on minimally degenerate systems, for which the degeneracy can be quantified via a random walk in configuration space, and derive an analytical expression for the energy landscape associated with the reconstruction. the approach is based on a general mc algorithm for estimating the density of states ( dos ) through a monte carlo method, which we have previously shown to be capable of producing unbiased reconstructions of physical systems with a given correlation function. examples of systems having a low degeneracy are selected from a library of 2-dimensional poisson polyhedra in euclidean space and 1-d random media in 3-dimensional space. using this method, we demonstrate that the desnanotropy of the energy landscapes is related to the roughness of the reconstructed energy landscape and we propose a universal roughness metric that can be used to characterize any shape parameter. we also derive a degeneracy metric for 2-dim systems and show that it is equivalent to the ` ` single - sphere degeneracy '' of a sphere at zero temperature. finally, we propose an analytical method to determine the ground state of a given microstructructure, which can in principle be solved analytically, using a standard finite - size discretizing grid. it is shown that, following hauptman and karle s approach, that a characteristic energy profile for the basin of each ground state can describe accurately the three - dimensional energy landscape of a physical system. psfig.tex # 1([#1 ] ) # 1#2#3#1, a&a, # 2, # 3. # 1@xmath1 # 1table [ # 1 ] # 1 = = = 1=1em.5ex-.77em.3ex-.15em t-.16em.25ex # 1to 0pt#1
we present a new mass and charge identification procedure which, as compared with other methods, considerably saves time without loss of precision. the accuracy of the proposed method is checked by comparing the mass distributions obtained with this procedure for original mass distributions in model - generated samples. we present the application of the method to data collected in a first experiments performed with the reverse collaboration at the forward part of the chimera apparatus. in addition, the results of the identification procedure are compared to those obtained with more conventional methods, through graphical cuts. * on the production of heavy ions in a dilute silicon detector, a very often used assumption is that the incident ion has a very small mass ( @xmath0 ), while the residual energy ( energy loss ) is linear in energy. this assumption is able to account for the large range of reaction mechanisms observed in the literature, from low to high energies. in experiments where the detector response is expected to be high ( e.g., slow oscillations or strongly pulsed signals ), an extension of the usual bethe - bloch formula is proposed, which takes care of all the above problems. a very efficient mass calculation is then performed prior to energy calibration. we find that, using our procedure, the calculated mass yields are in agreement within the statistical uncertainties. in the case of the adopted procedure, a quantitative _ reliability _ test can be performed by checking the partial contribution of the sampled mass and the total charge. * the distribution of the masses and the charge of the detected ions are shown to be in very good agreement with the results obtained with the more usual methods. in contrast, no agreement is found between the estimator and the observed masses and charge distributions. this suggests that some further work is needed to determine the respective statistical properties of the heavy - ion reaction mechanisms. in particular, for the evaluation of the average mass of the ions, some additional work is required to be done in order to reproduce the observed distributions. *
we present a detailed analysis of radio and x - ray observations of the active galaxy ngc1365. the radio data probe the hot thermal gas from starburst emission and the hard non - thermal radiation from any massive compact object. the observations on the other hand, allow us to probe the spectral properties of central regions and look for any extended emission ; the hri is less sensitive and has essentially no spectral resolution, but has good spatial resolution ( @xmath0 ) allowing a detailed study of the x- ray morphology. in particular, we report the results of _ australia telescope compact array _ ( atca ) and _ vla _ ( decs ) observations. the atca observations show that the seyfert nucleus has a complex morphology, with a complex structure of several morphologies. although it is evident that the active nucleus is heavily absorbed, we do not find any evidence for a heavily absorbed power - law or a single - temperature raymond - smith plasma model. we have, however, detected a weak soft excess of emission, which we consider to be related to the nuclear activity. the estimated total x-ray luminosity ( for the full disk or spherically symmetric array ) is @xfig.

we report the results of ga desorption measurements on the ( 0001 ) gan surface. during 1min of ga adsorption, we observe oscillatory transients in high - energy electron diffraction intensity during the growth process. we find that the duration of the transients is related to the amount of adsorbing or desorbing ga. based on a lattice - gas growth model based on _ ab initio _ calculated parameters, we attribute the observed transients to the ga surface coverage being modified by the presence of a surface contamination layer. a detailed analysis finds that for impinging ga fluxes @xmath0ml / s, there are three different regimes : ( 1 ) an s - shaped increase of the ga coverage during ga de - wetting, ( 2 ) a constant or increasing ga coverage up to a critical point ( i.e., at a fixed substrate temperature ), and ( 3 ) ga accumulation with no finite equilibrium ga coverages for a ga flux of higher than twice the equilibrium value. the different regimes are clearly distinguishable within the experimental precision of 1@xmath1. furthermore, the variation of the hi response shows that the total energy, including the activated energy due to the surface area, is not well - defined. this implies that the mechanism of ga accumulation does not depend on the substrate temperature. the discrepancy between the various regimes is greatly reduced if we assume that the growth rate is proportional to the number of nominally impinged ga. epsf.sty # 1#2#3#4#5#6#1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) versim#1#22.7ex.7ex gev mev ev kev tev m_z m_pl ^-1_w^2^w _ w _ w p_s^2_w p_r_w q_1,r_a^0 # 1,#2(#1 ) m_susy m_unif l l l * # 1*#2*#3^#4^#5_#6^#7_#8 # 10, _ phys. rev. _ * d * 93 ( 19#3 ) # 4 r.bernabei et al., ` ` optimal ga growth kinetics for nanostructured optoelectronic devices in the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions, '' j. opt. soc. am. b * 21 *,
we carefully consider the possibility of radiative amplification of neutrino mixing angles as an effect of the renormalization group running from high to low energy. in this context we examine the effects of non - renormalizable radiative corrections in the scenarios of the standard model and the minimal supersymmetric standard model. we consider scenarios in which not only mixing angles but also mass splittings agree with experiment at low energy, but only for the solar ( and atmospheric ) angles. we also investigate which scenarios require a fine - tuning in order to achieve the amplification, and describe in an intuitive way the main issues involved in the running ( appearance of infrared fixed points, interplay between the running of the angles and that of the fine - tunings, origin of the simultaneous tunings and etc. ). about the latter, we first study the two - flavour scenario, where all these features show up in the physical cases ( sm and mssm ), and then we apply the general theory to the unusual cases, in which the neutrinos are two quasi - degenerate ( and in some cases almost degenerate ) masses. for the latter we analytically calculate the coefficients of the running equations, and we show that in the small values of the relative importance of the solar and atmospheric mixings the rg effect is dominant and dominates the rg evolution, while the one - loop expansion is marginal or even absent. in the presence of a non - universal rg perturbation the rg effects become negligible. we finally discuss the general implications of these results for the oscillation spectrum of neutrinoless double @xmath0 decays. * possible mechanisms for + radiative + amplification of mixing angles in two flavours * kai schmitz@xmath1, tsutomu t. koschny@xs ) and yukawa ryuji honscheid@xs. _ _ + _ instituto de fsica corpuscular c.s.i.c./universitat de valncia + edificio de institutos de paterna, av. rovisco pais, p.le a.moro 5, 00185 - 970, rj, brazil _ * corresponding author : _ zhong - li liu + _ department of physics, saitama university, + shimo - okubo 255 - 8588, japan _ +
the intrinsic scatter in the near - infrared ( 2.2 @xmath0 ) fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies in the coma cluster is investigated using a sample of 48 objects located in the field of the great attractor region. these objects have been observed at the ukirt university k - band telescope using the ircam3 camera and ground - based telescopes using hubble space telescope / advanced camera for surveys ( cameras 2 ). the kinematics of these galaxies are investigated using v - k colours and mg@xmath8 line indices as well as velocity and absorption line indices. this allows us to probe the effects of stellar population ( i.e., age and metallicity ) effects on the stellar population relations in ellipticals in the distant universe. this is possible because of the close proximity of the two groups of galaxies and because the separation of their spectroscopic features is always smaller than in the optical. we find an rms scatter of 0.060 dex, similar to its optical counterpart. no difference is found in the coefficients and scatter of the ( v=0.20.8,0.05 ), ( v(1=1.6,1.9)@xfig.sty ) and ( v = 0).lines ( these scatter relations are similar to those derived at optical wavelengths and the intrinsic scatter is found to be 0.07 dex. this result is consistent with the prediction of the recent work by mobasher et al. ( 1986 ), who have used the observed relation in the infrared for a comparison of the strengths of the elliptical random variables. the difference in the slope of the observed ( rms ) relation and its intrinsic scatter ( including uncertainties in the estimated intrinsic scatter ) between the infrared and optical components of the relation indicates that changes in the stellar populations among the ellipticals are likely to be responsible for at least part of the scatter. the new distance indicator, based on the observed kinematical properties of ellipticals, is designed to take into account possible errors in the determination of the zero - point ( z=0 ) by using observations of galaxies at different environments. for the present data, an extinction corrected distance scale of -0.060.2 z / m / k is derived for each galaxy of the sample. this scale is in excellent agreement with the observed one. however, we find a slight shallower slope than that predicted by bruzual and charlot ( 1996 ) for the single - element relation at a fixed z = 0 and hence
we present a microscopic theory for the suppression of superconductivity in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. the microscopic theory is based on the microscopic derivation of the ginzburg - landau equations by gorkov, but the local - limit result of bcs is treated as a weak perturbation. we expect the theory to be valid for highly - local superconductors, in which case the effect of spin paramagnetism is negligible. as examples, we present the results for weak magnetic fields, and determine, in each case, spatial variations of important electronic quantities. for example, we show that free energy density @xmath0 is a non - monotonic decreasing function of temperature @xfig.@xcite, applied magnetic fields. we calculate the magnetization and magnetic field penetration depth for a superconductor with a semi - infinite film on the surface. we also calculate the magnetic field polarization and propose a criterion for the prediction of a zero knight shift in the superconducting state. we find that the theory is valid for weak fields and high temperatures. in the high - field limit, we make the prediction that, for a not - so - weak magnetic field, the ratio of the perpendicular magnetic field to the perpendicular one is unity. the theory also allows, for the first time, calculation of microscopic meissner effects for both correlated electrons and free electrons. the results are valid for correlated electrons with non - zero spin - polarization ( i.e., for temperatures just below superconductive cooling transition ). for free electrons, the results include the microscopic calculation of mean free energy, and, in the limit of very small field strengths, of the energy gap function. the field - gap functions are also determined analytically. in this paper, we use the same bcs theory that was previously developed for the calculation of energy gap functions for electrons and heisenberg - like particles. we modify the calculations of these quantities in order to include the effects of spin - paramagnetic fluctuations.
we present a systematic method to obtain a broadband stimulated - brillouin - scattering ( sbs)-based gain spectrum with direct current modulation. we show that a rectangular - topped sbs gain profile is the best candidate to minimize the effect of the thermal chirp and thus achieve improved delay performance for the broadband sbs slow light system. by controlling the distribution of the current, we are able to tunably tailor the spectral profile that optimizes the slow - light performance under constraints of pulse distortion and pump power. 99 l. mandel and e. wolf, _ optical coherence and quantum optics _ ( cambridge university press, 1999 ). k. m. hoang, r. l. schienberger, c. e. chou, t. j. kippenberg, and k.m. j. vahala, ` ` 4-gb / s sbs monochromatic gaussian - mode fiber system, '' ieee photon.. lett. * 8*(3 ), 140 - 150 ( 2000 ). m. d. eisaman, y. yi, s. ahmed, m. h. albrow, and s. r. windeler,`` broadband coherent optical system with full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) and broadband linewidth modulation, '' opt. express * 20*(6 ), 1172 - 1176 ( 2007 ). f. grosshans,@xmath0350, p. krger, v. hndchen, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, and a. v. sergienko,``a new approach to femtosecond optical pulse generation, '' j. lightwave technol. * 24*(11 ), 1595 - 1597 ( 2006 ). y. wang, b. cheng, x. li, and x. zhang,``radio frequency broadening of semiconductor transmission lines in an optical fiber system i.e., broadband superluminal capacity and spectral shift, '' appl. opt. * 46*(7 ), 850802 - 8509 ( 2005 ). h. s. eisenstein and c. t. eberly,``high - speed dispersive optical parametric oscillation in fiber - based slow light systems, '' anal. optics * 77*(5 ), 13671369 ( 2004 ). s. tanzilli, w
we study the asymptotic decay of brownian particles from euclidean cones onto @xmath0. using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, we prove that the expected capture time of a brownian particle moving on a particular sphere is infinite. in the process, we obtain new upper bounds on the time it takes for a blackbody to depart from an equatorial domain of this form, and we give several applications, including the computation of the escape rate of probabalistic heat, the upper bound on the diffusion length of a charged particle from a certain primordial insulator, and a proof of the brownian exit theorem for spin perturbations of frii particles. the study of the eigenvalues of eigenfunctions of spherical domains was started by peter deblassie in @xcite. in this paper, we revisit this problem, using new tools from dynamical systems theory. suppose we are given a _ double _ dirichlet eigenfunction on a complex plane, whose real plane is to the left of the equatorial plane, which enumerates the vertices of a regular tesselator one obtains by connecting the vertex faces of regular torsion - symmetric complexes with great circle arcs. consider the domains in question. suppose the domains are piecewise regular, have regular structure, and satisfy an exterior cone condition, and are approximated by a finite - volume approximation in terms of hausdorff distance. we consider two different types of separation of variables. first, we use the rayleigh characterization of the first eigenvalue to estimate the expected of a domain, which is a consequence of a conjecture by souto ribeiro and biringer. in particular care is taken of the choice of congruent domains. for instance, one can use the formula given by equation ( [ main - thm ] ) to determine the expected_absent_evaporation_rates _ of a double _ domain _ if it has a positive separation constant. then one can explicitly consider domains which are not physical. for example, consider _ nice _ domains. these are domains defined on the equator, and have a conical structure ( we will refer to them as such in the following ). more precisely, we can consider _ lerose _ domains, which are nice in the sense that they have a small regularity and satisfy a condition of relative regularity according to the schur formula : if a measurement of the completion of the perturbation is
we present an analysis of epidemic dynamics in the scale - invariant single social contact ( sir ) model. this model has been used to study outbreak of influenza in hong kong in the first 15 days. a discrete model is adapted from the original sir model and applied to predict the evolution of epidemic. it exhibits a new transmission mode that differs from the intimate contact route observed in the early stage. we name this new mode @xmath0 growth. it is parameterized by two parameters : the infection coefficient and the removal rate from the population. we compare the control behaviour of this model with the observed epidemic data and determine whether the epidemic is under control or not. the estimated control level is compared with the true epidemic data for different countries and areas and it is found that it is possible to achieve a better control level by taking into account the true variation in the control strategy and individual behaviour. * increasing public health costs and response to epidemic outbreaks require appropriate measures of protection for public health systems. increasing the availability of medical facilities provides more and more resources to prevent infectious diseases like influenza from spreading and the associated costs associated with them. however, it is difficult to design effective control policies to effectively supervise the disease spreading. information on the efficacy of epidemic control is of greater strategic significance for the public health system as it will help to determine whether to apply more control policies and to balance cost and benefit from them. * * how to effectively control an epidemic epidemic * * w.m. daley@xmath1, g.c. weinberg@xcite, * * epidemiology professor emeritus professor emergent sciences division, national institute for studies in epidemiology, university of wales, ul. kopernika, 30, 30 - 059 cracow, poland, * keywords : * epidemic models, small - world, social network, internet, coronavirus * corresponding author. e - mail address : daley1@network.nig.ac.uk * * affiliation : * dipartimento di fisica, universit sapienza, univ. di roma ` ` santiago '', i-00133 rome, italy, + phone number : + 077 - 0013 080 57414 - 5969, fax number 039 - 574 - 6859, + 0.1 in * msc2010 mathematics division, king s college london, south kensington campus, london sw7 2az, uk ;
in this paper we prove that any @xmath0-dimensional stacked polytope can be reduced to a simplex, i.e. a stacked sphere. the simplex is a random connected manifold and the stacked sphere is a simplicial complex. in both cases khnel showed that a stack of facets is a _ stacked sphere _ if and only if it contains at most two stacks. the key notion of a stack is that the set of facets created by the last subdivision of the stack is a single stack. thus, if the top of every stack is stacked, then there is at most one stack. furthermore, we show that an infinite stack can be obtained from a single triangulation by hand addition, where the first and second stack are the original vertices of the second stack and the last one is a new vertex. while the first stack is always a stack, the second and third stacks are always two. in fact, the fourth stack is the intersection of two intersecting single - stacked polytopes. the main result of this paper is : [ 1stack ] if any ( stacked ) sphere is so flat that the first two stacks are two stacks, then the whole space is then one and the same as the first ( stacked sphere ) stack. the structure of the proofs and the proof of the theorem are very similar to those of e. spentackerstaff @xcite and h. spends a considerable amount of time studying the relationship between lie algebras and triangulations of manifolds, and it is natural to extend the analysis to the case of stacked spheres. the game of deciding whether a manifold is _ stacked _ or _ lie flat is a game in which one replaces every vertex by another one. this is exactly khnel s generalization of csszr s torus. for closed manifolds the situation is more complicated as one considers manifolds of opposite orientation. however, once the topology of a manifold has been determined, the geometry of the vertices can be very simple. for example, a manifold can be defined by the following action : lift and lift and then repeatedly repeat the identifying facets of its vertices. the orbit of a face is completely determined by the geometric realization of the face. we will focus on the case where the facet is non - orientable. we call _ face - polynomial _ of the target manifold a _ miss _ and will return to it in the next section. in this article we are interested in determining if a certain important class of manif
one of the more intriguing phenomena in computational algebraic geometry is the qualitative behavior of local zero - point zero or qualitative properties of germs. in two variables the normalset and the associated matrix elements are called _ germs_. in the presence of smooth changes the number of solutions may or may not be simplified to be simplified. such behavior is called a _ bifurcation_. we describe how to recognize whether or not a given singular germ is a normal form for a different normal form computations subject to certain perturbations. in this report, we present the command ` ` universalunfolding ` which gives a list of possible normal forms for singular germ. further, the familiar symbol ` ` recognitionproblem ` ` denotes the recognition problem for a singular germ with a minimal list of monomial terms in its taylor expansion. the problem is solved by means of a mathematical model called singularity. singularity is a mathematical modeling tool that has been used to deal with many problems in a wide range of scientific fields. + the following commands are provided, if the following information is provided, you may use them to circumvent the problem of choosing the appropriate computational ring for normal form analysis of the germ. the options are : * the default is fractional germ ring. the normal form of a parametric germ is usually a parameterized normal form. each germ in the parameter space is either the _ ring of fractional germs _ or the ring of smooth germs * and the choices of computational ring can be made to be _ non - persistent _, that is, the germ may be of infinite codimension one for a subset of parameter values equal to a fixed number @xmath0. the command accordingly returns a permissible truncation degree, normal form and non - normal for computations involving the input germ. * the program is easy to learn and use, and the commands are reasonably well suited for learning about the theory of singularity in the context. + this user guide provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of these commands and how they work, as well as a general command to familiarize the commands with laboratory laboratory data.
we report the discovery of a new circular shell around an evolved, massive blue variable ( wr ) star in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) identified through detection of a circular clump at @xmath03.6 m with _ spitzer_. the circular structure, inferred from millimeter continuum and far - ir imaging with _ herschel _ and _ wise _, is similar to that found for several other wr stars in the lmc. it is located in a region of parsecs in projection around two already known massive b - type wn3 stars and a b0v star. the central star of the new shell has a stellar parameters that are consistent with those of an o - type star, indicating that it is a massive binary system. we analyse the spectral properties of the star and its associated shell using long - slit spectroscopic observations with the gemini south and du pont 2.5-m telescopes, as well as with the salt observatory ( nuker et al. 2006 ) and the south african large telescope ( salt ), in order to determine the physical parameters of the shell, assumed to consist of mostly interstellar matter. the abundances of he i, c, n and o are almost identical to those of the local interstellar medium, confirming that the shell is composed of mostly of atoms. a detailed analysis of the ionization and photoionization conditions of the circumstellar material shows that he ii is overabundant with respect to other ions, posing a challenge to theoretical models. in particular to the he i model, the circular shell can be modeled with a two - component atomic hydrogen envelope, one component being fully ionized by o and the other one with a partial opacity of [ oiii]@xmath15.5. the abundance pattern of he ii could be explained by a superposition of these two models. we also analyse the relationship between the shell and its newly discovered central star, calling for a luminous blue variable companion or a second - generation binary, and find that the ionized plasma is in good agreement with photometric and evolutionary status.

we present the first diffraction - limited optical microscopy study of spatial correlations of speckle intensity patterns produced in the diffraction range from the near field to the far field. we perform multiple scattering experiments on two different samples of three - dimensional disordered materials, consisting of @xmath0 spheres of silica, in contact with a thermal absorbing medium at sub-@xmath1k. we observe a clear transition from a near - field to a far - field behavior, which we model using a mean - field theory based on the multiple scattering theory of he - ne laser transmission through the sample. our experiments are confirmed by the observation of a gradual decrease of the grain size with the distance from the sample, as the intensity intensity distribution increases. this behavior is interpreted in terms of a divergent internal structure of the medium, and we present a simple model which correctly predicts the transition between different regimes. 99 l. mandel and e. wolf, _ optical coherence and quantum optics _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 1995 ). a. a. malygin, a. n. penin, and a. v. sergienko, ` ` theory of the photomultiplier effect in a two - dimensional dielectric medium, '' phys. rev. lett. * 69 *, 25932596 ( 1990 ). d. c. eckle, ( 1970 ). m. w. mitchell, s. p. gratton, and j. s. j. smith, _ surface scattering and diffraction in solids _ ( university science books, 1986 ). p. r. hemmerich, d. d. childress, m. aspelmeyer, and d. l. menegozzi, _ advances in optical micro - microscopy _ ( springer, new york city, 2006 ). e. nagali, f. de martini, l. marrucci, p. di caprio, g. manzoor, r. ramponi, and m. f. santopinto, _ introduction to micro - optomechanics _ ( imperial college press, london, 2012 ), 2nd ed. l. martn - gabet, r.- p. patrizii, c. m. barbosa, and p. bianchi, _ dipartimento di fisica delluniversit di torino, padua, italy _
we present @xmath0-band images of the central regions of 67 early - type galaxies obtained with the wfpc2 aboard the hubble space telescope. this sample roughly doubles the number of galaxies that have now been imaged at similar resolution with hst. in the isophotal analysis of the images we find that the brightest galaxies tend to have boxy isophotes, are pressure supported, and often show some form of radio and/or x - ray activity. on the other hand, the faintest galaxies exhibit a variety of structures in the central region, such as filaments, sheets, and filaments. the luminosity profiles along the major and minor axes are well approximated by nuker - law profiles. we find a small fraction of galaxies ( 16 out of 67 ) that have central cusps that have a continuously changing slope, rather than a double power - law shape with a clear break radius. for these systems the central cusp slope is smaller than the value measured in the outer galaxy, but it is difficult to determine an accurate value because the slope of the cusp is very sensitive to the sub - pixel resolution of the image. we also find a very small number ( 3 out of 68 ) of galaxies for which the absolute magnitude of the brightest galaxy is significantly larger than the magnitude of its luminosity profile. these galaxies are virtually all core galaxies, devoid of any evidence of a nuclear disk, or of a significant amount of dust. in fact, it is nearly impossible to find any sign of any central agn activity. these results are consistent with the idea that ` nucleation'in core ( and intermediate ) galaxies is associated with an active galactic nucleus, while it is unclear whether core galaxies are the progenitors of black holes that sink to the center and excavate the core ; or whether the cores of massive black holes are the precursors of the galactic nuclei. we have also determined the fraction of radio galaxies, spiral galaxies, and irregulars that show evidence of nuclear activity. although the black hole mass and bulge mass appear to correlate with luminosity, the data are still too sparse to draw strong conclusions about the relationship between these two quantities.
we present deep, very large telescope ( vlt ) nir images in the hei 1.08@xmath0 m, [ feii ] 1.64 @xmath1 1.064 r - band and nir spectra of the starburst galaxy ngc 1569 in the k band taken with the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) mounted on the high resolution imaging utility unit for extragalactic research ( lucifer ), and use them to construct the two - dimensional spatial distribution of interstellar extinction and star formation rate density on scales of 2 pc in order to study the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ), the stellar population responsible for ionizing the h and he lines, and the reddening along the major axis of the galaxy. the high accuracy of the spatial map of dust extinction due to the central cavities and the photometric dereddening from the central region to the south - west is reproduced by a model in which a ring, containing two super - star clusters, one around the central cusp of the ism and one located near the outer ism, is observed to extend in a plane approximately perpendicular to the galaxy major axis. the ring is clearly asymmetric with a scale length of about 0.4 pc and has an average ratio of -0.8 - 0.8 mag. the total mass of the most recent supernova burst is derived as 0.15 - 0r_1.2 m@xsmath2/acs. from the color excess ratios of the [ fe ii]1.64/[feii]=1.20 and 1.88/acs lines, as well within the angular scale of the vlt, we estimate an age and total mass consistent with a burst with an age of 0.3 - 1 gyr and a comoving mass of 1.2 - 1.1 @xiffert ( depending on the assumed reddening model ). the observed values of the ionizing x - ray flux ratio suggest that a significant fraction of the local ism ionizing photons have been absorbed by the expanding expanding ring in the past. the amount of iron that was ionized is found to increase linearly with the radius from the center to about 15 to 30 pc from the galaxy center, with the three major peaks coinciding with the maxima in the radial profiles of the hydrogen and helium lines. this indicates that star formation has been quenched some 10 gyr ago, and that the intervention of a galactic outflow
the greatest mystery about cooling flows is the nature of the ultimate repository of the gas seen to cool through the x - ray band. if cooling flows are long lived phenomena, then the total amount of cooled gas is roughly @xmath0@xmath1 k. however, it is possible that some other mechanism, e.g., turbulence, does not allow the gas to cool to lower temperatures, and if this is the case, the total cooling rate is likely to be higher than the sum of the cooling rates of the various regions of the cluster. in other words, the cooling is most likely to occur in the inner regions, where the temperature differences between the cooling lumps are large. in this paper, i discuss ideas ways to determine the density and temperature structure in the cooling flow gas in clusters. one idea is to measure the radial inflow associated with the cooling. that idea could be used to constrain the density fluctuations in the general intracluster gas. another idea would be to detect the low ionization absorption lines associated with cooling flows, and then use those lines to investigate the structure of the intergalactic medium. however, neither of these methods have yet been successful in doing this, partly because of the long travel times involved. in any case, it would be interesting to compare the fluxes of the low and high ionization lines from cooling flows to determine if there is any systematic difference in the rate of cooling in the two sets of data. i summarize the current status of these investigations, and outline potential future developments. cluster cooling flows i have recently discovered that many clusters have large amounts of hot, dense and dense gas bubbling away from their centers. the hot gas has the capability of providing the most direct evidence for cooling because it is spatially uniform in temperature and density. the dense gas is well - mixed. most of the cooled gas comes from the central kpc region, where there is a large amount of time to cool before the gas reaches the center of the flow. cooling is rather slow, because the density decreases very quickly with radius. as a result, the time to cooling can not be fast. the surface brightness profiles of most cooling flow clusters are very peaked to the center, but not as fast as expected if the gas were homogeneous. also, the distribution of densities and temperatures at the outer edge of a cooling flow can be very different from that of the density at the center : densities are larger in the outer radii, and temperatures are higher in the center. eps
we analyze archival _ chandra _ data of the central region of the star cluster 30 doradus. we confirm the detection of the two x - ray point sources, which were previously found by wang & helfand ( 1991 ). in addition, we find 18 new sources, of which 13 are likely to be wn wolf - rayet stars. one of these sources is probably a blend of several wn stars in the sub - cluster r136. we argue that the x - rays produced by these systems originates from colliding wind systems. the luminosities of these systems have changed significantly over the years since their discovery, being up to 0.5 times higher in the center of r136 ( @xmath0pc ) than in the milky way ( 3.5 kpc ). two of the sources in r136 are extended and are probably associated with the clusters r140 and r136b, although it may be too early to determine the fate of these objects. we study the properties of the dense late type stellar population and find that it is not possible to constrain the age of the stars from the present analysis. on the other hand, comparing the star clusters r136 and r140, we conclude that the stars in these clusters have ages that differ by at least 2myr, most likely due to the differences in the initial masses of their stellar populations. we also study the nature of the source populations and conclude that they are probably normal stars with stellar masses similar to those in the lmc and other clusters of the magellanic clouds. we find that the most luminous star ( 120 ) are located in a compact position in the cluster central region. however, we do not find any evidence for the presence of a black hole in the most massive star, although a dozen stars with spectral types o3 and earlier are located within 10@xmath1 of the cluster center. the lack of black holes indicates that the clusters do not contain a mass black hole, but a neutron star or some other compact object.
we study the evolution of a complex network during its evolution from a scale - free sub - graph to the scale - invariant hierarchical structure of the canonical minimal spanning tree ( mst ), before and after the recent worldwide financial crash. using empirically generated, time - dependent, correlation based causal networks, we examine the dynamics of evolving mst network in equilibrium and during the time - step transition from the equilibrium to the non - equilibrium regime, characterized by the @xmath0-transition of the vertex degrees. for the equilibrium state, we observe the familiar condensation phenomenon, where a preceeding phase of nucleation growth of vertices is preceded by a truncated phase of condensation of the edges, which can be regarded as a precursor of the large - scale market crash. we theoretically envisage a scenario for the condensation in which the superhub ( superhub ) forms a temporal condensate on a real - life financial market. the main goal of the work is to show, that an occupation layer ( mol ) can play the role of a temporal short - range order parameter, sufficiently sensitive to describe the local dynamics in the mst evolving structure, and that a distinct absolute minimum of this mol can be considered as a potentially important threshold for the onset of a crash. previously, we had observed, in a diachronic approach to condensation, complementary to the methods considered by albert - barabsi ( and refs. therein ), that the local minima of the order parameters involved in the dynamics are defined as the minimum of a discrete kinetic equation of the markovian type. in this work we show that the discrete kinetic equations, and hence power law distributions of vertex degrees, also called as the ` mst power law ', play a sufficiently important role to include in the discretization process involved. we foresee that our results, containing universal aspects complementary in nature to those in ref. @xcite, will have a significant impact to the modeling of dynamic structural and topological phase transitions and critical phenomena on financial markets. * keywords : * complex networks, undirected, canonical minimization, mst, scale invariant, random networks, nucleation, bose - einstein condensation
we construct a low - energy model for the interatomic magnetic interactions in the titanium perovskite @xmath1tio@xmath2. we discuss the interplay of the crystal distortion and the superexchange ( se ) interactions. in particular, we compare the results of this model with the ones obtained in the hartree - fock approximation for the same compound. we also present details of the parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian. the magnetic moments in the ground state and the values of the magnetic transition temperature in the mean - field approximation are summarized in table [ tab : sogs ]. the crystal structure obtained for ytoto@ktsi is consistent with the results found in the first - principles electronic structure calculations. moreover, we find that the resonant ferromagnetic ( fm ) transitions occur in the site - localized excitations of the se interactions, which supports the fm nature of the observed ground state. in view of these results, we discuss how the weak - coupling afm phases may be understood in terms of the combination of the many - electron effect in the bonds and the relativistic one - electron interaction. in this context, we argue that the afm phase is driven by the distortion - controlled crystal - field ( cf ) splitting. however, we also show that the cf splitting is rather small in the rt structure compared with the one in the lt compound. thus, the ground - state fm phase may be controlled by the crystal field rather than by the type of afm. finally, we show that, in the magnetic ground state, there are longitudinal correlations of the orbital degrees of freedom between the spins. in the local coordinate frame, these seem to be caused by the 1-correlated antiferromagnetic correlations in the so - called hoppings. the correlation distances are rather large in comparison with the typical size of ensembles of compounds in the heavy - fermion regime. we see therefore the possibility of designing tailor - made magnetic materials in the future.
we present an homogeneous and updated set of stellar evolution models and isochrones for old-, intermediate- and young stellar populations for a wide range of chemical compositions. two large grids, with and without the inclusion of convective core overshooting during the h - burning phase are provided. this set of theoretical models is suitable for population synthesis analysis as well as for investigating evolutionary properties of field and cluster stars in a wide reported range of masses and chemical compositions ( see, e.g., spinrad et al. 2000 ). our models have been computed making use of many of the most recent updates of stellar physics. in particular, we have employed new electron conduction opacities that cover the relevant physical conditions of electron degenerate cores along the red giant branch ( rgb ) ; new homogeneous reaction rates from the nacre compilation, plus the latest determination for the important @xmath0c@xmath1 reaction ; new eos that covers homogeneously all the stellar structure for the entire mass range covered by our computations. the adopted initial he abundance for metal - poor models is consistent with the results obtained by globular cluster analysis and by chemical composition studies in galactic globular clusters. the models are then coupled to a new set of color - transformation and bolometric corrections. the availability of independent sets of models, computed with the best possible choices of the well established physics, and with various choices for the parameters describing the physical processes not yet well understood, allows us to assess the impact of different efficiency of mass loss on various properties of simple and composite stellar populations. it is found that our models agree very well with the empirical constraints derived by salaris & cassis ( 1997 ). we have also updated the he core mass and the synthetic morphologies of various stellar populations in order to produce comparisons with simple observational constraints in the sense that they are directly connected to the actual properties of the core. the updated models are supplemented by several empirical studies, discussed in the work by caballero - maza & francesco ( 1998 ).

we present detailed calculations of the heating and dynamical evolution of hot gas in galaxy groups and clusters in a flat @xmath0cdm universe. the gas is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium in a growing nfw dark halo where gas is heated externally by type ii supernovae at high redshifts, and internally by agn or other agents at early times, consistent with the self - similar behavior of groups in arnaud - evrard and allen - fabian clusters. the pre - heating controversy devolves on a choice between _ internal _ supernova heating during galaxy group formation and _ universal _ ( universal ) heating at an early time. we show that the entropy of gas in groups is generally very similar to that in rich clusters if the universe is treated as a flat einstein - de sitter cosmology, but far less centrally concentrated and starless than in the case of rich clusters. in contrast, groups with strong cooling flows have the lowest gas temperatures and diffusely distributed temperatures and their x - ray luminosities are not concentrated in ( group ) halos as assumed in previous studies. our models account for the present day radial variation of density, temperature and iron abundance of gas observed in the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 4472. the long term evolution of this gas is consistent with that seen in other studies if the nfw is instead a superposition of two stable nfw systems a nfw with adiabatic inflow and radiative cooling. we also find that models with a reset of the gas entropy at a high redshift may be unable to achieve high enough temperatures and viscous velocities to explain the observed entropy variation. however, models with mild additional heating of the intergalactic medium that result in hydrostatically supported gas at low densities and moderate temperatures provide good fits to the data. our results are in good agreement with the predictions of a scenario in which massive and luminous galaxy groups experience externally generated ( type ii ) supernova ` ` bumps '' during their formation. in this scenario, the initial gas mass of the bulge of the central galaxy is reduced and the subsequent growth of the cluster gas and stars is followed by a long period of star formation and supernova explosions. # 1to 0pt#1 accepted for publication in the astrophysical journal.
we use 1-d press - schechter simulations to study the clustering properties of dark matter haloes in the reionizing universe. haloes are formed from fluctuations in the matter density field characterized by the matter power spectrum. in contrast to previous studies of halo clustering, we are able to measure the large - scale bias ( i.e. bias excess ) of haloes that have masses capable of forming stars and galaxies. moreover, unlike other studies, our comparison with other studies at lower redshifts includes virtually all haloes large enough to form stars or galaxies at redshift 30. we find that while the halo bias is approximately universal at the @xmath0 level for mass and redshift, it becomes weak and independent of the volume of the simulation, suggesting that finite volume effects are small for massive haloes and faintest haloes, which could potentially probe cosmology and the physics of high redshift galaxy formation. when considered in conjunction with the redshifted galaxy halo luminosity function, our study demonstrates the possibility of using luminosity weighted haloes as probes of the population of sources of high - redshift galaxies. the pairwise velocity dispersion of both mass and haloes is quantified and the relative biases in the two quantities are discussed. our results can be used as part of a comprehensive study of how the number density of galaxies in clusters scales with the luminosity of the host halo. in addition, our results indicate that if a given halo occupies the centre of the imf, then its clustering strength will be sensitive to the local halo volume, which in turn will be used to constrain the cosmological parameters of the galaxy formation process. finally, we emphasize that by considering halo kinematics, one can get a much better measure of both the matter and halo power spectra at the same time.
we compute the probability that an image of a high - redshift source is subject to a microlensing optical depth @xmath0 due to stars or compact objects in the dark halos of galaxies. near the lines of sight to strongly microlensed sources, we investigate the frequency of microlenses as a function of redshift, source optical depth, and stellar and galactic halo mass - to - light ratio. the calculations assume a universe populated by isolated ( meaning no more than one lensing galaxy along any line of sight ) elliptical and spiral galaxies having luminosities that are distributed according to schechter functions with central velocity dispersions that are described by the de vaucouleurs profile. probability distributions are computed for both the stellar populations of galaxies and for halos composed of randomly distributed objects. for stars multiply - imaged by elliptical galaxies the resulting microlense rate for high redshift sources is around 1 10th of 1 percent, comparable to that for sources at redshift 3.0. the fraction of sources that are automatically microlens by ellipticals is only around 1 percent. for galaxies composed of compact objects we find that in agreement with previous results that have been based on the assumption that cdm halos are composed of infinitely many identical objects, but are not inapplicable due to the failure of lensing of large scale structure down to scales of a few kpc. limits on the density of randomly located compact objects have been placed on the halo masses corresponding to the following assumptions : ( i ) the density profile of dark matter is spherically symmetric, ( ii ) compact objects constitute the total mass of the universe, and ( iii ) the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion of galaxies is not more than a few tenths of a percent. under these assumptions, we show that in the limit of no scatter in the optical depth ( or surface brightness ) of a source, the probability of a beam from a singly imaged source not passing through a microlanning optical depth larger than @xiff0 ( i.e. the ratio of the optical depths of stars and compact objects ) is one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of stars, decreasing from large values to zero as the scale of the source redshift is decreased. the probability varies from 0.1 percent for sources with smooth optical depths ( without scatter ) up to more than 1 percent for those with statistically significant scatter ( but with a tail extending to very large values ). microl
d stars are likely progenitors of type ia supernovae. i will refer to them as dds since they are the dominant source of low frequency gravitational waves in the galaxy. the best known system, kpd 0422 + 5421, has a mass of @xmath0. other dds, such as gd 448, may also have masses well above the chandrasekhar limit. there are however only a few examples of dds with both masses and orbital periods. i argue that observational selection is to blame ; in particular there are several white dwarf binaries without clear evidence for close binaries, and few m dwarf binaries with clear signs of close binaries. the dds should all be rare, and could be created from the remnants of algols ; such ` ` single - degenerate '' systems are predicted in the 2-dimensional distribution of main - sequence stars. i suggest that dds are more likely to produce colliding neutron stars than colliding black holes. this is supported by evolutionary models which show that ( a ) very low mass white dwarfs can remain inside their roche lobe even past the agb ; and ( b ) the long period systems may well be lurking amongst them. address = blackett laboratory, imperial college london, south kensington campus, london sw7 2az, uk address = department of physics and astronomy, university of southampton, southampton so17 1bj, dorking, surrey, rh5 6nt, ucwww.iastate.ac.uk address = centre de recherche astrophysique de dauphine, cea saclay, 91191, france, and centre for astrophysics research, liverpool, southern belfast, wc2a 3g1, ua * pacs codes : 98.62.aj, 98.70.vc stars : binaries : close stars : wolf, cataclysmic variables stars : fundamental parameters
a damped ly @xmath0 ( dla ) system toward the bl lac object ao 0235 + 164 was observed with the hst / stis instrument in february, 1998. simultaneous asca and rosat x ray data are used to determine the metallicity in this system based on a composite spectrum from the two lines of sight. the results from spectroscopic and interferometric followup are in line with previous results from the literature. the dla absorption system is selected on the basis of its redshift and possible strong galactic type 2175 feature. the ratio of the optical to uv flux densities indicates that galactic type dust is present and that the extinction curve can be described by a galactic - type extinction law with two uv points and a far uv point. a comparison of the observed absorption line ratios to those predicted by the galactic extinction model shows good agreement at the 1.4-@xmath2 level. this result suggests that dust is important in dla systems, and that it is relatively rare in systems more distant than 10 kpc. one possible explanation for the relatively shallow dust feature is that a dust particle propagating in the vicinities of the galaxies was pinched by the strong background emission. this pinning may have left the effect of the pinning unresolved. a more likely explanation is that the particle propagates in a correlated fashion with the ionization temperature of the gas and at this time the chemical abundances of the ions including the corundum are depleted by only a small amount relative to the metal abundances. we also report on a keck lris spectrum obtained in may 1995. the spectrum shows structure in the 7000 to 9000 range due to less than perfect fringe correction and residuals from atmospheric absorption bands at about 6900 and 7600. the galaxy may be a quasar viewed through dust lenses.
this talk will be a short review of the status of the calculation of total cross - sections using a qcd driven mini - jet model, with particular emphasis on recent measurements and results of theoretical calculations of @xmath0 cross - states. the calculation is based on the eikonal minijet model, and we use it to describe the partonic matter distribution inside the hadrons through a function inspired by the pion electromagnetic form factor. the transverse momentum distribution of the partons in the colliding hadrons is treated through an s - dependent b - distribution, leading to a total hadronic cross - section which exhibits a rising slope for infrared photoproduction. we calculate the proton form factor using a brodie - hundertmarkt - eckart form factor, and then extrapolate the process to infrared photons, taking into account relevant cosmological uncertainties. we present our predictions for the hadronic content of the resolved virtual photon, and discuss its possible extension to real and virtual photons. we point out that for the virtual photon description, the scale factor is the same as for the real photon except that the intrinsic transverse - momentum anstz is complemented with a factor inspired by extended vector meson dominance. we also discuss possible extensions of the model in the context of aspen@xcite. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 043issn 0418 - 9833 + march 2010 * total cross sections for proton and proton - antiproton collisions * + _ submitted to eur. phys. j. _ c _ * pacs _ _ * # 1 * _ # 2 r. abe@xmath1, h. a. m. mcclelland @xcite _ _ + _ accepted for publication in _ european physics journal _ ( # 1, # 2 ) _ + # 1*p : hep - ph/#1 * _ m.- l. zhang + _ has theqi institute of theoretical physics, + institute of high energy physics, chinese academy of sciences, + p.o. box 2735, beijing 100049, people s republic of china + _ external address : _ desy school of science, massachusetts institute of technology, cambridge, ma 02138, usa + _ email : _ rxxu@massachusetts.edu.au + _ affiliation : _ department of physics, cern
we study the stability of @xmath0-modes in pulsars within the scenario, where the one - nucleon reactions ( du ) are suppressed in the majority of neutron stars up to experimentally measured values, but the pion mode softening is enhanced in some cases. the goldstone mode contribution to the shear viscosity in superfluid neutron star matter induced by phonon - phonon interactions is calculated. we find that for sufficiently high values of the eos parameters, the condensates of bosonic excitations carrying a nonzero momentum can appear in some regions of the neutron star provided that the corresponding excitation energy is rather low. then a part of the angular momentum of the star can be transferred tothe condensate. we discuss whether an increase of the du threshold density, induced by the presence of hyperons in neutron star interiors, might help explain the high rotation frequencies of old recycled pulsars. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) desy 10 - 043issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2010 * increase of dirac field in low - mass x - ray binaries * + _ submitted to _ eur.phys.j.c _ + _ fachbereich astrophysik, universitt wien, a-1090 vienna, austria _ pacs : + 98.54.ud ( physics department ), 98.80.-k ( relativistic astrophysics ) + 99.82.z ( dynamical theory and relativity ), 97.80.rm ( supernovae and gamma - ray bursts ) # 1to 0pt#1 _ accepted for publication in _ revmexaa
loop quantum gravity is a canonical quantization of general relativity based on holonomies ( the eponymous loops ) as elementary variables. it provides a framework for studying quantum discreteness properties and discrete spatial / space - time structures not only in general relativity but also in quantum field theory and quantum cosmology. its models are still subject to numerous ambiguities, even for moments of the same order. the important question is whether these quantum effects can be fully consistent at all with respect to covariance at the quantum level in the form of, e.g., quantum corrections or form factors. this question is particularly pressing as we turn from local lorentz to a quantum geometry. almost all the effort in effort to answer this question has been devoted to specific constructions of canonical quantum theory but no satisfactory solution has been found yet. here, we use effective equation techniques to address this question, deriving the expectation values of basic operators in canonical quantum gravity and showing how they receive quantum corrections in a consistent form. in particular, we show how the leading adiabatic approximation of an anharmonic oscillator coupled to a time - dependent scalar potential leads to a consistent effective equation describing the dynamics of the system. for low - energy effects, leading quantum corrections can arise from decoherence of the operator @xmath0 in a low - dimensional dynamical system. the effective equations also describe dynamical coherent states, defined as states saturating uncertainty relations at all times, and can thus provide insights into the form and behavior of such states. most notably, they allow a detailed discussion of the ` ` ` anomaly '' in quantum gravity, namely the divergence of quantum predictions from the classical field theory. before the diverging quantum behavior of a quantum state results from quantum corrections, the basic operators of quantum gravity are first considered in the effective regime, and their quantum corrections are computed. in this context, we expect higher - curvature terms to be expected for higher moments, and thus higher - derivative terms to bring about physical effects. we show that this is indeed the case in several effective models, and use these techniques to probe the quantum dynamics of a system in loop quantum gravity.
the creation of bound soliton modes in the crystal is a rare occurrence and to date only a few experiments have been reported for soliton arrays. here we report on the generation of multi - peak polariton patterns in the inhomogeneous bistable polariton regime using two dimensional parametric scattering from pulsed dipole - polariton scattering in a gaas - based @xmath0-cavity. we show that single polariton solitons are triggered by the penning - prichard writing pulse and show that in the bistably high intensity regime the number of created polariton modes increases with the intensity of the writing pulse. we demonstrate that the arrays of polaritons follow a self - similar trajectory, with individual peaks moving one after another, and that their dispersions linearise as a function of the wp intensity. numerical simulations in the phase - dependent parametric nonlinearity regime are able to reproduce the experimental observations. in addition, we report the existence of a stable four - peak x - soliton array. finally, we discuss the relation of our results to the recently reported observation of a large population of coupled te and tm quantum wells at cesr energies and to the problem of two - dimensional polariton dispersion. the interaction of a high - energy laser field with a well populated dispersive wave packet is expected to lead to the creation of a rich variety of interesting nonlinear phenomena. one of the most interesting phenomena in nonlinear physics is the spontaneous generation of localized waves @xcite. the lifetimes of these waves range from a few microseconds to a few nanosecond and range from excited states of highly non - equilibrium states of high enough intensity to potentially challenge our understanding of nature at large length scales. recently, it has been experimentally possible to create polariton arrays by means of two dimensional coulomb interactions between quasi - circularly polarised electrons and photons for a wide range of laser energies and wp pulsed intensities, see fig. [ fig : trainsmod](c, d ). in these experiments the pump is quasi - resonant with the lower polariton branch of a continuous wave ( cw ) and the filling factor of the cw pump is close to that of the pump. minimising the difference between the pump and cavity energies is the most likely source of polariton excitation. for that reason, it is very important to understand the physics behind this phenomenon and to develop methods to detect and control these phenomena. for this purpose,
charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) is a measure of the charge density of a detector which is used to determine the hardness of a ccd detector. the result of an experimental investigation on a prototype cpc - t of the nobel prize - winning imaging semiconductor circuit ( the ccd sensor ) at liverpool university is presented. a 4-phase variant of the cpccd technology with column parallel readout is used for the cti measurement. the charge from a single x - ray photon generated within the depletion region of a target pixel is not transferred completely to the next pixel due to two main effects ; the generation of thermal dark charge at the depletion point and the trapping of charge within the n - buried channel. the results of this measurement using a simple analytic model are presented. the experimental results are compared with full tcad simulations. * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * n. gisin, g. ribordy, w. tittel, m. halder, o. kubischta, j. leuthold, h. zieschang, + * 0.5 cm * _ institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt wrzburg, campus hubland, emil - fischer - str. 31, d-97074 wrzig, germany _ + @xmath0_department of physics, university of liverpool, + liverpool m. b. abrahams, a. k. barnes, s. baets, r. ammar, p. bienstman, and a. baltus, ` ` a new era in ccd radiation hardness, '' * 100 *, 0.2 in * 5.6 in * x. zhang, b. h. a. williams, * 34 * ( 2007 ). e. d. hartmann, t. sphicopoulos, e. g. johnson, i. v. meglinski, l. c. pereira, and b. j. greffet, _ theory of two - phase photovoltaics _ ( dover, oxford university press, 2006 ). w. p. grice, l.- m. lu, he.- y. choi, jones, and r. l. byer, _ introduction to particle - physics journal d _ ( springer - verlag, 2006
exo 2030 + 375, a 42-second transient x - ray pulsar, was observed with the large area detectors ( lads ) of the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory_. in the giant outburst, batse detected 13 consecutive outbursts with peak luminosities of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1. after the 1995 april outburst, _ exosat _ observed the system for the first time. in this paper we present an improved orbit determination, using recent _ rxte _ and _ batse _ data along with more sensitive search techniques developed for this system. the improved orbit removes the two intervals of enhanced spin - up observed by parmar et al. ( 1995 ) when they used the orbit of to correct for the orbital period. the previously known, much steeper orbit, is now consistent with our improved orbit when we average over periods of wind and disk accretion, which is not expected from simple accretion theory. using optical and infrared searches for pulsations, we also find evidence for a density perturbation propagating in the be disk during the outburst. this suggests the presence of an accretion disk, perhaps linked to the system s dynamical instability, and that the one - armed oscillation propagated in the disk has an important role in generating the observed pulsed flux. the large amplitude, 1 - 10 kev, fluxed flux profile presented here is consistent with the profile observed by @xcite from an earlier giant outburst at a similar luminosity. the data suggest a correlation between the be star spin and the observed flux, which would be expected if the disk accreted at a constant rate. however, our data show that the correlation is not statistically significant. possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed, including the possibility that the disk was unstable near the end of the outburst and then, without appropriate feedback, began to be unstable once the source was de - orbited.
recently the correlations between the particles produced in forward and backward rapidities have been measured. the results are from @xmath0 = 200 gev collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ). in this paper we suggest an interpretation of these correlations in terms of multiple parton processes. several model calculations are presented and compared with the experimental data. the model predictions and the data are then compared to the expectations from the various models. the forward - backward correlations are found to be strongly suppressed compared to those from the pythia model at a higher energy of the collision. this effect is attributed to the saturation / drop of the correlation value at high energies. also the energy dependence of the correlations can be explained with a weighted superposition of two components : soft and semi - hard processes. epsf.sty # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 050 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * * * p. prabhat * + _ submitted to eur. phys. j. c _ c _ * f.d. aaron@xmath1, m. aldaya martin lubicz + _ cern, ch-1211 genve 23, switzerland _ + * e - mails : alexa.prabhat@cern.ch, malyal@phys.j.c _ + _ accepted for publication in phys. rev. d _ * # 1 * + * c * * s. s. f. duarte + _ university of santiago de compostela _ _ d.f. l. uhu + _ max planck institute for nuclear physics ( mpik ), 69117 heidelberg, germany _ + number of pages : 69 number of tables : 6 number of figures : 23 * * references : * _ leibniz group, pluto, italy ; _ mnras, mpi, novosibirsk, russia _
high - resolution blue and far red spectra of the central region of ngc3351 have been obtained with isis. in the red arm the spectral range is 4780 - 5200 while in the blue arm it is 8360 - 8760. we present preliminary results for one of them. the rotation curve corresponding to the position going through the nucleus shows maximum and minimum values at the positions of the circumnuclear ring and the nucleus, respectively. its position angle is 0.39@xmath00.39. we observed 11 velocity template stars to provide good reference frames. they are late type giant and supergiant stars which have strong cat features ( ` ` cnsfrs '' ) and in the case of the [ oiii ] emission line an almost constant velocity dispersion of about 30 km / s. we found a shift between the velocities of the broad and the narrow component of the ionised hydrogen deviating from rotation, which is consistent with a radial infall to the central regions of the galaxy. this implies that the gas, and not the stars, is the primary acceleration mechanism for the decelerating ionising matter. the stellar and gas velocity dispersions are consistent with being equal within the errors. however, we found that the position of the ` ` broad component '' deviates from the stellar position by about 35km / s in radial velocity. this difference is larger than that found for the stars and smaller than can be explained by the systematic difference in velocity for the gas and the stars. on the other hand, although the broad component is morecelerated than the stellar one in both the red and blue arm, the differences between them are negligible in the blackbody equivalent widths and in absolute magnitude. therefore, we interpret this difference as due to a deviating velocity from the gas of the star forming regions and/or a stellar rotation within the stellar structures.

we present the results of a study on the light - particle emission from medium - mass excited nuclei formed in @xmath0kr + @xcite reactions at 5.5 mev / nucleon in the framework of the density - nucleon ( dns ) model. the analysis of the fragment - light particle coincidences indicates that light - fragments in very asymmetric fission are produced either cold or at low excitation energies below the particle emission thresholds. moreover, the angular distributions show a persistence of structure effects from elemental cross - sections with a strong odd - even - staggering effect for the lightest fragments. the magnitude of the staggering does not depend on the neutron - to - proton ratio of the emitting nuclei. the data set obtained with a projectile beam differing by 4@xmath1 energy scales roughly linearly with the neutron content of the reaction. the lowest energy production occurs at an incident incident energy of about 5.0 mev/ nucleon where the system is well adapted to the fusion - evaporation scenario. we observe a strong relaxation of the relative kinetic energy gap prior to the breakup of the excited nuclear system. this plays a crucial role in influencing the competition between the binary decay channels associated to fusion and quasifission processes. we conclude that the angular momentum has to be taken into account in the spin - spin balance calculations as well as the dynamical evolution of the interacting partners. furthermore, an accurate measurement of the initial spin - energy distribution is essential to get a better agreement with the various theoretical approaches. 99.80.nn, _ mon. not. r. abbasi. _ * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 1 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 # 1#2#3_phys. lett. b # 1 ( # 2 ), # 3. aut. nucl. phys. b ( # 3 ) # 2. b#1_#2 # 1(#1 ) tr. nuovo cim. # 1_#1 _ # 2 1#1(#2 ) proc. sp. nat. acad. sci. u.s.a # 1*#1 * # 2 * ( # 4 ) # 3 ps. s.w. w.e. wang + _ ph.d. thesis, department of physics, faculty of science, university of maryland, + college park, md 20742, usa _ + _ key words _ : nuclear reactions, heavy - ion physics, dns
we report rxte and bepposax observations of the x - ray binary pulsar 4u 153852. we found no clear evidence for orbital decay like in the other three sources of hmxb pulsars. the system is still observed in a highly circular orbit with an eccentricity of @xmath0 0.18. the measured column density is in good agreement with model predictions using a spherical wind model for the companion star and an accretion mechanism accounting for roche - lobe overflow. we observed the source with the proportional counter array on three different orbital phases covering the out of eclipse phases for two binary orbits. the out - of - eclipse times with better spectral coverage ( going down to 0.3 kev ) enables us to constrain the column density values well. we measured the absorption column density for different inclination angles when superimposed on the high pressure gas scintillator system ( hpgss ) data. we used a model based on the terminal velocity and the asymmetry in the stellar wind to estimate the inclination and mass - loss rate of the companion. the observed inclination is slightly under - inclined which can not be explained by our model assumptions. the mass loss rates are found to be higher than the solar value, consistent with the observations by boettcher et al. ( 2002 ) and clark, woo and nagase ( 2000 ). from the analysis of the two observations, we determined the orbital ephemeris history of the system. the overall spin - up time scale obtained by rubin et al ( 2003 ) is 50.3 lt - s. our pulse timing analysis shows the rate of change of the orbital period from 3.3@xmath1 to 5.9(5 ) years. using the pulse timing results together with the earlier reported measurements, we are able to rule out an orbital decay in this system for which clark ( 2000)a new upper limit.

we report the detection of a young stellar population associated with the optical emission - line filaments in the north - eastern halo of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 5128. the filaments were imaged with the magellan i telescope using fors1. the small pixel scale and the excellent good and stable seeing enabled us to obtain well sampled point spread function ( psf ) images with almost no crowding problems. the psf of the inner filament field contains 1612, 8003 and 7683 stars with photometry in the @xmath0-band, respectively. the outer field contains a larger number of stars with higher number of blue stars, but in that area of the cmd supergiants are also located. the width of the blue to red supergiant loops in the red part constrains the age of the population to within a factor of 2. if we assume that the jet that formed the outer filaments is precessing, it should first hit the outer filament and then turn around and return to the inner region. the large amount of neutral gas that is present in the inner filaments and the short distance of the radio jet from the nucleus indicate that the star formation started at least some time ago, possibly as early as 5 yr ago. we identified the most luminous young stars, which are predominantly distributed along the star forming region, and conclude that they are close to the systemic velocity of the h i cloud. their relative velocities are similar to those observed in classical stellar associations. this means that the likely source of the neutral gas is the same as the one responsible for the current star formation : a very cool i - ionized gas with a mean temperature of approximately 40 k. the approximate correlation between the positions of all of the stars and the main sequence velocity indicates that the activity of the total gas in the direction of the jet must have been very low until the very recent epoch of star formation.

we discuss the possibility of using the emission lines of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) as tools to detect super - massive black holes ( smbhs ). the basic problem with using broad emission lines is that the nature ( geometry and structure ) of blrs in the, so called, ordinary blr ( where only one smbh is present ) is still not known. there are several models which can be applied to explain broad emission, but we focused here on models which could explain unusual double- peaked line profiles and highly shifted broad lines with respect to the narrow component. in particular, we discuss cases where the broad line profile can be explained either by a disk ( or off - axis ) model, taking into account different additional effects, but some specific characteristics as e.g. h@xmath0/h = 1 - 5 and 1 - 2/3 line ratios and variability in the line spectrum can indicate some smb effects. we outline the parameters that should be measured in order to know if smbs exist. in addition we discuss the rare case of gravitational lensing of a binary agn. lastly, we find that the asymmetric line emission should be found in both agn systems. the relative line intensity shifts should be nearly symmetric in the case of smbs, but it depends on the geometry and kinematics of the system. if the accretion disk has a quasi - periodical oscillation as well as the asymmetry of the line emission, the smb should be detected in the near future. in some cases we may not find the smbs ( recoiling smb ) within the distance of a few kpc, but still be able to make some effort because the separation is so large.

we compare the early and late time optical and x - ray afterglow data for grb 011121 with the predictions of the cole et al. ( 1993 ) supernova 1998bw - like model, in which a sn of spectral index @xmath0 similar to that of dar and de rjula ( 2000 ) is transported to the grb s redshift by a slow - moving compact object ( cb ). we argue that all long - duration gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei ( ags ) may in good agreement with the cb - model predictions, and that the diversity of core - collapse sne may to a large extent be due to a spread of viewing angles, relative to the host galaxy s light - distribution. comparing the early ( i, r, v ) and the late time ( j, k, m ) ags spectra, we find agreement, within the small observational uncertainties, with the simulated cb light - curves at different frequencies, as well as with the hst observations of afterglows of days 13 - 14, 23 - 24, 27 - 28 and 76 - 77. at later times we expect the presence of the later sn1998bw, which should ( but does not ) show up in the v band. the difference between the observed spectral index and the one expected is analized in detail. the data confirm, with high precision, the expected gradual evolution of the energy flux density with redshift in all observed bands from the first day to the present day. it is compatible, to within the present - day errors, with that of all ags. the agreement is especially good for the case of ngc 5252, which had a cb of constant baryon density, and is the only seen at late times, in the ivb and v bands. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3, # 4
we report on a detailed analysis of the correlated spectral and timing behavior of the black hole x - ray transient xte j1550564 during its second outburst in 1999. the source was detected multiple times in the 102284 hz energy band with the rxte / pca, and showed a series of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) that were correlated in a manner consistent with a behavior expected for black hole systems. we find that the frequencies of the high frequency qpos are very similar to those of the lower and upper khz qpo in the neutron stars. the qpos have a break frequency ( @xmath0 hz ) of 2.6@xmath1 mhz, which is comparable to what is observed in low frequency qos. another indication of this type of behavior is the presence of a power law tail at high energies, which can be represented by a gaussian distribution with a branch cut in the color - magnitude diagram, and an additional power law component at higher energies. this gives a new interpretation of the observations in terms of two physical parameters : the mass accretion rate and the appearance of the source are controlled by a single physical parameter, while the fraction of the total flux in the very high state ( vhs ) is determined by a combination of spectral properties of the vhs, is, and is / vhs during the entire outburst. we also found that the power spectrum can be described by a two - dimensional model, in which the different states are associated with a broken power law and a disk black body component, giving rise to a strong, band limited noise component. this suggests that the radio emission is due to a medium with a pressure drop and a comptonizing region, in contrast to the canonical one - dimensional picture. # 1#2#1#2 # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1_triglock _ # 1|#1 | # 1*(#1 ) # 1epsf.sty epsfig.

we perform three - dimensional cosmological simulations to explore whether a young and old population of lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) are concordant with a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario. we have incorporated star formation history, sed evolution, and dust extinction. as a result, we have found that the age of simulated laes can spread over a wide range from @xmath0cdm to @xik1yr. our simulations have revealed that there are two types of laes. we define laes younger than @x math3yr as type 1s, and older ones as type 2s. in type 1 laes early coeval starburst occur in small parent halos, while in type 2 laes delayed starburst take place in evolved massive haloes as a consequence of delayed accretion of subhalos. we analyze the multi - wavelength distributions of type1 laes and trace the effect of dust extinction on the spectra. we find that the fraction of type2 laes is less than @axmath4 percent at @xcite. on the other hand, type 1laes are well consistent with the observed fraction of redshifted laes, which is at least ten percent. moreover, the two populations are clearly discriminated at multiwavelengths. by using the correlation function of sub - mm galaxies in the ssa22 field, we found that type 2 lae have a higher probability of being detected at optical wavelengths than type 1 lae. this implies that the optical color distribution of smgs is important for the transfer of ly@xmath10 photons from laes to lbgs. since smgs are not expected to be dusty, this opens the possibility of a large fraction of dusty laes remaining undetected in nir and x - rays. our results indicate that delayed starbursts are not always associated with lae regions, and may occur in any environment.

we report the first detection of a mass concentration some @xmath0 south of the cluster abell 1942. the mass peak is detected in the projected mass profile using a variety of methods to quantify its significance. although a weak gravitational lensing signal is detected, there is no clear evidence that bright galaxies are associated with the mass concentration. we termed the mass clump " because it seems likely that it is the physical manifestation of a larger cluster at a higher redshift, e.g., in a high density universe. the question we address in this paper is whether the dark clump is associated with a massive cluster, as suggested by the possible correlation between its x - ray emission with that of a luminous cluster, or is it due to the random noise of intrinsic galaxy ellipticities? for the latter hypothesis, it is interesting to note that an archival rosat / hri image of a1942 shows, in addition to the emission from the cluster, a 3.2-@xmath1 source close to the mass center of the clump. we note that this source is spatially coincident with the slight galaxy overdensity which is also seen in the deep uh8k image. finally, we present a detailed analysis of the tangential mass alignment of various galaxy images, as well as a measurement of the peak detection significance. a bootstrapping analysis shows that the mass alignment is not dominated by a few galaxy images ; instead, it appears to be dominated by the whole galaxy population located at the mass. no clear overdensity of bright galaxies is seen at this location, either due to a lower light - to - mass ratio, or due to an enhanced local enhancement of the galaxy population. if we adopt the dynamical evolution of the mass distribution found in n - body simulations, the implied ratio of intrinsic to cluster ellipticites is : 1.0 ; 2.5. our analysis suggests that the lower limit for the cosmological mass of a normal cluster corresponds to the galaxy group at the redshift of the cloud, rather than to the halo of a high - redshift cluster. we discuss the implications of our findings for the study of dark matter halos.
we present results from a study of low - frequency radio continuum spectra for a sample of 74 nearby normal galaxies selected from the gb6, nvss, wenss, and vla surveys. to better understand the physical processes which shape the radio spectrum in normal galaxies, we investigate relations between the tabulated source properties (, spectral index and other source properties ) and the numerical hubble type ( early - type or late - type ). we find that the total radio spectral index is @xmath0, the spectral index of the synchrotron spectral index correlate with type, and the ratio of the radio - to - optical major axis diameter is found to be a power law at 1.7 ghz. at higher frequencies, we find a trend in relationship between hubble flow distance and optical inclination. using our knowledge of the optical size and inclination, we estimate the projected path length through the disk of a galaxy based on previous measurements. we also investigate relationships between spectral type and various additional source properties including spectral index, spectral curvature, and non - thermal bremsstrahlung. combinations of these correlations lead to the common conclusion that the spectra of star forming galaxies are well described by power laws. however, quantitative conclusions drawn from these models remain questionable because they do not consider the high degree of inhomogeneity in real galaxies. we do not rule out a population of sources with a broad range of physical properties, including thermal attenuation and/or energy losses, but our data are not robust enough to distinguish between these possibilities. thermal energy losses are a possible explanation for the flat - bottomed spectrum, low frequency flattening, and deviations from a pure power - law. if there are substantial sources of energy which are absorbed by the corona and injected into the interstellar medium, free - free absorption can not produce all the spectral features seen in the integrated spectrum and, even with a large column density, would result in a spectrum which is shallower than observed. other physical mechanisms which could produce a spectrum with significant curvature are discussed include ( 1 ) the radiative recombination, ( 2 ) a cosmological constant, ( 3 ) an inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic fields, ( 4 ) cosmic ray injection, and ( 5 ) curvature in the underlying distribution of cosmic rays.
we investigate the formation of tidal structures such as rings and shells in non - interacting galaxies. we use the hydrodynamical code zeus to evolve a self - interacting scalar field with a mass of @xmath0ev/@xmath1. we find that structures similar to those in elliptical galaxies can arise as a consequence of the quantum nature of the dark matter. we argue that such structures can arise in a variety of galaxy types as well. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) ps. ps 1_1(p ) # 1_p(p)r_1 # 1h_1 = msbm10 at 10pt = cmbx10 at 7pt = cmbsy10 at 5pt = eufm10 at 50pt = mtmib10 at 25pt = sbruy at 10centre for astrophysics and supercomputing + universit de genve + 1211 genve - epsf.gr + institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt wrzburg + am hubland + emil - fischer - strasse 1, 85748 garching, germany + e - mail : msb01@cern.ch + a. bellerive@gmail.com + + r. bernardini@anne.it + y. blouw@damtp.ucl.ac.uk + + s. chu@imate.org + + p.o. box 51 + university of bonn + n.n.w., france + + + g.e. ward@bonn.edu + * acknowledgements : * this work has been supported by the french agence nationale pour la recherche ( anr ) under grant rnms11 - 07444 ( aap ), by the u.s. department of astronomy ( doe ) through grant g34.0404 ( pi ) through the doctoral school ` ` dissipation and absorption in gravitational waves '' ( p. g. smith ) as well as by the university of adelaide, adelaide. p.c. jr. is a professor emeritus in the department of physics + the johns hopkins university, baltimore, md 21218. and he is an associate professor in the school of astronomy, university of southampton, highfield, southampton so17 1bj, u.k. +
we characterize the capacity of a quantum channel to transmit a common classical message whenever the sender alice is able to remotely prepare one of a collection of _ conditional density matrices _ in the laboratory of bob. by a _ quantum channel _, we mean a physical setup in which alice prepares a conditional density matrix from a quantum system in her laboratory and sends it to bob at a rate which depends on a parameter defined by mutual mutual information and conditional mutual information. we shall frequently use the term _ degraded _ broadcast channels, which are defined in the classical literature as the degradable or _ stochastically degraded _ versions of quantum channels. in this sense, we correspond to the _ strong subadditivity _ of quantum entanglement, where the negative of conditional entropy is defined as the average entropy of distributions of conditional probability distributions. we will use this merging primitive to characterize the rate regions of quantum capacity for a class of degraded broadcast channels. the results are all based on a single - letter characterization of the capacity, and extend to nonnegative rates for a broader class of channels.,,, and they are in the spirit of the conditional theorem of shannon @xcite, though they depart from the traditional formulation of the problem in terms of the so - called _ holevo bounds_. nevertheless, the holevo bound remains one of the most intriguing results of quantum information theory, ever obtained. it describes a physical situation in which a quantum agent, acting on behalf of a nonlocal environment, remotely prepares a quantum state. the resulting entangled state is the _ quantum state _, which can be regarded as the pure state of the quantum system. being a consequence of the theorem, such states are known as _ quantum states _ and are of interest in their own right, since they can be used to implement quantum gates, to simulate quantum computation, and to propagate quantum communication. quantum information can also be viewed as a branch of quantum physics, in which quantum degrees of freedom, typically associated with quantum systems, can be employed as a _ resource _ for other quantum systems. the use of quantum states for quantum communication is motivated by fundamental ideas as well as practical considerations. for example, it was shown recently that if quantum systems interact with a classical environment in such a way, then they can use quantum states to store and transfer information at rates which make them useful for quantum computation. also, the equivalence between quantum and classical states was shown to arise naturally in a model of an entangled system in which the output of such a quantum information processor is
we present a high power, single - frequency, continuous - wave ytterbium fiber amplifier system at 1091 nm and frequency doubling of the infrared light to 545.5 nm. the amplifier is implemented in two stages. the first amplifier stage provides up to 3w output power with efficient ase suppression ( @xmath040db ) and the second stage amplifies the output power to 30w. the thermal contact between the crystal and the oven is investigated, producing a maximum harmonic output power of 8.6w and 19.3w at 545 nm, respectively. the theoretical tanh@xmath1-function is matched to the experimental data, which results in a normalized conversion efficiency of 1.8 %/w and an effective nonlinear coefficient of 10.9v / pm. for the second amplifier stage a fiber - coupled laser diode module with up to 60w at 976 nm is used to pump the active fiber. the output spectrum is measured using an optical spectrum analyzer, which yields an ase - supression of about 40db and a maximal seed power of 30w with an efficiency of 52 %. theaterium gallium garnet ( tgg ) is used as the source of up to 20w of infrared light in the green region. two different approaches of frequency doubling are investigated, using a periodically poled lithium triborate crystal and a nonlinear fiber amplifier in an external cavity. the experimental setup of second - harmonic generation in the external cavity is shown. the capacity of the tgg is limited by the pump power. at the maximum fundamental power no saturation of conversion efficiency can be observed, indicating that thermal dephasing is not observed. conversion efficiencies of about 2%/w, noise in the pump light and thermal lensing are investigated. 99 i. klein and m. boyd, ` ` efficiency of single - boyd optical fiber amplifiers pumped at 975 nm, '' opt. express * 15 *, 2143021445 ( 2006 ). m. makowski, m. sykora, a. kolodziejczyk, i. majid, r. wojtsekhowski, l. lazzeroni, v. mikulec, s. rubin, a.- m. salerno, p. m. serebryannikov, f. zhang, x. wang, b. xu, g. s. kang, j. yang, r
the contact matrix of a protein three dimensional structure from its sequence is equivalent to the three dimensional information encoded in its sequence. we examine the relationship between the principal eigenvectors of contact matrix and contact number vector and find that contact interactions between amino acids are needed to reconstruct the unique lowest energy conformations of native proteins. contact interactions are induced in real proteins by pairwise protein pairwise contact interactions if not only two - body interactions but also multi - body effects are included as a mean - field. the contact matrix describing contact interactions is a simplified form of a distance matrix with two types of elements, contact or non - contact for the distance of atom / residue pairs. the spectral representation of the contact and contact energy matrices reveals that pairwise residue - residue interactions as well as eigenvalues are required. in particular, the lowest energy conformation, @xmath0-matrix, is the unique low energy conformation among all the possible solutions for protein structure reconstruction. we consider mathematical lower limits of the total contact energy for which real proteins can be reconstructed from the contact map. contact potentials for native structures are analyzed analytically and shown to have a maximum at a certain threshold energy for contacts of a given pairwise interaction energy. the maximum energy for contact interactions lies between one and two for contact matrix elements. contact number vectors have already been used to discriminate proteins from their sequence. however, it was shown that protein structural information, such as residue connectivities and steric hindrance, not only depends on the type of interacting amino acids but also on the sequence of amino acids in a protein, which makes a significant difference in the probability distribution of their contact numbers. contact matrix, contact number, protein contact interaction, contact potential, protein structure. the failure of identifying protein structures that are made up of two elements, one for which the contact potential is a go - like potential and another for which is a potential that can be exactly like a potential, is analyzed. it is shown that real proteins could not achieve this pairwise potential for a given conformation because of the absence of contact energy since only the ideal contact potential would be measurable and the corresponding ideal sequence for the conformation would be too short. methods : statistical, physical, structural biology, contact numbers, contact matrix
this document provides an overview of the data analysis capabilities of the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) lsc gravitational wave data analysis software. it is written in the transverse traceless ( tt ) gauge, where the weyl tensor component is related to the second time derivative of the spherical harmonics. the system represented by a binary black hole consists of three components : a waveform, a frame ( which is sampled uniformly at each time step ), and the spins of the binary, which are left up to the individual numerical relativity groups. the parameters of the waveform are chosen such that it can be used for data analysis purposes. for our purposes, the multipole moments of the tt tensor are determined so that they can be extracted seamlessly from the data using the lsc software. this document contains the main conventions used for decomposing the numerical waveform data into modes dependent on the time scale and the number of spins. these modes have been defined to be zero everywhere in the space - time in units of the coordinate system and to be valid far away from the source. we provide the preferred method for extracting the mass ratio, the mass zerilli function and the total mass of the black hole in the wave - zone from the multi - component waveform. we also describe how these conventions differ from one another in terms of the relative importance of the start frequency, which is an important parameter in the analysis process. some open issues are discussed which could be addressed by data analysts and numerical relativity simulations. = 1.0 in * program summary * _ title of program : _ ligo : acm / lsc - lsc-2010 - 12 + _ catalogue identifier : _ + _ program obtainable from : _ cpc program library, queen s university of belfast, n. ireland. + _ licensing provisions : _ none + _ programming language : _ fortran-77/90 + _ computer : _ all + _ operating system : _ any unix - like system + _ ram : _ no limits ( system size : _ at most 8 mb ) + _ external routines / libraries : _ gnu general public license + _ nature of problem : _ data analysis : _ the output of a numerical relativity simulation in the full spacetime is the gravitational wavemeasurements as a function of time ; this information is used to characterize the data modes of the simulation, which will be further decomposed into waveforms and discussed at length ; the modes are then used to calibrate
wireless power transfer ( wpt ) technology provides an attractive alternative to power power stations. with simple baseband processing capability, microwave radio power can be transferred to a distance of several meters, meters is about @xmath0w, which is sufficient to power the activities of many low - power devices, such as sensors and radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags. the application of wpt also brings in a fundamental shift of design principle in energy - constrained wireless systems. instead of being utterly energy - conservative in battery - powered systems, one can now prolong the device lifetime and meanwhile optimize the energy harvesting performance by balancing the energy harvested and consumed. for point - to - point energy transfer, many techniques have been proposed to enhance the efficiency through, e.g., multi - antenna beamforming technique, wpt - tailored channel training / feedback, and energy transmitting / receiving antenna and circuit designs, i.e., a special case of the multi - en and multi - wd system considered in this paper. a related work in @xcite designs an interesting energy auction mechanism among the wds in wpt networks to control the transmit power. among them, one effective method is to exploit the frequency diversity of multi - path fading channels in a broadband network, achievable by transmitting multiple energy signals on parallel frequency sub - channels that are separated at least by the channel coherence bandwidth. based on the analysis, we propose practical power allocation algorithm with the considered voting - based continuous - variable ( csi ) feedback. specifically, the power allocated to a sub - channel is a function of the weighted sum vote received from all wds, while the number of votes cast by a wd and the weight of each vote are related to its current energy level. under the proposed framework, we study lifetime - maximizing csi feedback and transmit power allocation designs. finally, simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed distributed charging control methods. _ keywords : _ wireless power, power allocation, energy harvesting, energy - constraint.
the mechanism of intercalation of carbon - semiconductor ( cs ) atoms from the adsorbed adatoms is investigated in detail by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and high - resolution surface modifications ( leem ). it is found that graphene intercalates efficiently at any density with negligible cost, up to 1 m@xmath0, and that the intercalated phase is discontinuous, comprising of small tetragonal micro - tiles, whose expansion can be described as tiling. the appearance of these tiny tiles is due to the presence of vacancies in the graphene layers. the space density of functionalities at the wrinkles crossing points in the stm is found to be strongly correlated with the repulsive van der waals ( vdw ) interaction between graphene and ir. moreover, it is shown that the emergence of wrinkles at high temperatures is essential for the successful desorption of cs atoms, both in the case of dilute and dense concentrations of cs, where the former is enhanced by the partial delocalization of the cs s - electrons to graphene. the role of these entry cracks is additionally described. the -phase reflectsivity shows a dip at a critical energy scale close to that energy, which is a clear indication of the formation of a new dense layer. graphene, a single layer of carbon, has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its unique properties and remarkable mechanical properties @xcite. one of the major advantages of graphene is its ease of transport and stacking properties which makes it an excellent material for very high - density applications, e.g. in flexible electronics and photonics. in addition, since its isolation, graphene has relatively low thermal and chemical reactivity, making it well suited for applications in touch - screen displays, storage and processing, optical and infrared storage, quantum computation and quantum metrology, in particular. at the same time, its unusual electronic and optical properties make graphene an ideal material for quantum information processing and spintronics, owing to the lack of classical constraints in conventional materials. generally, researchers would like to understand the transport and processing of quantum systems by means of stm, because such systems can be used as quantum memories, hence they are more suitable for extending the dimensionality of current technologies beyond the capabilities of standard methods. as a first step in this direction, lately a large number of experiments have been performed on graphene with the aim of performingstm and stm spectroscopy, in order to investigate the properties and the future potential of the material for
a new conjecture is proved which says that a balanced graph of groups with infinite cyclic vertex and edge groups is closed under taking finite index overgroups. the conjecture is based on farrell - jones ideas and was proved in ( *??? * main theorem ). a corollary is a new proof that the @xmath0-skeleton of a group acts geometrically on a connected component of its fundamental group, and hence its direct sum is a wreath product of a direct sum of factors by the factors. + introduction groups are groups that act on trees or graphs of groups and it is their fundamental group that acts on leaves, vertices or edges of a graph. groups acting on trees were first considered in @xcite by j. stasheff, j. spielmann, and m.a. atkin, _ foundations of group theory _ ( crc / taylor & francis, boca raton, fl, 2009 ). j. b. davis, m. airapetian, and l. kuipers, ` ` groups in graphs, '' prog. in cohomology ( saunders, amsterdam, 2000 ). k.f. farrell and j. jones,`` `` groups in trees, '' j. am. math. mon. * 48 *, 482 ( 1900 ). m. a. atkin and r. p. skolnick,``linear group theory in graph theory and its applications to group theory, '' proc. r. soc. lond. a * 253 *, 3133 ( 2002 ). x. xie, z. liu, s. zhang, and t. s. kopp,``entanglement of a monoid by a cyclic edge group, '' phys. rev. lett. * 91 *, 213901 ( 2001 ). g. binnig, _ statistics of groups _ ( wiley - interscience, new york, 1983 ). i would like to present a proof of one of my recent conjectures, namely that the fundamental group of a balanced finite graph of infinite groups with cyclic edges satisfies a long - range order polynomial. to do so i take the following steps : 1. pick a finitely infinite balanced graph@xmath1. map the graph into a group homomorphism space and 2. construct a group trilemma for which the initial graph is a subgraph of the graph of
we examine the possibility that the second acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is suppressed relative to the first acoustic peak based on recent boomerang and maxima data. we show that a phenomenological bump, arbitrarily placed at wavenumber @xmath0, can enhance the power spectrum amplitude around 100 mpc@xmath1, allowing for a baryon fraction greater than expected for a spatially flat universe such as the concordance model. we incorporate the bump into the primordial power spectrum by renormalizing the standard low - density cosmological model to the decorrelated linear power spectrum that was recently generated by ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ). we interpret the 22 decorrelated pscz data points as constraints on the bump parameters so that the theoretical model that we find to be the best - fit to the cmb observational data set can be compared with the galaxy survey observations. the choice of bump parameters is consistent with observations of large - scale power and cmb anisotropies. we find that with the chosen bump the model with a bias parameter of 1.07 ( hamilton & tegmark 2000 ) is ruled out at the 95 % confidence level, whereas the model without the bump takes a biasulus of 1. both models are a good fit to these up - to - date data sets, but the current data do not probe the scales that are critical to distinguishing between the models. we discuss the implications of our results for the scalelengths of adiabatic density perturbations in a model - by - model basis. # 1#2#3acta. phys. pol. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 1 = = = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbh_s psfig.tex # 1 eq.

exotic nuclei are a result of movement away from the valley of stability towards the drip line regions, where the increase in neutron ( or proton ) excess and low binding energy changes the nuclear structure, and leads to unconventional properties for the nuclei concerned. some of these exotic nuclei exhibit special character and are known as halo nuclei. in this paper, we try to analyse the halo character of @xmath0na while calculating different reaction observables if it undergoes elastic coulomb breakup when bombarded with a heavy target at 100 mev / u total neutron separation energy. to this purpose, we use the post - form finite range distorted wave born approximation theory under the aegis of post - equilibrium finite velocity dispersion, and in doing so we have also extended the formalism that includes the resonant and non - resonant effects of the interaction between a projectile and its surrounding continuum. the results are presented in terms of the total one neutron removal cross - section along with its excited state diagram and ground state distribution. we find that, in the absence of any deformation, the peak energy of the breakup reaction is ( 0.17 - 0.50 ) mev for _ all _ ground states considered, whereas the corresponding peak energy for the _ most _ ground state is ( 1.0 - 1.8) mev. the obtained results are used to put some constraints on the parameterization of the six - dimensional reduced transition amplitude. in the region of the intermediate mass region, where a considerable amount of deformation has been experimentally observed, we are able to reproduce the general relativistic halo features, such as the island of inversion, the narrow parallel momentum distributions and the dependence of the ground state spin - parity and shape on the scattering angle, provided the deformation parameter is zero. however, we observe that the obtained in this way has the same qualitative features as the obtained with the conventional shell model, and as such, our results do not favour the formation of halo, even for zero quadrupole deformation. we also find that the narrow momentum distributions are in agreement with the narrower ones which point to broader spatial distributions. this is an indication that the charged fragment should be a halo material, and that no post - acceleration effects should come to light with increase of average momentum.
the decoupling of the optical and x - ray light - curves may be due to the effect of inverse - compton scattering of the forward - shock emission by a relativistic outflow with a significant radial spread. we consider the possibility that the afterglow emission is produced by scattering, and determine the properties of the emission expected from such an outflow if it emits more than @xmath0 of the total forward -shock flux. we find that a long - lived episode of coherent scattering can occur between a decelerating grb ejecta and an incoming, delayed outflow, which may up - scatter some of the back - shock radiation. the up - scattering may produce a series of flares whose spectrum is significantly fainter than that of the primary emission ( a ` ` plateau '' ), overshining it for timescales equal to the delay between the onset of the scattering and arrival time of the subsequent grb flare. alternatively, if the flare is produced at larger radii, then its duration can be arbitrarily small. we discuss the implications of such a model for grb variability, and conclude that it accounts for the power - law decay of x - rays plateaus and flares previously observed in grbs. # 1#2#3#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # 1 # 2 # 3#1|#2| # 3 % # 1 = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx10 scaled1 = cmti8 # 1 ps. = -1.5 cm r.e. langbein@xmath1, h.j. ochsgaard@xumba, j.s. preskill@mlr8, m.b. nicholas@lrc.gov gamma - rays : bursts - ism : jets and outflows - radiation mechanisms : non - thermal - shock waves hydrodynamics shock waves
we present transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectra for pions, protons and anti - protons in high - energy collisions at t@xmath1 = 200 gev and 0.792 gev obtained with the star experiment at rhic. the data are from data taken in 2001 and 2003 using the star detector. a total of 8.2 million minimum bias trigger conditions were obtained for obtaining the data of pion invariant cross - sections at a possible link to qcd calculations using akk fragment function ffs. the identified hadron spectra at large transverse momenta in collisions of proton+anti - proton are found to be well described by nlo perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations using the distribution function for parton populations described by the kaluza - klein ( kkp ) and attenuation - dominated ( akk ) finite - size set of functionals. the characteristics of the nucleon - nucleon, quark - gluon and qcd - based parton distribution functions are studied in detail. we observe a slight enhancement of the probability of having a parton in a hadron as a function of the fraction of the hadron s momentum carried by the parton within the measured transverse - momentum range. the results for the inclusive production of pions are in good agreement with the results from nlo pqcd calculations assuming that the produced pions and protons follow the same scaling laws as in qed. we do not find any significant difference in the charged pion yields at low and high transversemomentum in @xcite or in @acd+acd collisions. however, the data for the ratio of the pion+antigovelocity yield to the combined yield of the two systems provide some indication that the nlo model with akk ffs slightly underpredict the measured charged pions versus proton yields. in addition, the presented data indicate a possible transition in the relative pion production processes from soft to hard cross - section at around 0.6 to hard processes at around 2.7 gev/xmath7. = cmti8_present address = department of physics, brookhaven national laboratory, upton, ny 11973, usa, altaddress = institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt tbingen, d-85748 garching, germany address = nlo physics department, karlsruhe institute
we present a spectroscopic study of the metal content of blue horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars in the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) m4 and ngc 6121. the main aim is to determine the he content of the stars as a function of their oxygen content, and to compare our results with those obtained by measuring the equivalent width of na and o lines in the literature. we use the vlt / uves spectrograph to obtain high signal - to - noise s / n and h@xmath0 spectra in the m4 hb for a sample of 44 stars. for all stars we find that the na / o ratio is consistent with that expected for an o - rich population, while the o / na ratio is higher than the threshold expected for a he - rich star. we also find that all the blue hb stars have an he - enhanced * y * ( mean heliocentric radial velocity @xmath1 ), and that the y elements are larger than the primordial value by a factor of 6. this large he enhancement is unexpected, unless there is a huge increase in the mass fraction of the hb star due to the first dredge - up. we show that this enhancement can not be solely due to a mixing mechanism present when a star leaves the ms, and attributes it instead to primordial pollution of the interstellar material. comparison of the he measurements with photometry from the gcs shows that the best candidates for producing the na - o anticorrelation observed for rgb stars are massive main - sequence stars. this means that the pollution scenario is viable, as long as the initial mass function is not overestimated. we conclude that, at least for the purposes of this paper, the he enhancement we find does not depend on the o or na chemical content. we apply the evolutionary model of @xcite to interpret our results, and show that the currently observed he content in gcs is different from that expected in a typical early - type stellar evolution.
we present the ultraviolet luminosity function ( lf ) of star forming galaxies at @xmath0 from the first imaging with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the nicmos camera onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) of the ultra deep field ( udf05 ) project, a204-orbit hst large program to obtain ultraadeep acs and nicmos observations of multiple fields to study the evolution of the uv lf throughout the redshift regime. the hudf was originally constructed to observe the two nicmos parallel fields to improve sensitivity in the visible and near - ir. unfortunately, the transition of hst to the two - gyro mode and the first failure of acs in june 2006 severely limited the available orbits, so that the planned pointings should have had an orientation such that, while acquiring the acs data for the nicp12 and nicp34 fields, this selection window should have been enlarged so as to take into account the contribution from the youngest stellar populations, especially in the ultraviolet. using conservative assumptions for the dust extinction law and the hydrogen intergalactic absorption relation, we re - derive the faint - end slope of the lf in the most homogeneous way. lfs derived from different data sets are first re - calibrated to identical assumptions for sed distributions, dust properties and intergalatic extinction, before they can be compared to any possible evolutionary effect in the galaxy populations. on average, independent of the assumed input parameters, the extrapolated lf derived from the huxtrends results in a lower average luminosity density : the optically-@xmath1 selected population has a luminosity distribution which is systematically, on the average, better described by a schechter function or a top - heavy imf model, although the difference between the two models at the faint end is only slightly larger than the scatter in our estimate due to completeness corrections, input physical parameters, and possibly cosmic variance.
the weibel magnetic instability is a nonlinear magnetic instability of highly anisotropic, non - relativistic electron - positron populations that forms a transition between an electron - driven electron - ion plasma and a regime dominated by the slower ion weibel instability. we examine the role of the latter in the nonlinear evolution of the weibel magnetization, both in its early growth phase and in its final phase, characterized by continuously evolving plasma and spectral distributions. we demonstrate that the quasilinear kinetic theory, which relates the fluctuation - dissipation equations to the electromagnetic dispersion relation, is able to describe accurately the early weibel filamentation, from whose dynamics the instability is driven by the electrons. from the analysis of pic simulations, we derive an approximate relation between the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) plasma anisotropy and the plasma temperature, and find quantitative agreement with the corresponding approximated growth rate map. the predicted debye - hckel ratio of the system is found to be close to unity at the relatively early times ( @xmath0 ). at later times, when the full range of electron - electron and ion power is occupied by the ions, the near - linear growth rate sharply increases, with a maximum growth rate of nearly one - half the electron transverse wave vector at a transverse ( longitudinal ) wave vector. from this point on, the instability undergoes a continuous growth at an effective rate that, contrary to linear theory, grows at a given by a power law with an effective cutoff at a rate that is one to two orders of magnitude larger than the electron power. this nonlinearity generates significant ion density fluctuations that are not only stable in time but also extend over a wide range of plasma parameters. the results of 2-d particle - in cell - plasma simulations are in good agreement with those obtained from 3-d simulations, where both the electrons and ions initially obey a two - temperature drift velocity distribution. in the following, numerical simulations are presented that illustrate the convergence of the predicted growth rate curve and the corresponding multidimensional physics.
we report on an experimental technique to continuously change the real - space lattice potential as well as the energy band structure of a state - dependent honeycomb lattice. by breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice, an energy gap at the dirac points can be opened and closed continuously. as the experimental technique solely relies on a change of the systems quantization field it opens up new possibilities in both the static and dynamic engineering of such states. furthermore, the applicability of the technique is verified by extensive in - situ selective microwave spectroscopy. our study demonstrates the distinctive nature of bloch bands in presence of dirac cones and reveals an important influence of the external trapping potential on the transition rates. the experimentally obtained results are discussed in a detailed model of an atomic ensemble loaded into the first bloch band and undergoing a landau - zener - stckelberg transition. the implications of our findings on two - dimensional quantum electrodynamics are discussed. bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in optical lattices have proven to be an extremely interesting and rich environment to investigate many areas of physics, such as condensed matter physics, atomic physics and optics @xcite. continuously changing the parameters of an optical lattice can give rise to interesting and important phenomena. for instance, an optical switch can be used to abruptly change the intensity of a single beam in such a way to skip the part of the interaction spectrum that would have otherwise stayed in the linear zeeman effect. this phenomenon of ` quantum phase transitions'is of great interest both for fundamental and applied physics and has been investigated extensively in the context of many - body physics. yet, basic properties such as the lifetime of an atom in its dirac band, the presence of other states in the system and the effects of trapping potentials, have never been investigated with the same experimental techniques that are currently available. quite recently, a new approach to continuously alter the quantum - electrodynamic ( qed ) state of a lattice was proposed @xcitethat it is possible to introduce a _ tunable _ qed state by rotating the qed field around the point that it is intended to trap. as a result, atoms in the hyperfine state can undergo transitions to other states with the help of an effective magnetic field. in the following, we will briefly review this experimental method and show the feasibility of the proposed experimental approach.
we present simulations of infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and colors of embedded super star clusters. we have used a radiative transfer code to mimic the evolution of a young, massive star cluster along a geometric sequence that mimics the earliest stages of cluster formation. the models assume that the central star cluster is a point source and that the total mass of the cluster is much larger than can be explained by the radiation from an interstellar radiation field incident on the outside of the dusty envelope. the rate at which the envelope is dispersed is found to be approximately @xmath0 myr for models with a 10 % stellar mass component and a relative fraction of clumpy dust of 90 % ; the remaining 90 % has iras colors that are included in the range represented by the models. we find that the influence of the various input parameters ( sfe, clumpiness, r@xmath1 ) on the star formation efficiency varies significantly with the total star - formation rate. the effect of the color is the most significant of these parameters on the far - infrared fluxes ; a model with no color difference between the input parameters and the others provides a cluster with a higher stellar mass and a lower sfe than the others. because the color of an embedded star cluster s sed depends on the predominant temperature of the dust in its envelope, the sed and colors can differ by more than an order of magnitude when the appropriate values are used to constrain the envelope geometry. the main results of this study are : ( 1 ) the infrared radiation is more clumpy in the inner regions of the envelope and has a stronger impact on the seds of embedded sscs than in the outer regions ; ( 2 ) at high column density envelopes, which have low sfe values and small r@xsmath2 values, the uv radiation is absorbed in part but not entirely ; ( 3 ) the pattern of the opacity functions in the infrared differs significantly from the one found for global dwarf galaxy sed studies ; ( 4 ) the mid - infrared colors have a strong dependence on the value of the viewing angle between the source and the observer, and ( 5 ) the sensitivity of the infrared camera on the _ jwst _ on the horizon has the potential to measure the timescales at which dust is being dispersed from the embedding envelope.
the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have revolutionized our view of the universe. however, our understanding of how the milky way, our own galaxy, was formed is still at its infancy, precisely 30 years after the seminal merging and accretion events that led to the formation of our galaxy. understanding the structures and evolution of those systems, and their imprint on modern astrophysics, is of critical importance. here we describe the astrophysics mission selected as cornerstone 6 of the esa science programme, gaia. gaia will cover an area of @xmath0 in the plane of the galaxy, including the bulge, disk and halo, and will measure accurately the entire six - dimensional stellar distribution function throughout that region. this will yield accurate distances to a few per cent of the stars out to kpc, and to 1 per cent for the nearest satellites. the faint limiting magnitude will allow investigation of white dwarfs as well as the bottom of the main sequence down to brown dwarfs. the ability to constrain simultaneously and systematically essentially all jupiter - mass planets within 50 pc and with periods between 1.59 years will be achieved by gaia ; this will enable detailed studies of solar system objects, especially those in baade s window. in addition, the faint magnitude limit and all - sky survey of gaia allows unique cosmological studies, accurate studies of massive local group galaxies, and studies of huge numbers of supernovae, galactic nuclei, and quasars. it is uniquely possible in the local group to determine reliable three - dimensional orbits for a significant sample of galaxies, in a region large and massive enough to provide a fair probe of the mass density in theatre.

we use a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to examine the effects of pairs and tidal interactions on galaxy properties, in order to examine how local environmental density affects galaxy star formation. we find that in relatively high density regions, like the large - scale voids and clusters, the star - forming fraction of pair galaxies is higher in high density environments ( log @xmath0 = 0.43 - 0.55 ) compared to the general galaxy population. in low density environments, interacting pairs trigger star formation, while pairs in high - density regions do not. the reason for this difference is that in those regions is largely determined by the depth of the potential well of the cluster, in which the star formation rate is higher for closer pairs. we also find that a large fraction of the physically bound pairs ( 59 %, 28 % ) are wet, dry and mixed, which are in excellent agreement with the corresponding fractions of 51 %, 56 %, and 29 % in clusters, respectively. we show that the environments of these pairs are consistent with the colour - density relation, suggesting that the amount of cold gas in these pairs is not the primary driver of galaxy evolution. as a result, neither mergers nor direct interactions of galaxies do not quench star formation prior to merging, so that the cold gas can be readily replaced by hot gas in the subsequent interaction. this suggests that no significant bursts of star - formation were generated prior to the mergers. finally, we synthesize our results into a coherent physical scenario, where the main conclusions are as follows. \1 ) largely independent of whether they are physically bound or not, the main conclusion we find is that galaxies in close pairs tend to have higher specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) than galaxies in clusters or voids. specifically, the ssfr of a pair of close pairs is a monotonic function of the local density, defined by the local overdensity, @xcite. coupled with the h@xmath1 equivalent width of the hubble expansion, this gives a lower mean ssfr for the close pairs than the total galaxy population ( assuming that the two will merge ). \2 ) for galaxies that are in pairs, the typical characteristics of starbursting galaxies are seen to be bluer with increasing local density. we predict that if observers look for pairs specifically in and near voids, they will find that the pair population will not have a larger fraction of strongly star forming galaxies than the void population. however, in voids the pair fraction is similar to
we study the first - order fermi acceleration processes occurring at relativistic shock waves in the resonance energy range for particle - wave interactions and investigate the role of the magnetic field structure and the upstream magnetic field perturbations in producing the resulting particle spectra. the simulations are based on the fokker - planck pitch - angle diffusion equation using a standard semianalytic method. the perturbed ( ` ` turbulent '' ) magnetic field component is modeled as a superposition of static sinusoidal waves of finite amplitude. the parameterization of the phase space distribution function, @xmath0, in the full energy range includes the shock lorentz factor, wavenumber, amplitude and spectral index of the turbulence, as well as the wavevector range of the distribution and its anisotropy or nonuniformity. the results presented in the present paper focus mainly on the oblique ( superluminal ) shocks. by varying the amplitudes and spectral indices of the turbulent magnetic field and the mean field inclinations, we were able to study the acceleration processes in a wide range of background conditions, including both sub- ( normal+)/superlumininal shocks and a limited particle diffusion along the shock normal in the downstream region. simulations show that the generation of the power - law tail of the spectrum at the shock for short - wave turbulence is very important in the case of the considered perturbed conditions near the shock. in most cases, including most notably, the highly anisotropic particle distribution and the existence of a strong resonance and energy cutoff, an energy cutoff appears in the spectrum within the resonant range for moderate - amplitude interactions. the spectra calculated for the parallel shocks can be either steep or flat, and the derivation of the spectral index and the spectral cutoff can not be explained by the commonly assumed background magnetic field configuration. the important finding is that the spectral features such as the cutoffs for the long - wavelength cosmic ray background energy spectra present in oblique shocks occur because of the decrease of the minimum magnetic field amplitude with respect to the upstream conditions. this result allows for the description in terms of a bremsstrahlung spectrum, which is non - monotonic in the low - energy region for moderately perturbed magnetic fields, revealing previously unexplored features of the particle spectrum.
nnser is a very close binary star system with a @xmath0 m star in a very tight orbit around a 1.4 m - type m4 dwarf secondary. the secondary star plunging into the envelope of the red giant primary at the edge of a planetary orbit, the resulting ` ` common - envelope '' ( ce ), has its own internal energy. for the first time, we have obtained precise time - scaling and timing measurements of the light curves of eclipsing nnser. the new light curves show a quasi - periodic change in the effective orbital period on a timescale of more than two decades. the precise timescales are much too short to be due to the applegate mechanism ( parsons et al. 1993 ), so we attribute the variations to _ additional _ circumbinary objects. we have also obtained very precise high - precision timing measurements in the past decade using the vlt, eso danish 1.5 m, ccd photometry on a smaller telescope by pigulski & michalska ( 2002 ), and vlt / eso b ( 2006 ). the results are in good agreement with earlier measurements and indicate that the variations are due to pure quantum gravity, with the largest amplitude and depth determined by the bondi - hoyle drag coefficient. we also derive the intrinsic length of the trail along the orbit, and find that the trail length ( and thus the ratio of the start time to the end timestep ) must have been _ in the range _ 0.45@xmath1 ( i.e., shorter than the orbital timescale ) for the original binary. combined with white - dwarf light curves, we estimate that the binary was formed at a time _ before _ the planets were created. the planets must have existed before the system was created. we briefly discuss the possible origins for the observed timing variations, and in particular, how they might be related to the presence of a third body.
in this paper we review recent advances in the theoretical study of the adsorption of ionic liquids on metallic electrodes. in particular we present a detailed analysis of the recent results obtained by using simulations which employ either the molecular dynamics or monte carlo methods to determine the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at each step of the simulation. such simulations are most often performed with respect to potentials which are determined self - consistently by solving poisson s equation on a grid. in the set of simulations presented in this paper, the ions are assumed to store the electrolyte in a double layer which consists of two layers. the first adsorbed layer carries a charge which is larger in magnitude ( but opposite in sign ) to that on the electrode. this leads to the formation of a lattice saturation rgime where the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the ions at the electrodes is exponentially suppressed due to the predominance of su(3 ) charge screening between the layers. in parallel, the impact of the electrodes thickness and geometry on the potential experience by the ions is studied by siepmann _ et al. _, who have shown that in the case of nanoporous electrodes, an electric potential drop occurs in the region for which the potential experienced by any charge is equal to the preset electrode potential. we show that this drop is a manifestation of the overscreening effect, and we elucidate the origin of this effect by demonstrating that it is caused by the minimization of the difference between the heights of the upstream upstream and downstream potentials. our simulations also show that the shape of the differential conductance is crucial for the correct interpretation of experimental data, since it has to be understood that the average capacitance of the ionic liquid is determined by its charge distribution at the electrode surface and is a function of the electrode geometry. finally, we also discuss the results obtained when no data from constant potential simulations are available.
we present a new catalogue of extremely red objects ( eros ), selected from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 f814w-band imaging of @xmath0 fields in the hubble deep field north. our aim is to examine the nature of the ero population to determine whether it is dominated by galaxies with bulge - like or disk - like morphologies, as well as by evolved, passive systems. our approach incorporates deep multicolour imaging in addition to the optical and near - infrared coverage of the survey area, allowing us to break the age - metallicity degeneracy which plagues most existing colour - selected ero surveys. we find that the majority of our eros are not simple star - forming galaxies, rather they are composed of morphologically unclassified sources with a wide range of properties, with around 17 % of the objects showing signs of merger / interaction. we use photometric spectral energy distribution fitting to investigate the fraction of these unclassified eros. accounting for the colour turnover in our number counts leads to a number density for passive eros of around 19@xmath1, consistent with the median value in the literature. the normalization of this number density implies a turnover in the number of active eros with apparent magnitude of around 0.8. modelling the source morphologies with pure luminosity evolution models has difficulty in explaining the number counts, as a large fraction of eros at faint magnitudes are missed due to reddening. we compare our observed ero number counts with those of galaxies in the local universe that are believed to be dusty, yet have high redshifts, providing strong evidence that the latter is not a reliable indicator of the present day star formation history of the universe. the remarkably, our ero counts match well with those derived from radio surveys of very red galaxies, despite the fact that our survey probes distances which are much fainter than the centroid of the radio - selected population.

we have performed an independent analysis of 536 rr lyrae ( rrl ) stars discovered in the ogle - ii database around the large magellanic cloud ( smc ). the rrab and rrc stars in the 11 areas close to the bar of the smc have well - sampled photometric light curves in the i band. we employed the fourier decomposition technique to determine the physical parameters of the stars, which is shown to be a very robust and powerful technique for describing the shape of the observed light curves of rrl and other variable stars. we have found that the mean distance modulus of the rrl stars is 18.86@xmath0 mag, taking 10 eclipsing binary rrab stars into account. taking into account the deviation parameter from the theoretical period - radius - metallicity relation of marconi et al., we obtain a mean difference of 18.90 mag with respect to the theoretical value. the difference increases from 0.9 mag to 2.1 mag in the v band. the mean value of the correlation coefficient @xmath1 is found to be 0.994 for the rrrab stars and 0.130 mag to 1.0 mag for therrc stars. the dispersion of the radial component of the mean observed light curve is 0.36 mag, whereas that of the amplitude is 1.12 mag. in particular, the dispersive phase and the phase - weighted mean magnitude are in good agreement with the theoretical light curve results. the present determination of the distance scale of smc has been based on analyzing v and i band rrl light curves, which are of high quality and have been used extensively in the studies on distances to old and sufficiently metal - poor systems. we derive the distance scales of the local group ( lrg ) and the main cluster ( m3 ) based on the v - i fourier coefficients. also, we have made use of the accurate photometric parallax and the h - r diagram of vycla star to estimate the reddening and extinction of the line - of - sight towards the lrg. the distances to the lmc and the m3 have been estimated using these two methods.
this article proposes a new approach for the synthesis of low - dimensional suboptimal controllers for optimal control problems of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) of parabolic type. the underlying idea consists of seeking for manifolds @xmath0 $ ] which provide over a finite horizons an _ approximate parameterization _ of the small scales of the solutions to the _ uncontrolled pde _ associated with the _ finite - horizon parameterizing manifold _ ( pm ) ; see _ e.g. _ the monographs @xcite. when the pm is an approximation to the gradient of the cost functional, efficient ( and accurate ) solutions can be designed by such methods which lead to high - dimensional problems that can turn out to be computationally expensive to solve. reduced - order modeling ( rom ) techniques relying on basis functions allow, at a given time, to design a _ surrogate _ controller from which the true controller can be driven by a locally solution driven by the high - mode energy or by the ( disregarded ) one, depending on the scale of the pde solution to be controlled. such suboptinal controllers can be easily designed by standard methods of finite - dimensional optimal control theory ; in that respect, they are similar to the systems derived from _ inertial manifoldolds _ ( ims ) employed in control theory of large - dimensional or distributed - parameter systems. the analytic formulas to get access to such pms are derived and analyzed. numerical results are also presented showing that such pm - based controllers provide for good performances provided that the parameters of the model and the energy contained in the high modes are small enough, in agreement with the theoretical predictions of theorem [ thm_controller ] and [ cor_2 ]. this is illustrated on a burgers - type equation in the context of globally and locally distributed control laws. pdes are often designed by means of numerical simulations and computational machine learning methods. although the analysis is still in progress, several open problems are known : for instance, it was proved recently that a nonlinear observer can provide accurate feedback controllers for the system through the construct of a closed - loop center manifold for a truncated hilbert space - like variable.
in 1970 lawson showed that for any immersion of a profile curve there exists a 1-parametric family of immersions @xmath0 with constant mean curvature 1 and that this family is called _ twizzlers_. thus, using the group of symmetries of the delaunay surfaces, he defined the _ treadmillsled _ of the profile curve of a twizzler as the trace of the origin when this curve rolls rolls on a treadmill located at a point in the plane that is aligned with the axis of symmetry. in this paper, we interpret his result in terms of the so - called ` ` properly immersed vs. dense '' property of twisted surfaces. in order to do this, we have to understand the level sets of the corresponding undoloids. we have show that the sequence of the differentials of the undoloid is not countable and dense, which implies that the existence of a minimum value of the gauss curvature requires a special type of density. moreover, we establish a relation between the footpoints of the profiles and the levels of the function that produces the nodoid. as an application, we give a formula for the length of the fundamental piece of a dual profile curve. _ key words and phrases : _ profile curve, dirichlet surface,twizzler, deaunay surface, ginzburg - landau equation, integral equation, gauss equation, nodoid1904,064. _ ams subject classification : _ 60g44 ( primary ), 60g42.2 ( secondary : 60g34.3 ), 34e10.5 ( primary : 34c10.1 ) _ introduction. _ the main result of this paper is the following : [ section ] [ theorem]corollary [ theorem1]proposition [ theorem2]lemma [ theorem3]definition [ theorem4 ] this paper has two main goals. first, we want to express the extent of the results of lawson s paper in a form that makes it easy for others to find the solution and study it by studying the technical side of the result. for example, we will use the following frame : [ figure 1.1 ] the 2-dimensional representation of the 1-d proton problem. the aim of the paper is to provide a interpretation for the profile curves of 2-d twisted surfaces, as well as for the 0-d case. we will do this by using the same introduction as in the first section. the purpose of
it is often argued that quantum mechanics is a _ hidden variable _ theory where the state between two measurements does not depend on either of the two. this is based on the _ non - collapse _ interpretation of the quantum state as a theoretical bookkeeping device of _ past _ events. me, on the other hand, argue that the state of the world at a given time is not something else. it is, in my opinion, just a way of bookkeeping the real events we are aware of. an important point is that the evolution of the state is not time - reversal invariant : a given un - oriented sequence of quantum events does not determine a time arrow. we interpret that, instead, the state we happen to know about the ( past or future ) interactions of the system is simply a representation of what we have to do with the system at that time. this implies that nothing in the quantum theory can determine what happens in the future, and everything in the past, _ as well as _ in the domains of dependence of the wave function. pacs numbers : 03.67.-a, 03.65.ud, 42.50.qy, 03:45.+h a recent proposal for a hidden variable theory of quantum mechanics has been put forward @xcite. it makes the hypothesis that there is a solution to the problem of the form of the observed quantum state : what happens when we think about a quantum measurement? in this limit, we are not interested in the details of the actual physical laws at work, we only consider the observable quantities at work : the ( quantum ) wave function and the ( classical ) expectation value. this allows us to get clarity about the meaning of a quantity in the context of the many worlds interpretation ( or, more generally, in a regime where the theory reduces to physics we understand. in this talk, i will be addressing a question often raised in the literature : when is the world cut into two ` ` ` worlds '' ( worlds " ) and what happens with respect to each other? to put the discussions on firm ground, i start with the simplest case of a quantum wave function in a semiclassical approximation of quantum theory. i will then explore a quite general ontology for quantum theory, namely, a classical - like system s variables, whose dynamics is guided by a ( sufficient ) series of measurements in the region @xmath0 ( world at time ), that happen when physical systems interact. the ontology is rather simple : it is based only on the evolution
we evaluate eigenfunctions of the one dimensional @xmath0-spin xxx lattice at large distances. we consider effects of interaction of spins with external magnetic field. we show that magnetization and other properties of the system change as magnetic field approaches the critical value. these changes give rise to various interesting phenomena such as asymptotic second order correlation functions, critical index and localizable entanglement. the model was generalized to the case of xxz antiferromagnet. in 1930 hans bethe found the eigenstates of the bethe anizet ( anz ) model@xcite. his results were later extended to different types of lattice materials. the search for exact solutions of the model has continued. in this paper we revisit this problem considering effects of magnetic field on the ground state of the xxx model. the magnetic field interacts with individual spins in such a way that magnetic energy is transferred from the spins to the environment. the calculation of quantities of this kind is quite difficult but recent breakthroughs achieved in this area e.g., k. sakai and m. takahashi in @xcite, see refs. and ref.. it took a long time to find low energy effective theories for the model and _ _ has been the subject of intense research since the nineties. the models are classified into three types according to the location of their magnetic susceptibility ( magnetization ). in most general case, magnetization is not critically connected to any other spin components. in some cases, magnetic field might affect the behavior of the magnetization, for example spin - passbands, in the same way that light fields are affected by magnetization. naive solutions to the model are not accessible anymore and it is of crucial importance to clarify the way in which this chaotic system can be described quantitatively. the aim of this paper is to provide a general framework for the analysis of correlations of the xxz spin chain. the calculations can be carried out in the following two steps. first we review the standard textbook on the subject. in section 1 we recall basic concept of concurrence and in section 2 we give an explicit expression for correlation function. in 3 we review concurrence before the measurement. in 4 we consider two special cases of xx xx xx chain and then in appendix a we give the lower and upper bounds of linear correlations.
we report on the star - forming complex around the bright ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) in the late - type spiral galaxy ngc4559. _ hst_/acs data show that there are no other sources in the field brighter than the acis - s 12-count detection limit. based on previous optical studies, we suggest that the x7 ulx is a young system, and that its main stellar population is composed of stars formed over the last @xmath0 myr. the type of star that we find is difficult to reconcile with the conventional star - formation scenario, in which the accreting black hole ( bh ) was formed from an ob companion in a similar episode of star formation. we also find that the h@xmath1 image does not show any massive stars, nor does it trace the presence of a supergiant donor. we consider all of these factors and argue that the observed properties are consistent with an bh that has grown via normal stellar evolution, and not from runaway core collapse. we suggest the following scenario : the ulx was formed when the bh was still in its bh stage, and has a current accretion rate of @xcite. this star expanded its thermal equilibrium radius due to the effects of uv irradiation ; it then accreted matter from a surrounding h region, resulting in the bright ulx. the agn phase is associated with this bh, and may be responsible for the current low metal abundance in the region. the x - rays are being absorbed by molecular gas in the outflowing wind ; this gas is a plausible candidate for the donor star, if it is the true optical star. we are planning to use _ chandra _ to obtain spectroscopic observations of the field to test this hypothesis.

we have used new hubble space telescope ( hst ) data of the nuclear region of the quiescent galaxy m32 to construct three - integral dynamical models that fit the kinematical data. the models are general in the sense that they make no assumptions about the dynamical structure of the galaxy, and they can be used to calculate weighted superpositions of orbits to find the one that best fits the observed line - of - sight velocity profile shapes. one of the main goals of our project is to determine whether the new hst data can rule out models without any dark mass, or to determine to what extent they constrain the mass and size of the dark object in m32. we find that models with a constant mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0 ) can fit the ground - based data, but this requires the presence of a nuclear dark mass. moreover, the models demonstrate that the data do not rule out a black hole ( bh ) in the nucleus, despite the fact that the predicted values are below the sensitivity of the current data. models without bhs must therefore be possible, but they can not be very likely to fit the data in the way that would be required for a bh. we have also used our new models to construct estimators of the best - fitting phase - space distribution function ( df ) of the stellar mass density. these are the first accurate estimations of the m32 df, which we assume to be the same as the ( model - independent ) distribution functions that have been used to interpret previous hst observations. the implication of the new models is that m32 has a df that is not of the form @xcite, which is the case for most previous self - consistent dfs constructed for this type of geometry. the best fits are virtually identical for both inclinations and all inclinations. the inclination angle of m32 is only determined by the value of the gauss - hermite moments in the fitting.
we investigated the evolution of a fragmenting sunspot using high resolution filtergrams and spectropolarimetric measurements from the japanese satellite _ hinode _. we observed and analyzed the following processes : i ) the formation of a light bridge in the umbra ; ii ) the fragmentation of the sunspot at the position of the light bridge ; iii ) the decay of the fragment ; iv ) the restoration of the penumbra in the parent spot. in particular, we observed the rotation of the spot caused by the fragmentation ; and the in - situ change of the parent sunspot s orientation across the sunspots as a result of the fragmentation. the g - band data were used to determine the angle between the line - of - sight towards the sun and the linear background vector. the intensity gradients in the image cover a large range of the angle, from @xmath0 at the inner sunspot region to nearly vertical in the outer ones. the study of the orbital motions in the fragmented sunspot revealed that the relative velocity differences between the parent region and the surrounding region are no longer a linear function of the azimuthal angle, but scale instead with the radial velocity, with the internal and external fields of the region ranging from 1 to 1.5 kg. we put an upper limit of about 120 km s@xmath1 on the flux change rate of a sunspot divided into two parts and analysed the time sequence of the decay. the first section corresponds to the time when the full sunspot pore was formed. the second half of the spectrum is characterized by a partial penumbral formation inside a pore. fragmentation commences with the depletion of thepenumbra close to the anchorage points of light bridge and their subsequent reconnection with the external field, possibly through magneto - convection. the fragment becomes unstable and breaks up into a dozen or so particles, which are transported out of the area by moving magnetic features ( mmfs ). mmfs are punctured by ` evershed clouds'and appear as temporary penumbras within the fragment. the trail of mmfs extends to the region of fragmentation and the final decay is observed to be very long, with mmfs disappearing within one or several weeks. the leading - order correction to the photosphere angle obtained from the analysis of the lower - order limb darkening coefficients was not detected in the data. this can be attributed to the fact that the former mmfs had a lifetime of more than 7 years and required mmfs
we report the first large - sample abundance determinations of the elements ge, zr, os, and pt, observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) using keck i high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) in a sample of 11 metal - poor galactic halo stars. we also present detailed abundance information for the two well - studied @xmath0-process - rich stars 22 and 17. the hst / hires spectra of ir are used to make comparisons with the ground - based abundances of this element, as well as with those of the very heavy and most extensively studied, rare - earth elements eu, ba, and eu. there is a very large star - to - star scatter in the derived zr abundances with respect to fe. this scatter suggests that ge and zr are quite similar in origin, and that the relative contribution of these elements to the total fe abundances in these stars is not a simple power - law function of fe. os abundances are found to be highly correlated with the rr lyrae abundance, while zr and the zr abundance scatter are very small, indicating a different origin for this light, heavy @x0-capture element. the heavy o has a very small scatter and its behavior as a function of o / fe is also very similar to that of the lighter zr. we find a very low correlation between o and ba that suggests a much more complex nucleosynthesis at very low metallicity, perhaps requiring a more complex reactions ( e.g. core - collapse supernovae or gamma - ray bursts ) than has been proposed for the light elements. we confirm the previous suggestions that at least in some of the earliest, or all metal - deficient stellar populations, an early type of alpha - rich freeze takes place in some or all stars at [ fe / h]@xmath1 -4. in the case of 22, this type of freeze is consistent with the observed elemental abundances for the elements nd and ho, and seems to require a very early formation of the most massive stars ( at least 10 gyr ago ). however, we find that the predicted nd abundance falls off systematically with o due to the large scatter in this ratio, and we suggest that this result is the result of a rather abrupt change in the initial conditions of the stars, possibly as a result of the onset of supernova feedback. the observed distribution of nd abundances also deviates significantly from
we give a short introduction to the golomb - welch conjecture which states that : there is no periodic @xmath0-error - correcting lee code in a finite abelian group. we present several reformulations of the conjecture, and describe various approaches how the conjecture has been tackled so far. in this paper we initiate the study of a new invariant introduced by etzion ( _ annals of statistics _ @xcite ) called the embedding number of the lee groups. we prove that the value of the number is invariant under the group isomorphism. as a corollary we show that the minimal number of elements of the cyclic group that need to be embedded is the same as the number of words in the word ` ` lee sphere '' used by the authors. * introduction * throughout the paper we consider the basic question : is there a periodic ( lattice ) tiling of the completeness set of the set of finite abelsian groups? or is there an exception to the g - w conjecture? to answer the first of the two questions we will use the term ` ` tiling '' we will take a look at a recent algorithm proposed by minkowski ( _ jacm 2005 _, _ prog. math. phys. _ * 79 *, 133 ). the answer to the first question can almost immediately be deduced from the well - known results of golomb and welch(2005 ). for instance, it is well known that : for any finite, continuous, subspaces of the complex projective line in a modulo an intersection of the ideal group with a non - empty homomorphism of odd symmetric forms the elements of that section are embedded at the appropriate lee distance. in other words, we will say that we '' tiling the complements the teichmller space of the group. the second question is to what extent different types of ` ` ` perfect '' codes can be embedded in the tiling. so far, two approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem ; one is the use of the so called ` ` optimal lee - type local structure '' for parameters ; in the case when the parameters are sufficiently small the results are known. the problem is proved by means of a different approach which we will refer to as ` ` selective coding '' method. the key idea in this approach is to use the equivalence principle to embedding numbers in the plane of leegroups. we will show that, in
a systematic study of the globular cluster and ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) in the fornax cluster is presented. based on keck spectra and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images, we find that thirteen objects are currently identified as dgtos in the vicinity of m87, the cd galaxy located at the dynamical center of virgo. with absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath0, these objects would be among the most luminous and compact objects known to reside in m87. in terms of luminosity, the objects occupy a luminosity regime which is populated by the brightest known globular clusters and the faintest known de galaxies. while all of our program objects are brighter than m87 s luminosity limit, they fall outside the field imaged by the acs virgo cluster survey. using published photometric and radial velocity properties, we use the scaling relations to investigate the structural, photometric, and dynamical properties of these objects and use them to investigate their classification as either globular chambers or ultra compact dwarfs. extrapolating down in luminosity to the same region of the sky as the galactic bulge and the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies, we observe that _ all _ of our targets are dwarfs with _ higher _ mass - to - light ratios than normal dwarf galaxies. this result suggests that ( 1 ) the dwarfs are embedded in dark matter halos of higher surface - brightness ; ( 2 ) they have a common origin with their low - mass analogs ; ( 3 ) the ensemble of dwarfs we see in virgo resembles the local group dsph galaxies, whether or not accompanied by detectable nuclear nuclei ; ( 4 ) and one of our ten targets ( ngc 2419 ) has the highest _ half - light radius _ found to be a fraction of a magnitude larger than the typical size of typical dwarf galaxies in the milky way ; ( 5 ) all objects have a median structural aspect ratio ( i.e., sfr ) larger than 3, and are physically associated with galaxies of similar dynamical mass ; and ( 6 ) the spatial distribution of these dwarfs resembles that of their local group counterparts. we conclude that this faint and compact stellar population is clearly bimodal, with more than two classes of objects showing a scaling relation for the space density at the spatial resolution we probe. the most intriguingly, two objects ( s314 and s490 ) appear to lie on the
we present a survey of low redshift ( @xmath0 ) optically - bright submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) with spectroscopic redshifts. our sample, based on the keck / nirspec and vlt / isaac near - ir spectroscopy of a sample of ten smgs, covers a range of restframe uv spectral types from n@xmath10.7 to soft x - ray. our redshift distribution is clearly bimodal : 60 % of the smgs in our sample are spectrally identified while the remaining 15 % are non - spectroscically - identified. this paper discusses the basic properties of these galaxies, including their star formation rate density ( sfr ), their luminosities at various wavelengths, their contribution to the far - infrared background, and their relation to other populations of galaxies and agn at high redshift. we find that the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of our smg sample are an order of magnitude smaller than those of luminous galaxies at the same redshift, suggesting that smgs are much less centrally concentrated than their luminous counterparts. although our sfr is not significantly dominated by the starburst population, it is consistent with that of the local universe dominated by an agn population. we also find a strong correlation between the characteristic sfr ( for a salpeter imf ) of a starburst and the radio flux density of the galaxy corresponding to the bolometric emission from fir. however, our radio - undetected smgs can not be distinguished from the agn, despite the fact that they have a comparable radio luminosity. we argue that although these galaxies have a larger submm flux density than present - day star - forming galaxies, they are not high luminosity systems, and hence will not be high - redshift objects ( lrgs ). their sed properties remain poorly constrained, but we do find some evidence for evolution in the luminosity - dependent sed of our sample.
the spread of influence in the social network observed in the past is one of the most active areas of research in social network analysis. it can be considered as a trade - off between working with the static network and the temporal network and it leads to important decisions regarding initial set of nodes that next could influence others in the most efficient way. the main assumption introduced here is that the influence spreads are dynamic, i.e. nodes and social relationships may both appear and disappear, thus the dynamic phenomena of the network may significantly influence the final outcome. for that reason, the research can turn to temporal networks that only partially aggregate events, whereas an aggregated social network reflects typical static seeding circumstances. two main network aggregation types have been recently studied : static network that aggregates equally all knowledge from the past ( @xmath0 ), whereas temporal network that reflects the events for a particular period - in - the - past for all nodes ( @xcite ). it has been shown that the results of these studies differ depending on the strategy that is adopted for the initial seeding. for the temporal networks, the heuristics based on network measures such as total degree, in - degree, out - degree and betweenness have achieved quite good results in experiments, especially when comparing with the ones based on static network data. on the other hand, for the spatial network structures, most of the usual approaches could not achieve such high final results, when compared to the temporal ones. it was found that the outexp measure was obtained not by constant intense contacts with the same group of nodes over long time but by exchanging the dense neighbourhoods from window to window as well. as a result, during the influence part of these nodes were able to influence new neighbours in consecutive time windows, giving better final results. the in - depth analysis of the position of seeds after choosing initial sets of nodes also revealed that in all datasets the nodes that were initially influenced and used to influence others were located on the boundaries of the same network. * keywords : * social networks, influence, seeding, network, temporal networks
we present multiwavelength observations of the flat spectrum radio quasar 4c @xmath0221.35, obtained at the very large area telescope ( lat ) and the vhe gamma - ray observatory ( vlt ), during two very strong flares in 2010 april and june. the source was in a quiescent state from the start of _ fermi _ observations until a period of intense flaring activity in the first half of 2010. in particular, four strong flares with very rapid variability were detected in 2010 february june, followed by a sustained period of quiescence lasting for almost a month. the combined he and vhe spectrum can be described by a single power - law, with a photon index of 2.7@xmath10 0.3, and no evidence for a cutoff. the uv optical light curve is variable on time scales of a day, and the ratio of the core - to - extended radio fluxes at ghz frequencies is virtually constant, contrary to previous results that indicate a break in the flux - optical correlation. we model the optical emission as due to a relativistic jet inside the broad line region ( blr ), rotating at a significant angle with respect to the central black hole ( bh ), which can be modeled by varying only the electron distribution, with the electron electron distribution tunneling through the blr. the locations of the emission regions are consistent with those found at lower energies by other authors. the most plausible candidates are : ( 1 ) a compact emission region at the pc scale, ( 2 ) a rapid - spinning prograde bh, with some evidence for self - collimating jet structures, or ( 3 ) a region of very high energy ( vhe ) emission emanating from the inner jet. we favor the latter model, but it is not sufficient to explain the strong flaring behavior observed. a possible alternative model is a very narrow jet, as in the jets - within - jet / mini - jets scenario, but the likelihood of such a thin jet being in the beam of the central bh is small, unless the half - opening angle of the jet is very large.
we observe long - range correlations in a literary text as the output of a stationary and ergodic source that appears in the binary sequence associated with a letter. the correlation length is a measure of the information content of the text. here we study how correlations flow from the topic to the words used to encode information and how information is transmitted via a flow from high- to low - levels. first, we observe that a few high - level words saturate for non - overlapping sequences and that correlations are preserved at lower levels. we show that on the semantic level relevant observables ( e.g., the length of consecutive @xmath0 s ) already show correlations via burstiness and that these correlations are invariant under the principle of the arbitrariness of the sign. second, we introduce a hierarchy of levels for symbolic sequences and we show an intriguing connection between the correlation properties of words and the structural properties of the sequence of inter - event times. as a novel application, we show how correlations of a few words can be used to trace topics in a logical system. one of the main goals of information theory is to understand the emergence of correlations of ideas and to identify their origins. information theory provides a robust framework for the analysis and interpretation of literary texts. in recent years, the field has witnessed an important development of its theory from a conceptual point of view. this development has been facilitated by the development of quantitative methods @xcite for detecting correlations between different sets of observables and formalisms. in the past few years, analytical methods have been used to detect correlations in various forms and to map symbolic sequences, building on the symbolic sequence and understanding their structure. in a number of cases, these methods have proved to be very useful. for example, the use of non - local mappings ( such as mappings defined after a sequence of numbers, i.e., symbolic sequences * s *, has been shown to be useful for uncovering information about the source through the statistical analysis of the encoded information. from an information theory viewpoint, it is important to understand how the origins of correlations vary as a function of the level of abstraction of the source. in this letter we report on a phenomenon that we observe for a few lines of text a _ flow _ of information from high to low levels. our observations show that correlations already establish at high levels that contextual information is preserved and encoded in the form of a bursty sequence of events. in particular, as we move down the hierarchy the number of events per letter is
we investigate different types of pairing in finite nuclei. in order to compare the experimental data and to constrain the numerical uncertainty in the accurate value of the centroid of the isgmr we use the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equation of state. in the present work we have calculated the energy function of nuclear matter with and without the rearrangement term in the quasiparticle photo - excitation process. a different approach has been used which allows us to include interactions which were not present in the original version. the most important new features obtained are that _ volume _ and _ surface _ pairing have a stronger impact on the strength function than _ mixed _ pairing, that is on the values of the energy at low momenta ( density ) and that _ no _ kind of pairing is found. as an example we report on the comparison of the strength functions of @xmath0sn with ( a ) the usual pairing - gap function and ( b ) with a mixed - pairing case. pacs : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm numerical calculations of the nuclear centre - of - mass ratio ( cgmr ). we have performed a series of calculations using two different approximations for the energy of the mean field. in particular, we have used the skyrme - dddi approximation and the quantum random phase approximation ( qrpa ), which are based on the same microscopic framework as the leptodermus formula. according to the current experimental data the most accurate experimental estimate of the cgmrs at low momentum transfer must be obtained from these calculations, while the recent experiments are consistent with the predictions of the fully self consistent hfb approach. the present results are compared with previous ones, where it is shown that the hfb self consistent calculations are unable to reproduce the experimental centroid value. the issue of centroid has been of great interest for more than two decades. during the last decades a lot of work has been done on this issue in both theoretical and experimental levels @xcite. since the mid eighties it has become clear that there is a strong sensitivity of the _ number _ of states of matter on the nucleon surface or on the volume of a nucleus. with the knowledge of the surface properties of nuclei it is possible to deduce simple properties like the mean square radius and the schwarzschild radius, from the properties of the bulk of the nucleus. on the other hand, it is
we present new vla 350@xmath0 m observations of the botes deep field obtained in 2006 with the second generation submillimeter high angular resolution camera ( sharc ii ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. follow - up deep ground - based observations with the very large array ( vla ) have been obtained in the mid - infrared ( 350 ) and longer wavelength ( 850 and 1100 ). we present a detailed characterisation of the five mid - ir - selected galaxies detected in this survey. the photometric redshifts, thermal parameters ( infrared luminosity and dust temperature ), and energy diagnostics are presented, alongside rest - frame far - infrared band photometry and model spectral energy distributions ( seds ). the 350:24 flux density redshift distribution suggests that all sources are drawn from the same ir - luminous galaxy population, and the median redshift of these galaxies is @xmath1. template fitting to the 350@xsmath0m photometry suggests that these are predominantly luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies at @xik2. we confirm the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in the works for smm j143206.11 + 341648.4, lh 350.3, and ssg 350.1, but additional mid- and far - ir emission is required to explain the data in the context of typical pah emission in these galaxies. we also present the first mid - integrated ( mir / ir ) spectra of the first discovered at 350. the shape of the spectrum is consistent with a predominantly optically red galaxy spectrum, and we find that the best - fit template includes features associated with star formation. we discuss possible methods to determine the star formation rate density and the fraction of obscured galaxies within the sample. we observe a tight correlation between the far- and mid - infra - red luminosity densities in our sample, but there is a large dispersion in the infrared colours for the two objects in which we direct the majority of the flux measurements. for the third detection in the lockman hole field, the deep 24@xday and 1.4ghz vla imaging is used to search for optical and optical counterparts. no optical counterparts are found with median signal - to - noise ratios higher than 60 %. we estimate that at least two - thirds of our sample are expected to be obscured by scattered light from an obscured source, and further deep x - ray and mid-/mid -
we give a geometric derivation of the gyroangle and eulerian angular frequencies derived from the theory of adiabatic gyromotion by liu and qin [ phys. rev. e * 81 *, 041302 ( 2009 ) ]. it is based on the geometric interpretation of the euler euler frequencies in terms of pitch angle dynamics. in this context, it provides a simple geometric framework for understanding the relation between the magnetic pitch angle and the dynamical gyrophase shift. as a result, it shows that the geometric gyrogauge one - form appears as an anholonomic function of the pitch angle when the magnetic field is space - time - dependent. in particular, when the field is gyro - symmetric at the gyration axis, its euler frequency is a constant @xmath0. when the gyrare intensity is equal to the characteristic cyclotron frequency, using this description, the oscillatory frequency is described as the angular gyrotron frequency. furthermore, the pitch - angle dynamics can be integrated into the time - variation of the magnetic - field intensity. lastly, it is shown that the existence of a generic generalized gyromy provides a physical picture of gyrohelion - plus - cell dynamics, which is also relevant for the description of oscillatory gyroherences. during the last two decades, there has been a great interest in the motion of gyroscopic objects within the magnetism community in the context of spin - orbit interactions. this is due, in part, to the fact that it plays an important role in determining the fundamental properties of spin systems, such as the spin-@xmath1 axis symmetry of the spherically symmetric top ( skyrmions ) @xcite. at the same time, it contributes to our understanding of the fundamental parameters describing the dynamics of magnetic systems. we can thus imagine an infinitesimally thin - top with a cylindrical symmetry, on the one hand, and a regular magnetic field on the other hand, which has a pendulum - like shape and a homogeneous phase - space representation. both the magnetic and the electric dipole - dipole interaction are also considered as an essential ingredient to understand the basic properties of the global spin dynamics within the condensed - matter system. the essential element in the problem is the interplay between these two - body interactions. in experiments, we have, in addition to the axisymmetric and anharmonic components, also charged particles
* purpose : * we describe a mathematical model for the stochastic cell kinetics associated with tumor cells in the early stages of tumor development, which includes the birth - death process, mutations, cell reproduction, cell differentiation, selection and fitness, and the subsequent emergence of genetic heterogeneity. the model is a computational one driven by a moran process consisting of a population of 16 different cell types, i.e. healthy cells ( 0000 ), and cancerous cells ( 1011 - 1111 ). each cell type is represented by a 4-digit binary string, with one digit in the string flipping values stochastically. the fitness of each sub - population is determined by the payoff matrix associated with the prisoner s dilemma evolutionary zero - sum game, with the winner chosen based on the criteria defined by the birth / death rates and fitness of the total cell population. in this model, cells do not change their type based on strategy, but they do change their prevalence in the population. the dynamics is then influenced by the intratumor heterogeneity of the binary string distributions throughout the cell population, with high heterogeneity driving more rapid growth. we model the system using tools from information theory and phylogenetic trees associated with clonal and sub - clonal expansions, and we quantify heterogeneity via the shannon entropy of the cellular population. * results : * the model shows that growth is driven by the interplay between tumor heterogeneity and the driver of the tumor population, and by how the initiation of mutations and fitness driving tumor growth is tracked via the gompertzian process. we show that a healthy cell population that has not yet been selected for growth and survival is more likely to be comprised of cells that have already undergone cell division, suggesting that this subclinical tumor should be more amenable ( and potentially vulnerable ) to a well planned therapeutic assault than a more mature tumor comprised ( on average ) of larger numbers of cells with more aggressive capabilities, that have undergone more aggressive mutations and that are potentially in a more advanced stage of growth. * conclusion : * our evolutionary model captures important aspects of tumor kinetics and heterogeneity at the early stage of development, and can serve as a useful surrogate for the critical developmental stage of this critical developmental phase, exhibiting similarities to other observed emergent features of soft - tissue tumor development. * keywords : * tumor cells, tumor environment, m. binkley syndrome, tumor tolerance, tumor intergenerational dynamics, genetic heterogeneity, berry phase of differentiation. * ams subject classifications : * 92c06
the long - term light curve ( lc ) of the giant of z has been reanalyzed over the last thirteen years using archival data from the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ). we find that the peak of the lc of z is driven by intense, solar - like magnetic activity that takes place quasi - cyclically in the giant star of this system. the quasi - periodic occurrence of these outbursts, that can be ascribed to the dynamo mechanism, is characteristic of the system and is a direct consequence of the fact that they are located on the white dwarf ( wd ) surface of a interacting binary system. we have found that in the past time - series of the observations of bf cyg and yy her, that the timing of the activity cycles of these two symbiotics have been the same, i.e. they have exactly the same period. this is a clear indication that the synchronous period of the orbital period of z, that is, the binary period, is a rather robust clock in the system, and is able to withstand the violent, tenfold or more variation in its output power over decades. we propose that in z and too, the observed oscillations of this kind have been caused by the introduction of a new ` ` combination nova '' event that is traveling in the atmosphere of the spinning giant. this event, that we call a ` ` ` runaway '', includes two major peaks in the radial motion of the wd, and precedes the occurrence of a great many smaller amplitude activity cycle. the high tides of z are synchronously conjugated to the spin - orbit phase of the binary by @xmath0 years. we suggest that this mode of evolution may be the same as the one of the sun, in its activity - cycle cycle, in which the tides in the sun have the same characteristics as the activity cycle in z. we have also found that one minimum of the ` ` ellipsoidal '' lc is preceding the orbital minimum by 130 d. this minimum is precursors the onset of the current activity cycle of z and preceeds also the orbital maximum.
we present the results of 4 msec chandra imaging search for x - ray counterparts to 3 lyman break galaxies ( laes ) in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) region. these objects are selected among the galex nuv channel drop - out galaxies with @xmath0 3@xmath10.7. by comparing the ratio of derived sfrs from observed line flux and x - rays, we will perform an independent measurement of the escape fraction for laes. the gaseous covering point at z = 2.1 provides the best observational evidence for low star formation rate in the universe. there are only 2 star forming laes in the ecdf - south field, both of which are poor emitters with little or no dust. among the non - detected laes, which include both w - band selected sources and those with both c - band and n - band follow - up spectra, only 1 show an unambiguousx - ray detection. the corresponding number of laes detected in each case is 7 ( 2 ) for the fuv band selected laes ( which include 1 nearby dwarf galaxies as a special case ) and 3 ( 2, 3.1 and 1.7 ) for their nuv - band - selected samples, respectively. we get an escape fraction of 3.9 % ( after accounting for dust and uncertainties ) after excluding the central region of the concordance cluster. the computed theoretical escape fraction from the stacking of the 3 laes is 3.6 ( 7 ) %. when we include the dust - corrected uv luminosity and the extinction, the predicted escape fraction becomes consistent with the theoretical models. we have not detected the nearby type 2 agn ( i.e., type 1 ), so the observed high escape fraction suggests that the high - z galaxies have high star formation rates, and that the nearby low - z star - forming galaxies are not the hide of the high z type agns.
in the minds of many scientists, the moon is a dead world. therefore, the observation of transient lunar phenomena ( tlps ) offers a fascinating opportunity for gaining insight into the physical nature of the moon s interiors, including the composition, structure and evolution. this paper investigates the statistical structure of the lunar tlp database, and how it might be used to advance our understanding of this phenomenon. particular emphasis is on the aristarchus region, home to an ancient ( @xmath0 years ) outgassing episode that is traced back to a ( likely ) different epoch than that of the main tlp source features, indicating a link between the tlp production and the mare / highland interface, the interface demarcated by rille structures, and the power - grid location of the engines that power the production of atomic and molecular opacities. the first of these components was probably generated by the imbrium crater, while the second has an antipodal origin likely due to plateaus carved out of the highlands. over a period of more than three decades, monte carlo imaging data accumulated at numerous points along the highland / highlands interface indicate a continuous and variable source feature at the position of the pkt centroid, away from the center of imbrium. as the lunar atmosphere heats up from the irradiation of the central tlp feature, the feature narrows into a series of small flares, followed by a more pronounced appearance of the feature at higher latitudes ; finally, a long - term component is seen emerging from some tlp sites. this component has a similar composition to the bulk of tlp sources, suggesting that it too is produced by an accretion event. three different physical models are proposed to explain the observed tlp behavior : ( a ) the release of trapped maria ; ( b ) the settling of mare basalt on the surface of highlands ; and ( c ) the presence of a mineral abundance well below the kreiger / prinz level. only the latter model can be tested quantitatively, and it is strongly supported by the data.
we present composite spectra of the stellar populations in the cl1604 supercluster at @xmath0, consisting of 525 spectroscopically - confirmed members of the four main groups and clusters of the system and eight groups of galaxies that comprise it, to investigate the formation and evolution of the red sequence and the blue horizontal branch in large scale structures at high redshift. we find that this sample of galaxies comprises a significant fraction of the blue - cloud population in both the cluster a and the group systems, with a majority of bright, intermediate - mass blue galaxies in the center of cluster a. the composite spectral properties of these blue galaxies indicate that they are undergoing mass buildup at early times, with bright, low- to moderate - mass members apparently transitioning from the group red sequence to the cluster red sequence. in contrast, the composite spectrum of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in the complex in which the majority of massive galaxies reside, shows no strong signatures of star formation at the highest redshifts. this suggests that the processing of cluster galaxies at high mass levels operates on a much longer time scale than that required for normal star formation to significantly affect the cluster properties, and is likely to be primarily driven by early quenching of low - mass galaxies. in the most massive cluster in the system ( cluster a ), we observe little evidence for star - formation in the cluster blue galaxies, suggesting that the characteristic mass transitioning on which star formation is primarily taking place is not large enough to account for the spectral signatures of cluster membership. in cluster d, a cluster known to be extremely unrelaxed and one of the most isolated in the local universe, appears to be undergoing steady build - up of its stellar mass following an epoch of cluster - specific star formation. we also present an analysis of the morphological and spectroscopic properties of the member galaxies of the lowest redshift cluster ( cluster d ), which is dominated by quiescent early - type galaxies ( etgs ). based on the color of these member galaxies, we determine that they stand out because of their unusually blue colors and may be the bright analogs of the clusters with unusually red colors for their stellar masses. we discuss the implications of these results for models of cluster specific evolution and clustering. in addition, we present a large - scale sample of high-@xmath1, field - to - field color and morphology data from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ), covering the
we address the problem of the entanglement among the transition - temperature states ( tls s ) of a system undergoing a non - markovian evolution. working within the dimer structure of the model, we study the dynamics of the tls chain under the influences of various envilibriums. when interacting with a common set of environmental modes, we find a logarithmic behavior in the sense that there is a recurrence peak at temperature @xmath0. a similar result is obtained when investigating tls with a squeezed vacuum ensemble, where the recurrence depends on the number of excitations available in the oscillators. our study points to the existence of multiple environmental preparations and sets a benchmark for the identification of their characteristics in a variety of physical systems. the notion of quantum state, developed to describe the macroscopic evolution of a many - body system, has been extended to the description of the microscopic processes embodied in chemical reactions and in atomic and molecular systems @xcite. in this context, the emergence of quantum states has been described and studied in detail in the framework of linear response theory, with a particular focus on finding the quantum - mechanical equivalent to the classical states. a quantum state is characterized by the universal energy neither in the thermodynamic nor in the thermal state and hence has received a great deal of attention in the literature. one of the most distinguishing features of a well - structured quantum system is its _ quantum state _ ( qss ), that is, the quantum state that is independent from its local environment and which has a local probability of being at the center of the whole system_. while several attempts have been made to characterize the qss of a single system, so far there is no consensus about the qualitatively most important qss. an important exception is the field of quantum information, where both theory and experience have been studied in the past. in particular, the literature on quantum information has been stacked thick on the subject, which often fails to point to a definite evolution or even change of state underlying the data processing. nevertheless, the state of the system embodied by a single quantum state has been the focus of an intensive research activity in the area of quantum computation and the characterization of physical evolution. on the other hand, the issue of the role of environment has received comparatively less attention, except in the case of a truly microscopic system, where environmental environments are typically not expected to be taken into account. in the present work we take a step in this direction by addressing the question whether the bipartite dynamics
we present kinematic and morphological evidence that supports the existence of a weak stellar bar and a nuclear starburst in two edge - on sc galaxies with boxy bulges. the data obtained during a spectroscopic survey of active galaxies with extended line - emitting regions ( isophotes, fabry - perot spectra ) reveal unambiguously a bar potential in ngc 3079 and ngc 4388. at the spatial resolution of the two - dimensional velocity field, the [ o iii ] @xmath035848, 6583 emission - line velocity field is well described by a combination of ( 1 ) a boxy peanut - shaped bulge and a ( boxy ) stellar bar rotating with an axis of ( 160@xmath1 ), ( 2 ) a complex of several filaments extending several kpc above the galactic plane, and ( 3 ) several short bars extending from the nucleus out to, and possibly beyond, the ionized gas disk. the peculiarities of these features, the boxiness of the peanut shape and the strength of the bar, the total mass and gas mass - fraction of the bulge, and the presence of gas streaming along peculiar orbits are the main characteristics that allow us to identify the ` ` bar potential '' in these two galaxies. although both galaxies host a nuclear agn, the properties of the nuclear source suggest that the source is most likely to be a low - luminosity agn rather than a stellar bar. the axisymmetric, tilted, non - zero - velocity gas disk model ( tremaine & tremaine 1987 ; bahcall 1989 ) can not account for our observations. we therefore conclude that the nature of the stellar bar in these galaxies is more consistent with the shape of their central galaxies. the gas that is emitted by the agn in both galaxies is well mixed with that of the starburst material. it is likely that most of the gas associated with the nuclear activity is in a co - rotating disk or in a disk, but we can not rule out a nuclear origin of the observed gas.
we develop a theory of spin pumping of magnetic monopoles in fermi liquid with precessing magnetization in adjacent normal metal layers using nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) expressions which take into account microscopic time - dependent hamiltonians for fermionic spin - diffusion in the adiabatic regime, nonlocal spin - orbit correlations ( soc ) in the noninteracting phase - coherent systems, as well as the effect of interfacial rashba soc. the microscopic hamiltonian which is tailored to account for nanoscale thickness of f layers contains finite - size tight - binding lattice attached to semi - infinite ideal ( disorder and interaction free ) n leads, while the corresponding thin insulating barrier is measured using the number of atomic monolayers. in this framework, we find a two - step process for obtaining time - averaged total charge current across the n leads of the junctions where the first step consists of pumping of pure spin current into the inner f layers and the second step involves the filtering of non - pumped spin current in the outer ones. the magnitude of pump spin current and its sign and sign of voltage signal in f@xmath0i@x0n junctions is computed quantum - mechanically via the brouwer scattering formula which enters into the latter via a double fourier transform. the formula which is found numerically allows us to calculate numerically such pump currents and the corresponding dc voltage signals in various open circuits. we derive closed - form expressions for each of these two pumped charge currents in terms of the spin - density - wave function and the microwave photons absorbed or emitted by the f layers in contact with the tunnel barrier i.e., @xmath1. the formulas which are then numerically solved to obtain quantized quantities of dc voltage signal and temperature of the pump are also applied to understand critical current switching in experiments. we find that thermally - driven microwave - radiation induced spin - transfer torque - driven magnetization oscillations in ferromagnetic metals at room temperature and pressure, and at high temperatures can be used to investigate non - perturbative behavior of spin current pumping in magnetic multilayers containing f or n layers. also, we demonstrate that the recently - developed momentum - space mott - insulator - junction ( mtj ) models in which the f layer is believed to be a critical current turnoff can be exploited to investigate spin pumping phenomena in mtjs, and propose a novel multi - terminal device required for both negf and scattering theory analysis.
we show that the three flavor loff phase, due to its chromomagnetic stability, is a serious candidate for the true vacuum at moderate densities, and therefore it could be present in the core of compact stars. + pacs number(s ) : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm numerical solutions of the qcd equations have opened an attractive area for the study of matter - antimatter interactions. in particular, the so - called deep qcd ( dm ) school has attracted a great deal of attention,@xcite, for its potential applications in qcd and condensed matter physics. on the other hand, there are many open problems, including the question of the validity of the dm school as a reference state for qcd theories. this paper will discuss these issues, by presenting our results in ref. @xcite. one of the most important qcd problems is the search for a qcd phase that is stable under qcd, i.e., has a gap in the condensate. for a long time there has been no experimental evidence for the existence of such a phase, although qcd has been suggested to be a possibility in a variety of systems. recently some experimental evidence has been put forward, which may be related to heavy ion collisions. moreover, theoretically clean qcd phases seem to be more generic than qcd ones. in this paper we summarize the current status of such qcd candidates, with emphasis on the ones with the clean phase tested so far. we will then present our results and speculate on the future prospects of this contribution, in particular the possibility of including the @xmath0 phase in our qcd studies. * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * + * desy 02 - 049 march 2002 @xs * search for quark loff phases in deuterium - superfluid reactions * + k. rajagopal@xmath1 and m. s. teich + _ department of physics and astronomy, the george washington university, washington dc 20052, usa _ + m. foile + _ dept of physics & astronomy, university of michigan, ann arbor, mi 48109 - 1120, u.s.a. + e - mail : k.m.tokaki@gmail.com
we examine interference alignment ( ia ) and rate - tuples for @xmath0-user mimo gaussian interference channel ( gic ) with finite constellation inputs, in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime. specifically, the precoders that achieve ia are considered to be ccsc optimal. a high snr approximation for the rate tuples achieved by treating interference as noise at the receivers is derived. based on this approximation, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions exist for all direct and cross channel gains, as the channel gains do not vary with time. _ as a measure of optimality of linear precoding for the finite constellation input case, we introduce the notion of _ constellation saturation capacity _ ( ccsc ). when all the transmitters have a single antenna, for which the phase - space of the interference channel is known, and each transmitter-@xmath1 has at most one antenna, the maximum rate achieved by the sum - rate tuple at receiver rx-1 is given by mutual information between the input generated by tx-@axmath1, and the output at receiver hz / h, respectively. it is observed that a precoder that satisfies ccsc optimality will tend to ccsc for transmit - receiver phase space which is well within the reach of the current ia results. the purpose of this paper is to provide a global algorithm to maximize the siso - sum - capacity obtained by finitely encoding the constellation constellation in terms of a non - linear precoder. the novel algorithm is of the form of _ gradient - ascent based _ algorithm, where the number of antennas at each transmitter and the total number of bits / h used in the precoder is integer. simulation results indicate considerable improvement in the ergodic sum - rtg with precoder over that obtained using the ia solution of @xcite. moreover, the proposed algorithm is found to be more efficient than the current algorithm under the assumption of constant channel coefficients. for a k - user mimo gic with all single antenna gains, this result is np - hard in general, in contrast with the gaussian input alphabet case.
in this paper, we study intertwining operators among twisted modules associated to not - necessarily - commutative automorphisms of a vertex operator algebra. by twisted modules we mean ( generalized or logarithmic ) twisted modules of arbitrary genus. they come from chiral vertex operators in physics and were introduced by frenkel, lepowsky and meurman @xcite. they have been studied systematically in the literature and played an important role in the representation theory of vertex operator algebras and two - dimensional conformal field theories. if the vertex operator subalgebra fixed by the automorphism group of an algebra satisfies suitable conditions ( for example, the three conditions in conjecture [ twisted - int - op ] ), then one possible choice of such a structure large enough for our purpose is the intertwining operator algebra formed by the modules and intertwined operators for the fixed - point vertex operator seeding. however, the assumption that these suitable conditions hold is in fact a main conjecture that we have to prove first. because of this, the assumptions used to derive the conjectures are often themselves the most difficult parts of the computations required to prove them. to prove a theorem or a proof of an interesting theorem, however, in order to obtain a proof, we first have to work with multivalued analytic functions with preferred branches. such functions are the kind of ones we study in this paper. we prove that for @xmath0, there exists a subtraction procedure to obtain such functions on a region of the same region, that is to say, we can take the form of decomposition functions on branches of the single - valued branch on the region and divide the functions on that branch into two separate regions, respectively. we also give a careful analysis of the relations between these two subsets of functions and vertex operators and show that the corresponding functions in the subtraction sequence do not violate the contragredient functor on the category of twisted modules. 2.0 cm * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 60k35, 60j20, 60k25, 82c22, 34c20, 34j50, 34m05
we have studied the selection criteria for finding quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the chinese large sky area multi - object fibre spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ), which are both reflecting schmidt telescopes with 4 meter effective telescope and 4000 fibres. the sdss quasar candidate selection method based on the two degree field ( 2df ) survey was mainly selected based on their optical colours derived from the photometric data. the results are applied to a small sdss / ukidss / edr quasar / star sample and a sample of the variable sources in sdss stripe 82. the main aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of the quasar selection in both surveys in the colour - colour diagrams with the aim to see whether there is any systematic difference in selecting the most redshifted quasar candidates. it has been demonstrated that it is much more efficient to select lower redshift objects ( @xmath0 ) in the 2df survey than to select higher redshift ones in the lamost survey ( redshift between 2 and 3 ). in addition, the multi - band colours are crucial for the photometrically reliable photometric redshift estimations of qu asars. we have applied the above selection criteria to a large sdss sample with both sdss and ultraviolet k - band photometry, and have found that the combination of sdss uv photometry with the optical photometry for galaxies can provide a more efficient selection method for quasar identification. the photo - z accuracy is estimated to be improved by a factor of 2 - 3 if sdss photometry is included in the analysis, while it can be improved to 85 % or higher if galex uv data is included as well. these results are useful for the forthcoming large lamost quasar survey, which will operate from 2015 to june. lamost has completed its construction of its quasar catalogue in 2008, and will provide reliable redshifts for the large quasar sample in its first regular phase for the ongoing and the future surveys. # 1to 0pt#1
we present results from spitzer observations of the agn in two @xmath0160 square arcmin@xmath1 fields, the chandra deep fields north and south, obtained as part of the goods legacy program. the observed 3.6 - 8 micron and mips 24 micron fluxes for the goods agn, combined with the x - ray and infrared number counts from the iras and iso surveys, provide a highly complete, relatively unbiased view of agn at cosmologically - significant distances. we find that agn contribute at least 8 % and possibly 5 % to the infrared background observed by chandra, namely at least 4.7 % and 5.5 %, respectively at 3 - 6 @xfig3 m, 8 - 5 % and 4.1 % at 8 and 24, and their presence is likely to be significant at these luminosities. the deep chandra observations, together with the mips data, permitted us to determine the relative importance of different agn components in the observed agn number counts and, thus, the infrared - to - far infrared luminosity ratio. taking a galaxy - dependent host galaxy luminosity function from the deep iso study of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, our results suggest that the brightest agn reside in low - luminosity, low - redshift galaxies. we performed a simple power - law fit to the observed distribution of the temperature of the host galaxies and the average ratio of unobscured to obscured agn is found to be 0.35, which is much lower than the average value of 0.25 derived from iras surveys. this result can be explained by the fact that both agn and galaxies contribute significantly to the extragalactic infrared background, at least according to population synthesis models, in the local universe. we also find no significant correlation between the observed trend of the ratio of infrared to far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity and x - rays - to-infrared luminosity. however, covering the complete goods sample, we find a significant spread in the inferred agn luminosity range, ranging from a factor of two to a few percent.
we present results from a series of numerical simulations that follow the formation of a virgo - sized cluster of galaxies. the simulations are of a wide range of numerical resolutions and include a variety of physical processes : cooling of gas, star formation, supernova feedback, and gravitational lensing. we examine the effects of several parameters on the evolution of the cluster, including the mass and force resolution, the degree to which non - gravitational physical processes are included, the presence of particle noise in the simulations, and the baryonic fraction within the central @xmath0. the three - dimensional radial profiles of a number of physical properties of the simulated clusters are presented here. these are the total and dark matter distributions inversion, the circular velocity and gas entropy profiles in 4.1, the x - ray surface brightness and temperature profiles in 5.2, and discuss the implications of these results for the physics of cluster formation. in our simulations, the final cluster mass is an order of magnitude greater than the final virialized object ; the cluster extends to a radius that is twice the spatial resolution scale for a given density profile. the force resolution begins on scales twice the gravitational softening length and the dark matter and total mass profiles also flatten. however, in the _ lowres _ simulation and for the _ adiabatic _ simulation both components agree to within a factor of two and the flattening continues beyond that radius. the central baryon fraction is reduced significantly with the inclusion of a hydrodynamic component and the resulting cooling of the gas is extensive. the results of the _ cool+sf _ simulations are consistent with the well - known sunyaev - zeldovich effect in the cumulative mean cluster mass. the final mass and stellar mass profiles are also well fitted by simple recipes. these recipes require the gas to cool and form stars, prior to the onset of the supernova phase which halts the cooling and restricts the star formation in the early stages of the simulation. the late stage star formation is accelerated by the simultaneous merging of subcomponents. the result is a steep central cusp and a loss of central pressure, owing to the simultaneous cooling and star formation. this can be understood in terms of the assumption that the early galaxy clusters were formed from a large number of smaller clusters. galaxies : clusters : general galaxies : formation cosmology : theory
we present a new measurement of the lifetime of the @xmath0 meson using data recorded by the opal detector at lep. we have used a sample of 705 million simulated b - flavored hadron decays, together with over one million collected during the 1996 - 1997 years, to infer the properties of the spin-1/2 meson in the decay of b - hadrons produced in the decays of charmonium and anti - charm hadrons. we find, for the first time, that the mean lifetime is approximately 1.6 gev. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * measurement of @xcite of the age of the hadron @xcitons : the lifetime + of the two - meson meson + in the decaying channels @x math.pez. nuovo cim. * # 1 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) # 2 hep - ph/9610437 + u.s.a. waugh, t.d. anderson, m. aspelmeyer, r. arcidiacono, j. g. greentree, l. ammar, a. baring, d. bhattacharyya, w.b. barwick, g. besson, c. beattie, p. beaudoin, n. broussard, h. biakowska, b. blume, s. bettelli, o.biebel, i.j. bloodworth, j.- p. bias, y. becka, alexander,8 v. borges, jr. robertson, k. alimujiang, v. andrzeja sotana, f. baumert, l.- m. botje, jones, r.- a. bouchta, a.- j. korolkova, olszewski, b.- s. choi, m.- k. chen, vogelaar,8 a. h. konopacky, c.- w. kellermann,8 t. m. karliner,6 b. e. kasparian,6 p. k. kass,8 j. j. oneill,8 s. kotislava
we describe two different methods for stacking sub - threshold _ first _ survey images, both using snapshot data and applying them to the data in the context of the deepest large - area sky survey, _ first_. the first method allows for the first time to determine the mean properties of radio - loud quasars as a function of redshift and optical color in a mathematically simple way. we use the photometric mean of each image pixel to establish the mean flux density in the innermost @xmath0 of the radio images, thereby determining the mean radio source properties at very faint flux density levels unachievable by direct observations. the second method is to apply a highly nonlinear ` clean'radio image stacking algorithm to these undersampled images, subject to the constraint that the signal - to - noise ratio and noise level of the images must be similar. we provide a detailed analysis of the noise characteristics of the stacked images, including an accurate measurement of the low - level noise and a statistical distinction between broad absorption line ( bal ) and non - bal objects. we find that the median value of the effective power - law radio source flux density stokes the noise, and is insensitive to redshift, color, and type of source ( artificial or real ) sources inserted into the images. hence the recovered median value can be used as representative of the mean for the population of sources with flux densities fainter than the typical field rms. we discuss the implications of these results for studies of quasar radio emission at radio powers, including the distribution of radio loudness and mean radio flux density, broadening of the qso population, the radio dominance of balqsos, and the division between radio - bright and radio - faint qsos. we also examine the duty cycle of broad absorption, finding that it is concurrent with a period of strong bal emission, which is correlated with strength of the bal absorption lines. this suggests that the presence of bal is a robust indicator of the orientation of the jet axis in quasar emission. we conclude with a brief demonstration of how broad absorption lines are found to be correlated with low - radio - luminosity objects, and our results can be readily applied to other quasar catalogs.
cross - sections and angular distributions for hadronic and lepton pair final states in collisions at centre - of - mass energies near 189 gev are presented and compared with the predictions of the standard model. these results are used to obtain limits on new physics as described by four - fermion contact interactions or by the exchange of a new particle with mass @xmath0-parity violation. we also present results of a search for the indirect effects of the gravitational interaction in extra dimensions on the and final states. in this framework atomic physics violation experiments can place 95 % confidence level limits on the coupling as a function of the sneutrino mass. the measurements of hadronic cross - section and angular distribution are compared to the prediction of the kaluznyi et al. ( 2005 ) monte carlo generator. the ratios of measured cross - sections for hadrons, muon and tau pairs are compared with theoretical predictions which include interference. with the higher luminosity and higher statistics available at 189 we have been able to reduce the experimental systematic errors in some channels. a comparison between results from this study and those from the zfitter and topaz0 programs shows that the alibaba data are in very good agreement with standard model expectations. we repeat our measurement of the electromagnetic coupling constant, and include the higher energy data. the combined data from the two programs provide an important improvement over previous analyses. if the energy scale is independent of the particle mass and the mass of the higgs boson, and if the particle is restricted to low - mass hadronic loops, the running of the coupling constant is shown to be 1.1 - 1.4 %. limits on extended models are also presented. a maximum likelihood fit of the model predictions is used to measure the energy dependence of the z mass. this gives a bound on the effective planck scale in the space with extra dimensions of 0.0 - 2.0 tev. finally we present measurements of forward - backward asymmetries for the leptonic final states and the dependence of this on the initial- and final - state photon number, and discuss the prospects of using these measurements to define a new energy scale.
we present detailed theoretical studies of the ionising spectra and stellar populations of population iii stars and their relations to the underlying massive star formation history, initial mass function ( imf ) and the star formation rate ( sfr ). extensive sets of non - lte model stellar atmospheres appropriate for metal - free stellar tracks have been constructed with the _ tlusty _ code ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ) for plane - parallel atmospheres. the consideration of various poorly constrained physical processes ( mass loss, non coherent electron scattering etc. ) allows us to explore the influence of a wide range of the stellar imfs and sfr on the spectral properties of pop iii objects. for this purpose we have calculated stellar spectra, integrated stellar populations, photon fluxes, metal production etc., and the flux in the lyman - werner band dissociating h@xmath0. detailed fit formulae are given for stars from 5 to 1000, with stellar masses from 80 to 1000. we find that : ( 1 ) mass loss has a significant impact on the spectra of relatively massive stars ( @xmath1 0.5 ), ( 2 ) due to the rapid redward evolution of the most massive stars off the zero age main sequence, ( 3 ) the photometric properties of the hottest ( 1000 ) stars are modified by their short lifetimes, ( 4 ) the he ii recombination line luminosities are decreased, and ( 5 ) the oxygen / carbon ratio ( o / c ) is significantly overestimated. for young bursts and in particular for constant sfr, nebular continuous emission dominates the spectrum, while for older objects the equivalent widths of the lines are significantly smaller than found in earlier studies. a ` ` single, fixed '' imf is considered only for pop iii stars with masses between 500 and 1000. if massive stars form part of a family of ` ` ` pair creation '' stars ( i.e. first stars with a short lifetime ) formed at early times in the history of the universe then their spectra should be significantly different from that of the less luminous ( 500 to 1000 ) first luminous objects. this would explain the modest si / c overabundance found in some of the studies. alternative imfs leading to strong mass loss are also discussed.

the assembly of virus capsids into cylindrical shells is a fundamental, fundamental process in cell biology. despite decades of study, however, the structural details of the immature particle, the maturation pathway, and the assembly of the mature capsid remain unknown. current models for assembly, including single - stranded rna, dna, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, remain limited by their ability to describe the complex organelles of virus genomes. here, we describe a novel approach to model assembly that combines aspects of gillespie - type and particle - based simulations. in a first class of models, subunits of the nascent ` immature'particle interact through pair potentials to drive assembly toward an ordered low - energy structure, the capsid consists of a disordered lattice of uncleaved gag proteins and surrounded by a lipid bilayer. the latter is derived from the plasma membrane of the host cell during budding of the virus from the cell. upon maturation, gag polyproteins are cleaved into three portions, the matrix ( ma ), capsid ( ca ), and nucleocapsid ( nc ) proteins, which constitute different components of the fully infectious virion. in the second class, the immature spherical shell completely disassembles after gag cleavage, resulting in a ` de novo'assembly of ca into the cone. the ca shell forms a ` fullerene cone'consisting of 7 pentamers at the tip and 5 at the base, with the latter being the highest surface curvature of the whole structure. molecular dynamics flexible fitting ( mdff ) simulations of this structure have shown that the ca proteins can assemble into this unusual structure via electrostatics. this results in a 4-dimensional network of interacting subunits, in which ca proteins serve as the binding sites for ps binding, and ca proteins and nc proteins assemble into the complex c4-helix. these simulations are enabled by a newly - introduced algorithm called markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ), which is based on the concept of markovian ensemble dynamics developed by zuckerman _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 104 *, 104301 ( 2006 ) ]. despite their simplicity, these coarse - grained models reveal a wealth of novel features, including subcellular localization of capsid subunits and coordinated translation and translation between different components. in addition, the simulations reveal a surprising lack of knowledge of conformational conformational changes during the growth
* purpose : * recently a new kagome lattice material with a nonmagnetic a site was discovered, featuring corner - sharing triangles in two - dimensions, which controls the interactions between the triangles through partial ion substitution. it is a possible candidate for the quantum spin liquid phase transition. to investigate the properties of this new structure, we synthesized and studied two branches of the rare earth tkl family with different re ions, a@xmath0re@xentalite bacu_u_bacu[o_u[n_t_zn,o_z zn,zb ] and vesignieite re baccub[mo_b_z sb[ao_b bac, sb sb mgo / zno ]. + * methods : * the tkl is a variant of the pyrochlore lattice based on a triangular structure in which the triangular layers in the pyrchlore structure along the axis are substituted by anti - ferromagnetic ionic ions, i.e., @xmath1 sb / pr. the structure changes the interlayer separation for the tkls with larger re ions relative to those in the mg branch. as described in our previous work @xcite, with heisenberg spins in _ mggd _, the system exhibits a long - range ordering ( lro ) at 1.65 k which is responsible for zn / ho site disorder in the transition metal ( re ) layer. a similar behavior has been observed in the ca - re branch of the o - re family, where site disorder gives rise to 3 - 5 % a / re site disorder for re = pr, nd, gd, tb, dy, ho, er and yb. besides, a mild site disorder is observed in re = yb, resulting in a fragile re - spin ice state. by replacing mg with zn, we show that the chemical pressure has little effect on the magnetic properties of tkl spin liquids with large re ions. we do observe an increase of the site - disorder for the smaller re kaluza - klein layers with increasing zn replacement, leading to changes of the low temperature ground state of ( re = mg, zn ) spin liquids compared to re = re, which is expected to convert to a spin - charge ordered state in the qsl phase. thus, it is essential to search for re - ordered compounds with tunable
we review the analysis of the photometric metallicity distribution of late - type stars in the solar neighbourhood and find that recent spectroscopic datasets show good agreement with our own finding ( haywood 2001 ) that there is no deficit of metal poor stars relative to the closed - box model. using scale height corrections to account for the contribution of the thick disc, we re - determine the intrinsic dispersion in effective temperature from ( b - v)[fe / h ] @xmath0 0.15 to 0.20 dex, with a high dispersion at all ages. we derive a corrected amd, which although not optimised, is quite different from the previously cited studies ( nordstrm et al. 2002, feltzing & lewko 2005 ). main arguments for our re - analysis are based on the increasing degree of homogenisation of the age - metallicities relation in the recent years, the existence of a young metal - poor population with decreasing age between 10 and 5 gyrs, and the presence of old, metal - rich objects in the same sample. specifically, it is shown that the recent, significant increase in the proportion of young, metal rich objects ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 0.5 dex ) as a function of age helps to alleviate the g - dwarf problem, whereas the lack of such objects at ages greater than 3 gyrs is a direct consequence of the increased proportion of stars with thick, metallicities ( assuming 250 pc scale height for the thin disc ). in addition, thick disc stars are found to contribute about 15 - 15 % to the compilation of the ages of solar neighbourhood stars, showing that the amd is not biased at the level. our results, based on local data, are consistent with recent independent studies of the recent stellar evolution of the galactic disc, but the most up - to - date data do nt lead to a definitive conclusion. before the significance of our results can be discussed in detail, we wish to comment on a recent trend in the radial profile of the local metal - enrichment with increasing age. ii @th # 1 galaxies : nuclei galaxies : dwarf galaxies : kinematics and dynamics instrumentation : photometry
we present a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of galaxies in the fields of fifteen x ray luminous clusters in the redshift range @xmath0, selected from the emss survey. the sample is luminosity limited, and in general, the lowest signal - to - noise ratio is better than 1.0. we focus on three spectral indices d4000, which is sensitive to star formation that took place up to 1 gyr ago ; and @xday, which indicates current star formation activity. we compare our data to the model predictions of fioc & rocca volmerange ( 1997 ), and bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ). the radial trends within the cluster sample are consistent with a continuous age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently for the outermost galaxies than for the central galaxies. we define k+a galaxies as those with recently terminated star formation, and we find that they represent 2.1 % of the cluster galaxies and 0.1% of the field galaxies. for our cluster sample, the field sample drawn from the foreground and background of these rich clusters may be unusual in some way ; results are generally consistent with the field samples of other groups. we also find that there are significant differences between the field and cluster samples ; results which are not likely to be explained by the simple weighting function used. attempting to correct for this effect, we find the true fraction of k+as galaxies to be only ( 2 ) percent in the cluster and field, and 1.7 % in the field. we conclude that any galaxy that has undergone a starburst within the last 2 gyr should have its star formation truncated, and should not remain active longer than a few hundred million years. the fraction of field galaxies classified a+em is twice as large as the cluster fraction. thus, the cluster environment does not appear to be responsible for generating these galaxy types, whether or not they are starbursts. we suggest that the b o effect, first discussed by kauffmann ( 1995 ), may be a consequence of the different morphs used to characterize these galaxies, rather than an evolutionary effect.
x - ray absorption fine structure ( xanes ) is an important tool for studying both the real and the electronic structure of solids. the popular lippman - schwinger ( lp ) description of xanes can be reduced to a discrete probability density @xmath0 which describes the probability density of electrons participating in the scattering of the core x - ray photon by neighboring atoms. the lp can be used to explore the structure of materials with respect to the solid state structure. in particular, it provides a proper way to evaluate the photoelectron probability density based on the absorption spectra. here we present a general analysis of the problem. the main goal is to explore how the choice of the atomic potential determines the resulting probability density. we show that the pre - peak at the center ( ti ) of a xane spectrum is a specific example of a proper candidate for the difference probability and that all the other peaks are, in fact, parts of the same peak. we explore the physics that gives rise to such xanes spectra and find that the existence of such spectra is not just a high - order effect, but that they can be associated with the spatial localization of the xanes electron which is seen by xas. for a broad class of materials, including liquid metals and semiconductors, there is a vast number of potential sites for xanes to be found. it is however difficult to identify the true nature of these sites and the relative importance of their contribution to the absorption spectrum. to get a deeper insight into the subject, one has to borrow ideas from statistical physics. the well - known density of states ( dos ) is usually considered as a consequence of the energy - dependent photoabsorption effect. this is due to the fact that the probability which would correspond to a single isolated atom just like the exafs can be extracted from it by subtracting from it the atomic part ( edge of and on the whole ti _ xafs ). this yields a dos - like probability density which differs from by assuming a -independent or ` ` unidirectional '' photoexron diffraction.
the phenomenon of cosmic ray bursts ( grbs ) dates back to at least @xmath0 years before the satellite was launched. grbs are believed to originate from two different processes : the birth of a supernova ( sn ) and the formation of a black hole ( bh ). the cases of the two processes are often referred to as _ short _ and _ long _ grbs, respectively. in this work, we address the issue of the rates of occurrence of these two sub - classes, which have been identified as the most important class of grbs with both long and short bursts. we estimate the local rates of the three of these classes : the _ magnetars _ ( mrs ), the _ supernovae _ ( sne ), and the _ bunar - grfs _ ( bdhne ). since the sn is presumed to be rare, only a small fraction of the long bursts actually take place. the mrs, on the other hand, are much more numerous and have been observed for a longer time, indicating that they are more likely to originate in low - metallicity progenitor systems. the onset of the bh process in ns is characterized by a high luminosity and an extended duration followed by a sharp drop in luminosity. the presence of a luminous bh leads to an overall hardening of the grb light curves. in addition, the onset and abrupt thickness of the emission appear to be closely related to the redshift. we have recently proposed a new hybrid sub - class of ultrashort grbs ( urfs ), which, as explained in @xcite, can originate during the further evolution of two ns binary systems leading to bh formation. here we present and discuss some of the latest results within the fireshell " model on the possible presence or absence of a bh in ns.

many plant cells grow anisotropically, which makes it surprising that conformal maps apply to leaves. however, in the lateral stages of the growth of lateral plant organs, such as leaves, cotyledons, or sepals, it appears either that cellular growth is roughly isotropic, or that growth direction fluctuates spatially and temporally. in any case, the distribution of leaves is not determined by the strain tensor at the granular level. here, we use a conformal map between initial and final leaf contours to directly compare the observed distribution of displacement fields around a leaf, both measured and calculated, with the large scale patterns of growth in area. we thereby established a tool to study growth dynamics of almost planar two dimensional tissues in a developing organism. in future, we plan to apply this method to a wider range of plant species, including leaves with intricate shapes. 1. growth is usually not captured by the area in which leaves emerge from a plane @xcite. instead, most research on plants is focused on the structure of the leaf root or leaf leaf, as it is the most direct assessment of growth. nevertheless, many aspects of plant growth are poorly understood. for example, it is not clear under what conditions growth is localised, or whether localised patterns can be predicted from a single cell s total size. to address these questions, we model the dynamics of cellular growth by means of a particle image velocity algorithm. to investigate this, we theoretically explore the growth in the area of a conformally map containing only first and final order growth modes. this approach, however, is limited by the fact that leaves already formed much earlier than the time when the image is viewed at distance from the ccd. therefore, to translate observed dynamics into growth, we employ an additional higher order term in the conformal mapping. we show that the additional term is of general importance, and can be used to correct for the rotational degree of freedom of leaves. 2. when leaves acquire their shapes during growth, the direction of growth is not directly reflected in the observed displacement fields. this is true even though the leaves grown are not a mere dilation. the effect is reduced if leaves adopt a more convex shape during growth. for tobacco plants, we expect our approach to be applicable only to leaves that have grown sufficiently long, and where the shape is particularly important. 3. when the effects of rotation and translation are accounted for, we find that the shape of a leaf s contour is not only
we present deep multiwavelength optical observations in the b and r bands of the central region of the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) core, covering an area of 2 deg@xmath0. the b - r galaxy luminosity function ( lf ), which describes the number of galaxies per unit volume as function of luminosity, shows a clear bimodality, with the faint end being well described by a schechter function. however, both the bright - end and faint - end lfs show mild trends with environment. we find that the bright end slope, @xmath1, is strongly correlated with environment, becoming steeper at high density regions, and is independent of the richness of the cluster to which the galaxy is bound, confirming that mechanisms such as merging or suffocation are playing a dominant role in transforming galaxies, rather than harassment or ram pressure stripping. the lf for the ssc core shows a central region that is characterized by a steep cluster potential and a high density of galaxies. dividing the galaxies into red and blue according to their location with respect to the colour magnitude relation, the lfs for the red sequence and the blue galaxy populations respectively show a very different behaviour. in fact, in regions characterized by intermediate- to low - density environments, the red galaxy lfs are consistent with a star formation rate that does not vary with the density, whereas the blue galaxies represent a population that has never been through the cluster centre and therefore has never experienced the tidal stripping and tidal triggering of star formation. in addition, galaxy harassment and ram - pressure stripping have virtually no effect on the local galaxy density, suggesting that the responsible processes for the transformation of field galaxies are simply related to the cluster s potential and the intracluster medium. the effects of the environment on the galaxy population are investigated by calculating the luminosity functions using a maximum likelihood technique and comparing the derived lfs with theoretical predictions.

we describe the code dngr, developed at double negative, for creating general relativistically correct images of black holes and accretion disks. we use it to produce images of what a camera orbiting a fast - spinning black hole in the equatorial plane of a galaxy, in the vicinity of a black hole or a wormhole, would look like in the gravitational lensing context. the intersection of the celestial sphere with the primary, secondary, and tertiary caustics of the camera s past light cone is considered a 2-dimensional surface. we compute the shapes of the curves of light rays that wrap around the black hole s equatorial shadow edge, from which we create and annihilate pair of image pairs on the secondary critical curve. we discuss in detail how the shapes and sizes of the images depend on the angle between the cloud and the camera, the way light beams are oriented along the ray path, and on the planet s spin - down rate. we also explore the effect of doppler and gravitational frequency shifts, shift - induced colour and brightness changes, and camera lens flare. we describe our images of a star field with three different disk models : an infinitely thin, planar disk, with colour and optical thickness defined by an artist s image, a three - dimensional ` ` voxel '' model, and a model with detailed texture added by modifying a commercial renderer. we find that the disk s appearance depends sensitively on the value of the gravitational frequency shift. in particular, for close - up shots, there is just one image of the plane between the two critical curves, and there are infinitely many images between the first and second critical curves. as the camera moves out from the pole of the disk and the image pairs are annihilated. we discover that the shape of the third caustic is essentially the same as the first two, though its size and shape vary from cloud to cloud. from a qualitative point of view, the existence of multiple image pairs is helpful for understanding how stars during lensing by a hypothetical wormhole would appear as a shadowed background source or lensed galaxy far away, and we describe in detail the choices of which of these choices are most important.

we present the discovery of two new transiting extrasolar planets with masses that are similar to that of saturn. the planets are located at a projected separation of @xmath0=18@xmath1, and have orbital parameters that are slightly less than that of jupiter. the low - density planets are discovered in the hungarian - made automated telescope network ( hatnet ; *??? * ) survey, which has now covered approximately 14 % of the sky. the follow - up spectroscopic observations are made with the 2mass and tass instruments aboard the palomar - synchrotron telescope at the william herschel telescope, and confirm that both planets are orbited by close - in giant planets. we model the light curves using the algorithms of the hatnet algorithm, and use the empirical radial velocity ( rv ) and atmospheric parameters derived from 2mass spectra to determine their core masses. we find that the core masses of these planets vary dramatically with each system having several tens of earth masses, and that the cores of the lower density planets have masses that differ by more than an order of magnitude from saturn s. for both systems the rv variations are likely caused by distortions in the spectral line profiles due to contamination from the nearby unresolved eclipsing binary. we correct for this contamination using the spectral cross - correlation function ( scf ), and find that it shows no significant variations. both stars show radial velocity variations that are consistent with the expected due to sky contamination. both planets orbit stars with super - solar metallicities, casting doubt on the correlation between planetary core mass and metallicity. we also present optical spectroscopy that yields radial velocities that are inconsistent with the predictions of the co - moving - edge model atmospheres of both planets. using the best - fit parameters of the padova et al. ( 2006 ) tep discovered by the galex satellite that was discovered five years earlier at the red giant, we find evidence that two of the three systems with orbital periods substantially exceed the period of the first - to last contact between the host star and the planetary companion. below this mass limit, only three of the seven known teps with masses similar to saturn have been discovered.
we present a group catalogue of 42 possible groups of galaxies that could have originated from the zcosmos - deep spectroscopic survey of galaxies. we have applied the group - finder algorithm to a sample of 3502 galaxies at @xmath0 drawn from the redshift survey by lilly et al., using mock galaxy catalogues that have been generated by kitzbichler & white, and then passed through the same ` ` group - finding '' algorithms used to calibrate and analyze our ` ` mock catalogues. '' we find a total of 42 such associations, with most of the galaxies belonging to what we would call ` ` spectroscopically - detected groups '', or ` ` candidate groups ''. though only a small fraction of these groups have been observed, they span a very wide range in redshift and can be identified as high - redshift ` ` ` progenitor galaxies ''. the mean overdensities of the candidate groups are 0.78arcsec@xmath1 and are comparable to the overdensity of galaxies in the general field at the same redshift. we do not find evidence of any colour differentiation of the galaxy population in and around these candidate groups relative to the field galaxies, though this should not be expected in the context of a monolithic, integrated dark matter halo analysis. at the position of the representative groups, we find up to a factor of 4 more massive galaxies than would be predicted by extrapolating the cosmic mean overdensity from the field, demonstrating that these massive galaxies are likely to be the progenitors of the most massive haloes in the universe today. we provide a detailed analysis of the properties of these galaxies and of the possible future evolution of these systems, including their merging histories, suggesting that these galaxies will likely assemble into a single extended halo. the z - deep galaxy sample itself is found to contain an excess of star - forming galaxies around the groups which can be accounted for by their high stellar mass and high x - ray luminosity. if the excess is primarily due to star - formation in the selected galaxies, and if the selection criteria for groups are similar to those applied to the cosmos, then the fraction of massive galaxies in these groups will increase over time, making these galaxy groups the dominant accelerating sources of the mass density of high redshift structures. methods : numerical - galaxies : clusters : general - cosmology : observations - dark matter - large - scale structure of universe
the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) is a project using 4 telescopes to search for kuiper belt trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) by the direct detection of their lightcurves using the video mode. the telescopes cover almost 6000 @xmath0 in a night and can scan the whole visible sky within a few hours. the detection process is powered by an efficient algorithm which takes advantage of all available camera time and allows for fast readout of the image motion across the field of view. this algorithm has been tested and confirmed to work well with the prototype telescope ( ps1 ), which was built and supported by the nasa grant gmn 2004 - 09 - 2 - 1. the ps1 telescope has a focal plane of 1.8 deg@xmath1 and is capable of detecting tnos as small as 0.02 mas in the northern hemisphere. it also has an innovative design of an orthogonal transfer charge coupled device ( otccd ) that allows on - chip charge shifting, which can compensate for the motion in the focal plane. by properly selecting the guide stars in the field, ps1 can efficiently search for tnos in real data. the optimal choice is based on the systematics of the stellar angular sizes and the maximum false positive rate that can be achieved with the current detection capabilities. in this paper we give an overview of the detection pipeline and present an estimation of the expected rate of events from the preliminary results of the survey. we also describe the most recent analysis of the lightcurve and show that the current systematics will be easily adapted to what is expected in the future. we conclude that the upcoming data will allow us to accurately determine the size distribution and hence the evolution of the tnos population. using the available engineering data and detection efficiency at 0.4 and 0.5 km, we were able to derive an effective solid angle for theotccds of 0.1 mas.
this paper is the second in a series in which we investigate the properties and the scaling relations of etgs as a function of the environment where they reside. we utilise a homogeneous dataset obtained from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey - large area survey ( ukidss ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). all galaxies have two estimates of the central velocity dispersion, one from sdss - dr6 and an alternative measurement from the sdss spectra with the software starlight. the main result of the present study is that the @xmath0 slope of the fundamental plane ( fp ) is an independent indicator of the stellar population age and metallicity, in agreement with previous results in the literature. in the first paper in the series, we show how the wavelength dependence of the fp can constrain the variation of stellar population parameters along the sequence of galaxy formation ( paper i ). here, we focus on analysing the effect of the selection bias, bias due to overlaps between fp and stellar population, and different sources of ir bias. we examine the kormendy and faber - jackson relations and demonstrate that, in general, massive etgs have coeval stellar populations, with slightly more metal rich galaxies being active galactic nuclei ( agn ) per decade in stellar mass. we also present the waveband variation of the edge- and face - on projections ofthe fp. we find that the observed scaling relations can be fitted well with a two - parameter model, one which has a high density core and another with a low density core, and a consistency between the two models. interestingly, the gaussian components of the model fit to the observations are required to match the main results of this paper.

the anderson model has become a paradigm for quantum information processing with linear or nonlinear time - varying degrees of disorder in recent years. this paradigm is expected to help in realizing quantum computers, in which continuous - variable quantum walks are implemented by unit cells embedded in semiconductor heterostructures. here, we demonstrate experimentally that a quantum walker supported by an array of reconfigurable beamsplitters can be localized in a 12-channel photodiode array and implemented using a continuous time - variable transistors. spatial localization results in a significant increase in the transport efficiency to the final sites of the walker, providing a route to quantum walkers with minimal on - chip transmission loss. quantum walks, the quantum analogues of classical random walks@xcite, are of interest for both fundamental and practical reasons. a key distinction between a random walk ( walker ) is its ability to maintain a close spatial contact with its origin site, in contrast to classical random walkers which are able to freely move across a region of space owing to their ability to dissipate energy locally. enaqt, in particular, has been proposed as an efficient platform for implementing and controlling random walks, and has been demonstrated for waveguide - assisted transport in both incoherent and chaotic systems@xmath0. this platform can be utilized to perform quantum computations, as well as for quantum walks with multiple input and output phases. however, it remains unclear whether disordered quantum walks ( qws ) will be able to perform deterministic quantum computation tasks as efficiently as those with discrete realizations. here we demonstrate that, through the interaction with a fluctuating environment, a qw s transport statistics can be greatly enhanced. in a regime where noise and anderson localization become coupled, leading to increased transport efficiency. in this regime, dt qws can be implemented without any unit cell and can be used as quantum information processors. we demonstrate this using a 240-channel, electronic biasing printed circuit board ( pcb ), which is capable of driving all channels from 0 to 12 volts with 183 @xmath1v discretization. out of the 240 pcb channels, we observed dynamic, ballistic, and static disorder, allowing us to implement qw realizations with a single unit cell. this experiment was enabled by a large number of unit - cell realizations of a disordered qw simulation process developed for cmos - compatible, low - dimensional quantum walks. we discuss the experimental realization of this qw realization and the implications for the
we examine time - dependent hydrodynamic models for winds from accretion disks in lyman - major planets, in particular lmxbs. x - ray heating of the gas in the disk can drive a hot, low density and fast wind. such a wind is expected to shield the disk against the strong ionization radiation from the central object. however, in the supersonic portion of the flow, above the disk, x - rays ionize the gas and decrease the wind terminal velocity. depending on the gas temperature and ionization state, the disk corona is not bound and static. a thermally - driven wind is likely to form a static corona or a plasma disk. we find that a disk wind from a geometrically - thin and optically - thick disk can not produce a robust wind. it can, however, produce a region of unusually high wind density where the thermal velocity exceeds the local escape velocity. thus the disk wind may overionize the corona and overproduce the uv lines. whether this is the case or not depends on the ratio of the total radiation force to the kinetic pressure at the disk surface and the wind mass loss rate. a pure uv - driven disk wind will produce uv emission lines but the line widths are typically small, typically @xmath0 cm, so that the effect of these lines on the dynamics of the disk is not significant. in contrast, a dense, warm and slow outflow from the disk nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium, close to the disk midplane, can produce a significant uv line. if so, the wind will be classified as a warm disk wind. we compare our results with observational constraints and show that either the mass accretion rate in high - state cvs is higher than presently thought by a factor of 2 - 3 or the broad absorption line quasars that show high mass loss rates are real objects. our calculations suggest that ultraviolet ( uv ) driven winds may be an important component of the outflows in agn. # 1#2#3#4#1@xmath1#2
we consider the problem of finding the shortest path joining two points is a straight line segment of a curve that encloses the largest possible area. this problem is a variation of the calculus of variations and an optimal economics control problem that does not fit into the classical class of variational problems. the problem arises when considering piecewise constant economics with control. the necessary conditions for this problem are derived from the natural boundary conditions of a classical variational problem and the corresponding optimal control problem. the results are then validated by symbolic algebra computations. the original idea of this paper was that of malinowska and torres back in 1882. the essential idea was that a firm with a downward sloping demand curve reacts to an increase in marginal cost by reducing output and increasing price. in this context, it is well understood that a requirement to pay a flat - rate royalty on sales has just this effect of increasing marginal cost and thereby decreasing output while simultaneously increasing price for a given firm. the effect of permitting the stationarity condition to be satisfied leads naturally to non - standard cov problems. we present a precise and very accurate solution to this problem using the shooting method and the highly accurate numerical recipes library routines. 40 time steps are needed to achieve a satisfactory solution. the newton shooting method is solved using two guessed values for the unknown final value @xmath0 and a nonlinear programming technique. we demonstrate that if the appropriate conditions ( nc ) are satisfied, then we should have the optimal solution. also we need to solve the necessary problem in the same time for both the shooting and optimal control problems and this is an extremising case of the two point boundary value problem. two approaches are used to solve for them. the first approach consists in finding the solution using a sequence of iterative solutions of the euler - lagrange equation. the second approach is to solve numerically the more difficult part of the problem taking full advantage of advanced numerical techniques. using the minos solver and the navarro - frenk - white ( nf ) algorithm, we show that for both cases we obtain a very accurate result. 40 # 1([eq:#1 ] ) # 1#1equation ( [ eq : cont_a^t f(t, y(t),u(t ) ) cont_int _ 0f_z^0_g(t,x)=0, t(x ) = 0, ( x ) l^2_i_w_i d_w _ w zb|
the bogoliubov theory of quasiaverages is applied to the physics of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron - hole system under the conditions of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) at one half filling factor for each layer and two half filling factors for both layers. the possibility to define the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the quantum hall excitons ( qhexs ) at @xmath0 as an estimate for the finite temperatures below the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition is suggested. a short review is given on the properties of the bec of the sodium atoms and on the implications for the energy spectrum of elementary excitations under these conditions. the breaking of the local gauge symmetry and the higgs phenomenon are discussed. the description of the optical dipole trap for the system of coplanar magnetoexcitons and the mechanisms responsible for their formation are proposed. the bogolov theorem is proposed to describe the plasmon - type particle under the condition of bec. in this case the green s function lineshape approach describes the radiation of the quasi - nambu - goldstone modes from the conduction band into the hole gas. their energy spectrum is determined and compared with that of the exciton - type branches. the role played by the quantum vortices in both cases is discussed. in the case of two layers a qhex is found to exist and it is shown that their energies as well as the density of condensed particles have a finite value at the critical point. the importance of the statistical gauge invariance, which is called gradient invariance or higher order symmetries, is demonstrated in this regime. pacs number(s ) : 74.25.dw, 05.45.+q, 75.10.-z, 85.10.+z 2 - dimensional electron gas, high magnetic field, fractional qu hall effect, quasmon resonance, exciton condensation in 2d systems + + _ institute of theoretical physics, chinese academy of sciences, + p.o.box 918(4 ), beijing 100049, people s republic of china + _ physics department, trinity college london, + london wc2a 2ls, united kingdom _
yso jets are a common feature of young stellar objects ( ysos ). one of the main characteristics of these jets is the presence of a narrow ( few km s@xmath0 ) and highly collimated ( @xmath1 ) jet beam. both the basic mechanisms for jet collimation and jet acceleration are known : radiative cooling and non - radiative sfic collimation. while both processes can be studied theoretically it is desirable to experimentally test the models. we have conducted a series of high resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of a periodically streaming central wind from a protostar wind interacting with an accreting toroidal density distribution. the model is based on the roe - solver and uses spherical coordinates. the initial conditions for the simulations are self - consistent models of the wind - driven bubble and its interaction with the accretion disk. the bubbles are initially too hot to be radiative and a ` jet - like'flow forms, although this process can also take place in more prolate geometries. the high resolution simulations show that the collimated flow is driven by a prolate shock shock and collision with the aspherical density distribution at the surface of the bubble. the speed of this shock - driven flow is comparable to that expected for gaseous jets. it is also found that the flow is collimated by gravity and by accretion ram pressure although with significantly smaller ` jet scale lengths than would be expected from purely hydrodynamic processes. the effects of cooling are also studied. we find that the introduction of cooling has a significant effect on the collimation processes. in particularly, the increase in outflow velocity in the simulations of reduced collimation is accompanied by an increase in the outflow collimation scale length. the results of our simulations are consistent with observations and suggest that strong collimation of supersonic jets can be achieved on time scales of a few days to a few gyr. # 1to 0pt#1 [ firstpage ] accretion, accretion disks protostellar matter stars : formation stars : pre - main sequence, stars : winds, outflows
observations of cai - like silicates in the diffuse interstellar medium show that the vast majority of silicates there are amorphous, with sub - micron grain sizes and a generally balanced mg - fe composition. these properties are consistent with a simple model for grain formation and evolution in protoplanetary disks. we use a 1d random - walk accretion - flow model to explore the processes that led to crystalline silicates from disks around low - mass stars. we consider the evolution of a disk s gas mass and dust properties, the effects of varying the size of the particles, the schmidt number, and the initial compactness of the disk, and we find that the relative diffusivity of disk - gas tracers allows particles as large as 2 @xmath0 m to reach the outer disk from small radii in a wide variety of models. for even larger particles, those of a few mm or larger, however, none of our disk models admits significant outward transport to the comet - forming region, regardless of the proposed source region. we demonstrate that a range of disk models are able to account for the presence of large - scale dust grains, including models in which the inner disk is initially quite compact and annealed. for these models, the outward mixing of grains can be strongly suppressed compared to the mean accretion flow rate, but turbulence can be strong enough to transport large grains out to large distances, even in the absence of annealing. this can happen if the disk was initially both compact and able to form comets, as suggested by some observational constraints. we also find that a high degree of general outward mixing can occur, at least as long as large grains are well coupled to the disk gas at the disk midplane. the magnitude of this amount of outward mixing depends upon the midplane spacing between the disk and the source region, and ranges from a few tens of au to several hundred au. our results suggest that a significant fraction of the primordial solar nebula s iron core is likely to have been formed at distances of at least 1 au from the sun in a disk that was massive enough to contain enough cold gas to freeze silicates out to 10 au and, possibly, to produce silicates that are now detectable in comets. in addition, comets are believed to have formed at disk centers that were at least an order of magnitude more dense than present - day disks. understanding the origin of these comets and the timescale for their formation is an important step toward
the european space agency ( _ esa _ ) is planning to place a gravitational wave ( gw ) detector in heliocentric orbit, to be launched in 2009. the mission is called lisa pathfinder ( lpf ). the instrument will consist of three modules : a _ data and diagnostics subsystem _ ( dds ), intended to monitor various factors of disturbance inside the mission vehicle, and a _ general system system _ ( gs ), responsible for all aspects of the mission investigation. the dds will provide full control over the total system noise, and will also provide redundancy redundancy in the data processing unit. the gs will provide gw induced phase shifts, which can be measured with the ` ` feedthrough '' instrument. the main component of the ltp is the _ lisa technolgy package _ ( ltp ), which includes the electronics, the magnetometers and the thermometers needed for lisa. this package has been thoroughly tested under different experimental conditions, and is proving to be satisfactory. it will provide diagnostics for the main instrument : temperature fluctuations. in order to provide reliable in - flight measurements of temperature fluctuations, perturbations between the masses of the test masses will be controlled, _ via _ the so called _ data management unit ( dmu ). this unit will autonomously monitor and respond to any changes in the system noise. therefore, a reliable ltp measurement will require a complete and unifying analysis of all the available data on the system. we discuss the motivation for this mission, and review the main technical aspects which are needed for its successful performance. we will review these characteristics in section [ lobo_-2.0 ], followed by a detailed discussion of the instrument concepts, processes and performance issues. section [ lisa_-3.1 ] addresses the different technical aspects of lisa, and the needed instrumentation and calibration for each of the modules. we describe the proposed ltp diagnostics, and show images of the detector detector working in action.
we report the detection of 1720 mhz emission from the source iras 18043@xmath42116. this is the first detection of emission from a post agb star that is known to show strong oh 1612mhz emission. the emission is seen as a single narrow peak at a slightly more blue - shifted velocity than the and main emission lines. the peak flux density is 1.22 jy at 69.4, with no linear polarization. the positional coincidence ( 0.3 ) of the emission in all three lines is consistent with a single point source. we also search for radio continuum emission at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz with no detection at the source position, resulting in an upper flux limit of 1.5 mjy ( five @xmath6 ). -6.5 true cm we consider the possibility that the is a maser, arising from one of the four ground - state transitions - ( 1612.231, 1665.402, 1667.359 and 1720.530 mhz ). the maser emission is strongest in the optically thick envelopes of oxygen - rich asymptotic giant arteries and possibly in the planetary nebulae. we hypothesize that the transition is collisionally excited in a region where shocks are present, at the interaction region between the remnant of the agb superwind phase and the hotter, secularly changing afterimage. the oh abundances are most likely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, with most of the molecules in the circumstellar envelope dissolved in the wake of the shock. subsequent dissociation of the water in the ambient radiation field sufficiently enhances the oh abundance to match that inferred from the emission. this picture is not in conflict with the observation that there is no known supernova remnant associated with to date. indeed, if the previously noted superwind is the progenitor of the, then the superwind could have occurred very recently, in the presence of a thick superwind. furthermore, it would be very difficult for any maser to remain undetected in such a region, in view of the wealth of other emission and morphological effects that may be present in, e.g., accretion, metallicity and dust inhomogeneities in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei.

we present results from follow - up x - ray and optical observations of a sample of 11 _ swift _ bat detections, including 7 active galactic nuclei and 5 extragalactic objects. in parallel with our ongoing program of optical classification of _ integral _ ibis sources, we also present detailed optical characterization of 8 sources. despite having already been classified in the literature, we find significant differences between the published results and our own analyses. in the case of swift j0918.5 + 1618, we confirm the presence of broad balmer, he i, he ii and fe i emissions and an iron line, not detected in the _ rxte _ slew survey, while the remaining 7 objects are classified as seyfert 1s. optical spectroscopy provides for the first time the classification of 8 objects and a distance estimate for 3 of them. in order to be consistent with the xrt data, we re - fitted the _ asca _ best - fit model for the whole sample and found that all objects are of type 2, in excess of the fraction of absorbed agns. particularly, we provide a detailed description of the narrow [ o iii ], [ o ii ] and [ ne iii ] emission lines and other weak features, detected on a flat spectral continuum. one object, identified on the basis of its h@xmath028/[o iii ] flux ratio, is classified as a type 1 agn ; in the most interesting case, we obtain a distance for this object of @xmath1 289.3 mpc. the diagnostic ratios, and also the iron line value, of this source are consistent with a classical type 2 agn and placing it in the compton thin regime. for the remaining objects, we determine different distances and different absorption column densities ; in particular, we exclude the possibility that the object considered a compton thick agn is in error. one of the most intriguing results of this work is a first classification of the galaxy j0927.1 + 2827 as type 1 according to its narrow emission lines, which supports the view that this galaxy is an intermediate polar ( magnetic ) cv.
we review some of the main results of high energy hadron interactions which are directly related to the elastic scattering amplitudes. the data are summarized as functions of the total energy and transferred momentum. the shape of the differential cross section is discussed and some of their general features are inferred from high energy data such as : the minimum of the blackness parameter at the isr energies, the diffraction cone, the damped diffraction, the shadowing contribution of the inelastic processes, the unitarity relation and the dispersion relation. the discussion of theoretical models is briefly focused on the latest experimental results obtained by the totem collaboration at the highest lhc energies 7 and 8 tev. the total and elastic cross sections at 7 tev are respectively estimated as 98.3 mb and 24.8 mb. the rough agreement between these data and the quasiclassical predictions is good. however, there are still some discrepancies in the total cross section and the slope at the intermediate angles. we briefly review the geometrical structure of the internal structure of colliding hadrons and the role of the different space regions in the scattering process. the impact parameter and the fourier - bessel transform are briefly discussed. * elastic scattering, diffraction cones and orear regions * + i.m. dremin@xmath0, m.v. pomeranchuk@xfig1 @xmath2_institut fr theoretische physik, universitt wrzburg, campus hubland nord, emil - fischer - str. 31 - 342, dresden, d-23807, switzerland _ _ + _ pacs number(s ) : 12.38.mv, 12.39.ba, 14.80.ly, 13.85.+p, 11.30.+q_issn, p.o. box 51, 44100, new york, ny 10027, usa _ 1.0 cm * contents * 1. introduction 1. general background 1. elastic scattering in proton - proton collisions 1. the basic phenomenological approach 1. experimental data on high energy interactions 1. hadron spectra and play theory 1. initial conditions for high energy elastic scattering 1. definition of the color center - of - mass and mass ratio for each hadron 1. angular distribution of the initial energy and the mass of the colliding particles 1. basic parameters of color centers 2. color centers for diffraction 3
we present the discovery and subsequent analysis of tyc-3010 - 1494 - 1, a stellar binary that initially appeared as a single star with a substellar companion. as part of the marvels project to search for brown dwarf ( bd ) companions to solar - type stars, we obtained observations of the system using the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ), the sloan 2.5 m telescope ( sloan digital sky survey ; sdss - iii ), and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) 9.2 m telescope. our discovery data indicated that the system is a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) with an eccentric period of @xmath0 days and a mass ratio of 2.2@xmath1. by the time we began to analyze the data near periastron, however, tyc 3010 had extended its orbit significantly beyond that of the primary star, which suggested that the secondary was most likely a non - bd companion. in this paper, we monitor the system as a function of its orbital eccentricity and ( radial velocity ) inclination, as well as its photometric properties. we confirm that the high eccentricity, high inclination secondary, and high velocity ( rv ) signal are consistent with the bd scenario, but we find that the data initially suggested a _ false positive _ for the secondary. we discuss the circumstances that led to such a false positive, and we describe methods that are currently being used to recognize this kind of astrophysical false positive in the future. we also present the physical properties of the systems that comprise the make up of marvels stars, including ( 1 ) the flux - weighted mean of two sets of stellar spectral lines, ( 2 ) the width and/or opening of the cross - correlation function, ( 3 ) the rv statistics for the system, and ( 4 ) an accurate determination of the atmospheric parameters for the primary and for both stars. an analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using the ` ` iac '' method extracted stellar parameters from the two - component fit to the sed, yielding a set of values for the stellar parameters of the secondary ( mass, radius, and mass ratio ).
we report the results of a two - pronged approach to the measurement of stellar population properties at large galactocentric radii for a sample of 37 low - mass early - type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters. we study the spatial distribution of luminosity@xmath0,weighted age, total metallicity [ z / h ], and [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratio out to one effective radius, by using nearly all the lick / ids indices. the comparison of these line - strength indices with single stellar population models ( ssps ) is found to be successful. we observe statistically significant differences in the distributions of these parameters for galaxies of different masses. the bulk of the galaxies in our sample are found to follow well - defined kinematic and photometric profiles, in good agreement with the predictions of the competing scenarios for disk galaxies and bulges in the local universe. we find weak correlation between the mass and the velocity dispersion at small radii, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more likely to have larger stellar radii. in the context of the hierarchical merging scenario, we discuss the implications of our results for the galaxy formation process and for the scaling of star formation rates with galaxy mass. our results are most sensitive to the parameterization of the star formation rate and the time delay between star formation peaks. we are able to constrain the parameters of competing scenarios, and their implications for the global evolution of the stellar populations have started to become apparent only over the past few gyr. the main uncertainties in our predictions are related to the slope of the density distribution, the amount of gas cooling and to the geometry of merger remnants.

we investigateabs mediated electron transport in three - terminal quantum dot devices fabricated on carbon nanotubes with one central superconducting contact. we find that the ground state of the quantum dot ( qd ) can be interpreted as a superposition of the even and doubly occupied charge states of the single qd, and that abs can be excited by single electron tunneling events whose characteristic frequency is determined by the coupling strength to the normal metal contacts ( n ), @xmath0. we show that for weak n - n coupling the abs resonances can be resolved by andreev resonances ( ars ) in the third terminal. from the measurement results we conclude that the broad absorption features we observe in some devices are caused by abs mediated transport from n to s. finally, we demonstrate that a finite coupling to s allows the exchange of even charge states, which is necessary for the hybridization of the qd with s. our results suggest that in some parameter regime both sets of states are available for different transport processes. * introduction * strong coupling to superconductors is a prerequisite for the development of new physics beyond the standard model of superconductivity.@xcite this is due to the fact that weak coupling to a superconductor results in a large gap in the electronic band structure of the system, which can be used to introduce a new ` ` anomalous '' states into the system. one of the most promising candidates for this mechanism is the long - range coupling to electronic systems, which offers the possibility to bypass the problem of the pairing phase transition and give access to the electronic phase transition at large separations and high electron densities. @xcite however, the origin of these anomalous states remains unclear. some theoretical predictions might be related to the formation of new phases or topological excitations. transport spectroscopy, however, has not been able to probe the detailed dynamics of electrons in two - terminal devices. to address this issue, here we discuss three different approaches that have been used to investigate absorption of electrons by electrons confined in two-terminal quantum dots ( qds ). the first approach is to use a weakly coupled qd to an n - qd system in which the interactions are strongly coupled to an external normal metal ( s ) point such that the two qds can be separated in energy by a short normal metal tunneling event. in this approach it is possible to gain insight into the electronic dynamics of the ultrafast ( lt ), which gives rise to characteristic peaks in
we develop a unified framework for describing the four hallmarks of oee, including those associated with real, finite dynamical systems, in terms of formal definitions that are applicable to any dynamical system that can be decomposed into two interacting subsystems : the _ organism _ ( or ` ` cell automata '' ) and the _ environment '' ( or rule space ). we identify new cellular automata ( ca ) variants that implement time - dependent rules and varying degrees of openness to an environment, where the time dependence takes on different functional forms for each. to demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed definitions, we first introduce a rigorous definition for oee that relies on formalized versions of unbounded evolution and innovation, both of which rely on direct comparison to counterfactual histories. we then introduce two new variants of the eca rule that fully utilize these two definitions, and we explore mechanisms for generating oee in systems of _ finite size _, depending on the degree to which they are open to an environmental change. specifically, we implement laws that relax some of the constraints of both definitions and that allow a system of _ fixed _ state - dependent dynamics to exhibit oee. in both cases, the resulting rules are tested against detailed numerical simulations. finally, we identify a scalable mechanism that produces a set of self - consistent, open - ended rules that includes the capacity for on - going production of complexity by coupling to larger environments. our results show that such a mechanism is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than the one suggested by earlier work, and may be applicable to a wide range of complex systems. the framework thus offers a simple and general framework that unifies our understanding of mechanisms that may be driving the rich dynamical behavior of biological and technological systems. it also offers a way to probe broader mechanisms that might be operating in diverse domains of research in diverse fields, ranging from biological evolution to artificial intelligence. the new results are found to be consistent with trends that have been identified in other branches of science and technology.
a finite abstract simplicial complex @xmath0 is a finite set of non - empty sets, called simplices, so that the search for combinatorial invariants can be abandoned unless it can be performed in a discrete hadwiger space which is then the main focus of that class of objects. we insist that any notion of homotopy group which honors the topology of the graph should respect the concept of dimension. we claim that the only homotopical invariant which is well established in the discrete is that of wu characteristic which is a subbase of the euler characteristic spectrum. we impose a condition that all such invariants must be homotopic to the graph and that a dimension condition is satisfied for intersections. we want any reasonable notion of cohomology to honor this condition and insist that abstract finite simplicial complexes which are not turing machines can not be used to build a turing machine which can distinguish any pair of abstract finite simple and complete silica complexes. in this paper we describe the strategy which allows us to stay in the realm of much the more accessible graph category, on which the complex of finitely many finite simplices is barycentric refined. the strategy is well motivated by the quest to find a complete finite set, or even a complete collection, of invariants which allow the distinguishability of an arbitrary pair of simplices not only to be established but also to have a complete structure on the set. a complete, foundational understanding of the geometry on a graph is not only possible but often sufficient to obtain a tractable theory can also be achieved. + from the algorithmic point of view it is clear that every finite set or a partial ordered set of finite simple graphs is an order complex. hence, in order complexes, like the whitney clique complex or the matroids, it is more accessible to study and often more interesting than the simplices. + examples of what is to be done in the domain of algebraic geometry on finite sets have been given by jonsson @xcite and even richer geometry on non - finite sets has been realized in hyperbolic manifolds and manifolds. the attempts to construct such a manifold in a systematic way in the context of graph theory have been made by many authors and the list goes on. however, in the end we would like to end the quest for exact results by pointing out that an important improvement over the previous methods which are sure to be useful in future theoretical developments is certainly achievable. we discuss some open
we present high resolution, near - infrared images of the central regions of 24 luminous infrared galaxies obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nicmos camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on board the hst. the morphologies of the galaxies in this sample have revealed diverse features, probably reflecting their varying stages of merging and nuclear interactions. eleven of the 24 systems exhibit point - like nuclear sources with projected separations 0.4 - 0.5 kpc, including seven of the most luminous systems in the sample ( 10@xmath114 total flux at 2.2 @xmath12 m ). the nuclear sources in 7 of the systems with significant point - source contributions are classified as warm in terms of their mid - infrared colors, while all the other galaxies, warm or cold, are observed to have cold nuclei. 8 of the 9 warm galaxies appear to have hii - like optical emission line profiles, while only one is warm. the observed trends in the nuclear contribution as a function of luminosity, merger stage and nuclear characteristics suggest that a significant fraction of the total bolometric luminosity ( and hence mass ) in these galaxies is contained in the extended nuclear regions at wavelengths where the effects of dust extinction are diminished. regardless of whether this extended light is due to stars produced as a result of the merger or by other mechanisms, recent 825 images of two galaxies provide strong evidence that only the high surface brightness nuclear features are contributing significantly to the overall bolometric light of these galaxies. the degree of central compactness and the total amount of unresolved nuclei in the infrared luminous galaxies ( which accounts for 0.10.2 resolution and presumably extends over a scale over 500 pc ) are investigated, along with the nature of the nuclear features and their radial profile fits to the images. for some galaxies, the observed nuclear features look similar to the nuclear disks seen in the ultraluminous, warm galaxies. others have nucleus - to - nucleus separations comparable to the sizes of their central disks ( which probably are undergoing their major merging events ). further analysis of the dust extinction curves indicates that these curves are correct for reflection effects but are not unique in the detail of the extended features. using the extinction curves and the observed surface brightness distribution of the nuclei, we estimate bolometric masses of the resolved nuclei and starbursts in our sample.
we study the sampling aspect of reconstructing a stochastic source @xmath0 from a limited set of measurements, and also distinguish the two cases that are of interest for the study. we show that the reconstruction error is bounded by the mean squared error of the original signal, and that the optimal error matrix for the recovery is a linear combination of the error measures of both the original and corrupted signals. the quality of the reconstructions is characterized by the minimization of the sampling noise. this quality is the same for samples corrected by overlaps, so long as the noise is not added to the reconstructed signals. for many applications, it is critical to have good sampling rates both in the frequency domain and in the source coding domain. there has been much study in the literature on how to improve the sampling rates of noisy sources. some of the results are expected to be universal to various source coding domains @xcite, and others may have specific applications. in this paper, we determine the optimal sampling rate for reconstructions of arbitrary source types, and show that it is possible to achieve a significant gain in the sampling error when one improves the receiver error rate. the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ], we recall the construction of the circuit for superconducting devices, and demonstrate the use of superconductors in some signal processing problems ( see the paper by chuang, dai, hoang, and kee ) in the other aspects of information processing ( e.g., computing error models for higher dimensional networks ; fast quantum computing for low dimensional systems ; etc. ), the construction works according to the rules of quantum information processing, with the exception of some special cases such as for noisy source coding and least squares error theorem ( lemma ), which have additional consequences in the signal processing and signal estimation aspects. in sections [ sec2 ], 3, 4, and 5 ( respectively ), we derive the lemma and demonstrate its effectiveness for a wide class of problems, and give some examples.
in this paper we investigate cauchy perturbative matching in spherical symmetry, and describe techniques for implementing it in spherically symmetric spacetime. we use einstein s field equations, the high - order difference operators satisfying summation - by - parts ( sbp ) relations, and a recently - constructed finite differencing and dissipation method, which we describe below. we also consider the evolution of a schwarzschild black hole in painlev - gullstrand coordinates, coupled to a klein - gordon field. for this purpose, we use a continuum model and an isolated, killing - field adapted discrete model, and ancillary parameters, such as the mass and energy estimates of the black hole, the spacetime curvature and expansion rate, and the propagation constants of the einstein christoffel form of the field equations. the evolutions are transient in the sense that a black hole is observed to change its mass by accreting a wave packet with a constraint - preserving boundary condition and settling back to equilibrium after a finite amount of time. we find that the resulting system is stable against random perturbations in the scalar field. the absence of any mode growing with increasing resolution shows that the system is dynamically stable even against strong random noise injected into the system. these features and the results of the stability analysis are promising for efforts to do three - dimensional matching between different domains using well - posedness of the governing equations as a resource. cern - ph - th/2005 - 241 + tum - hep-610/05 + mpp-2005 - 156 + hep - ph/0512032 + july 2005 + + 0.5 cm * effects of covariance in two - dimensional spatial structure : * + a review * + p. coullet, l. gilmozzi, and p. d. lettini + _ theory division, department of physics and astronomy, university of california, berkeley, usa _ + _ email : p.coulton@cpc.cs.u.edu + _ address for correspondence : _ cern, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland + _ phone : _ + 49-(0)251 - 83 - 21096 + e - mail : c.puc@cern.ch, g.m.pettre@ucl.ac.uk + _ licensing provisions _ + none
we set up a hierarchy of coarse - grained models ( cgms ) to study the phase diagram of linear polymers in a good - solvent as well as in a dilute bad - solvent regime. the main idea is to use the domb - joyce model as the reference system, in the range where the two - body and three - body interactions are vanishingly small and of the same order of magnitude. in this regime, the effective interactions between the cg atoms are independent of the number of blobs, as long as all lengths are expressed in terms of the blob radius of gyration. we implement the transferability approximation to model the interaction hamiltonian and, using this strategy, we are able to reproduce quite accurately the crossover functions observed both in the dilute and in the semidilute regimes for various values of the effective interaction potential @xmath0. we perform extensive simulations of the model for various densities and temperatures, and find that the extension of the cgm to finite density allows one to ` see'large - scale behaviors, which are absent in the full cgm. moreover, the proposed transferability approach shows that within a finite temperature interval, ( i.e., at sufficiently low polymer concentration ), the good - solvents regime is reached at all temperatures and for all densities, cgm reproduces the polymer phase diagram very reasonably. finally, we discuss how the universal, scaling limit can be used to define a new chain - lifter model, which has the same properties of the tetramer model for finite density, but is different in some respects. this model will be of interest for synthetic studies of linear polymer chains. = 1
bell - chsh - inequality violation is a well - known consequence of the fact that an entangled state of two quantum systems can not be produced by unitary transformations of a single nonlinear resource. local realistic theories starting from a localistically motivated vacuum state consistently predict the violation of this inequality under certain sets of local operations. here, we study the effect of imperfections in homodyne detectors, which can be thought of as a manifestation of effective rotations applied to nonlinear measurements. in particular, we consider the case where a mixed resource, such as an initial single - mode squeezed state, is used to generate an entangled two - mode state. we find that as the squeezing parameter of the initial state increases, the degree of violation of bell s inequality is largely controlled by the properties of the resource under consideration. we also find that the same resource can be used to introduce additional squeezing in the subsequent evolution of the entangled state. the study of bell inequalities is a very important area of physics where a variety of powerful tools are routinely used by scientists to obtain information on a nonlinear variety of physical phenomena. with these tools, ranging from cosmology to condensed matter physics, a rich body of results has been obtained in this area @xcite. some of these results so far had been obtained with methods very different from those used in classical physics. for instance, the bell inequality test based on the classical theory of superpositions of two states, as implemented by landau - ginzburg - wilson - hohenberg in the early seventies, can be regarded as a violation of local realistic theory in its original form ( see, for a review ). to make matters worse, by using more and more inefficient methods of quantum theory, such nonlinearities have to be avoided in order to obtain a better measurement of quantum correlations. unfortunately, the problem of finding a physically effective set of ground - state rotations has become an increasingly important problem when it comes to low temperature quantum states. in fact, as low - temperature spacetimes are inherently correlated, any attempt to use them for the purpose of quantum information processing has to be based on a loss of quantum coherence and hence quantum entanglement. a possible way to overcome this difficulty is to use less inefficient detectors. an example of such an inefficient detector is a beam splitter, which is used in quantum information storage and processing as a resource. in such a device, quantum correlations are tunable and its efficiency can be systematically improved by reducing the number of collisions between its
autonomous, adaptive individuals within a biological network are known to track and investigate the spatial structure of spatiotemporally evolving environments. recent experiments have shown that groups of schooling fish are able to track schools of fish based on adaptation to their environment by performing a collective search in a two - dimensional advected chemical signal. in this paper we show that similar collective behavior can be developed in bacterial chemotaxis groups. by modifying their behaviour based on local conditions autonomous individuals can track a chemical signal and locate their source. our model illustrates how simple adaptive social interactions can lead to cooperative behavior that in this case produces an emergent group level search. furthermore the model is applicable to a wide range of different group sizes and has potential applications for distributed, autonomous systems. the ability of ecosystems to adapt and adjust their behavior to complex spatio - temporal environmental conditions is a fundamental strength of biological systems @xcite. examples of adaptation to new environmental conditions include pathogens ( e.g. hiv, rab rab rabies ), viral mrna or dna ( eukaryotic cells ), locusts ( eg hysteretic cells ) and fish schools ( eichelkraichia coli, nematodes and flocks of seahill and cichlid ). many of these systems adapt to a noisy and often variable environment and their response to changing environments by altering their spatial behavior. for example allowing groups of individuals to track a nutrient source or a potential mate has been shown to be adaptive to morphological changes in a range of complex networks @xmath0. to guide individuals in a group towards a source we often refer to networks of interacting individuals as _ adaptive social networks_. such networks often rely on repeated sampling of the same environment to detect and investigate spatial regions. while many networks of such networks have been built up in ecosystems to support cooperative behavior, only a few of them have been able to achieve this level of adaptability and this can be explained by the fluctuating environment both in terms of the types of social interactions between the individuals and the morphological organization of the network. in particular local networks were shown to adapt to and rely on the presence of low local concentration environments resulting in patchy and as a result were able to maintain a regular distribution of food and water. this results in the network of sensors able to quickly detect and locate nearby regions of improved spatial and temporal properties of the environment ( for example the edges of a filament ). to date, however, most theoretical studies on this
we present keck spectroscopy and imaging for a sample of 17 dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies in the virgo cluster that span a wide range in rotational support. we find that des with or without significant rotation velocities can not be distinguished based on their internal kinematics ( either position in the fundamental plane or line - strength index ). we present evidence for underlying disks and/or substructure in both rotating and non - rotating des, but observe no evidence for such structure in a third rotating de. we investigate whether and not de properties such as morphology, stellar population, and local environment are correlated with the degree of internal rotation, as defined from either observed rotation velocity or velocity dispersion. rotating des span a broad range in rotation velocity ( @xmath0 0.5 - 2.0 times the de vaucouleurs velocity ), but do not appear to be well correlated with other internal properties or the local environment within the galaxy cluster. no correlation is found between rotation velocity and either the luminosity - weighted age of the stellar population or the metallicity of the de galaxy, suggesting that rotating des may not have been fully transformed from their progenitors. we measure h@xmath1 index values using absorption line - strengths in the de images of a representative sample of eleven rotating des and compare them to the single - burst stellar population models of @xcite. our results are consistent with solar abundance ratios for mass - to - light ratios, and suggest that rotation - flattened des are more common in massive galaxies than classical ellipticals. we conclude that there is no strong correlation between de rotation and either morphology or local environment for the rotating des in our sample. we show that our sample and other de samples with similar kinematic types show a similar level of rotation support, but span a much wider range in degree of rotational flattening than do the less rotating de samples found in local group environments. we argue that for cluster des rotating with significant rotation support ( i.e., having significant rotation, but without evident substructure ), this may indicate that the root - mean - square velocity of the observed rotation support is not a good indicator of the dynamics.
we show that, for systems of massive clumps and a smooth background, the time for the system to sink into the centre is significantly longer than the dynamical friction time. as a consequence, the total phase space mass density distribution of the system is invariant, and the cluster mass function is also nearly invariant. this implies that clump - clump interactions can lead to irreversible evolution, but, when such are included, the invariant distribution is practically preserved. this is demonstrated using a numerical simulation of cosmological haloes, coupled with a polar particle mesh code. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) desy 09 - 050 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * persistence of invariant profiles in cosmology * + + n. gisin, g. ribordy, w. tittel and h. zbinden + _ max planck institut fr physik _, + heisenbergstrae 1, 85748 garching, germany _ + e. knill, r. laflamme and g. j. milburn + _ mathematical physics department, university of hertfordshire, + college lane, hatfield, herts, al10 9ab, uk _ + + e - mail : knill@maths.ac.uk + _ accepted for publication in phys. rev. d _ * # 1 * + 28 may 2009 + + http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0370157314003871 + + b. n. christodoulides, m. dniti, and t. pitt, ` ` frozen in phase space, '' science * 306 *, 726729 ( 2000 ). + c. costa, e. diakonos, and c. lazzeroni ( _ cosmology _, new york, 1998 ) + _ _ presented at the ieee 2006 nuclear science symposium, berkeley, usa, 2006 _ + ( to be published ) +
we use data from the 3d - hst legacy program to map the spatial distribution of emission ( a tracer of star formation ) and stellar continuum emission ( rest - frame 7000 ) for a sample of 2676 galaxies at 0.7<z<1.5 ) at @xmath0. the spectral energy distribution of the emission line falls into two mass bins spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass and encompassing the star forming ` ` main sequence '' ( ms ). we present the profiles of as a function of and stellar surface density. these are the first spatially resolved emission line maps of galaxies at all times during the history of the universe. the radial surface brightness of rises monotonically toward small radii and saturates near the centers of galaxies well above the main sequence, indicating that star formation is increasing the size of galaxies. this study complements large mosdef and kmos@xmath10 spectroscopic surveys by providing higher spatial resolution emission line measurements. we identify galaxies that are likely to host active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as sources of and continuum emission. stacking thousands of hst orbits provides deep long - slit stacks of galaxies that allow us to trace the distribution of and emission down to a surface brightness limit of ( a proxy for the stellar mass ) of 0.13 ". we find that the is brightest in the central region of these galaxies ( i.e., within a projected distance of 1 - 2kpc ) is well represented by this feature. most of the galaxies that we see are star forming systems, with a median star formation rate ( sfr ) of approximately @xcite consistent with the idea that the emission originates in disks. however, we see clear evidence for outside - the - main - sequence galaxy disks. the disk scale length is larger for the more massive galaxies and smaller disk scale lengths are found in galaxies on the rise. in low mass galaxies, while the is as luminosity - weighted mean pixel in the x- and y - directions is similar to that of the continuum emission, the flattening of the spectrum is clearly evident from the average surface brightness profile shape. this suggests that the star formation activity is not solely due to gas accretion, but is instead due to an evolution of the galaxy size from the lowest to the highest mass bins. our observations provide a direct measure of inside - out growth which appears to be a crucial feature of galaxy assembly history.
anomalous couplings in the standard model generally give rise to trilinear @xmath0 and quartic interactions between the gauge bosons. in the electroweak sector, however, the quartic couplings can be considered as a more direct window on electroweak symmetry breaking, in particular for the scalar sector. in this context, an anomalous quartic coupling may provide the first evidence of new physics ( new physics which couples to electroweak bosons ). we study the impact of these couplings on various cross sections, and quantify their sensitivity to the anomalous feynman diagrams and the matrix element. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * * * thomas r. hemmert@xmath1 * + * z. l. wang@xsam.ac.cn + _ physik - department, university of wuppertal, germany _ + _ e. mail : w.r.l.wang@wustl.edu.au + _ the production of heavy particles, and in particular photons, is one of the key processes in heavy ion physics, and is crucial for a complete understanding of the non - abelian structure of the universe @xcite. this process is particularly important at high - energy colliders, where electrons and positrons are produced in the bulk, and heavy particles are generated in the tail of the distribution of virtual particles such as supersymmetric particles or technipions. + from a theoretical point of view, the main phenomenological aspects of this process areipationless and purely dependent on the mass and energy of the two colliders involved, in combination with the available photon energy. the two processes are however intimately related to the physics of the physical processes they probe, since about a third of the contributing diagrams are removed when the beam polarisation is negative. furthermore, the processes do not suffer from the residual effects of photon polarisation, so the inclusion of the transverse polarisation effects in our analysis is not an urgent necessity. + as an example, at a future linear collider ( lc ) it will be possible to distinguish between two processes where the two types of couplings are genuine relative to each other, and three processes where one type of coupling is stronger than the other. this will allow a precise assessment of the relative merits of the above - mentioned processes, and will
we present _ galex _ ultraviolet ( fuv ) and nuv imaging, obtained as part of an ongoing uv imaging survey of the sauron sample of @xmath0 early - type galaxies and the guest investigator programme ( ngs ; e / s0 ). we obtained fuv ( 16.4@xmath1 - 21.0 ), nuv ( 14.5@xft ) and optical imaging from the mdm observatory ( f555w ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ), as well as ground - based optical imaging. we find that nearly half of the galaxies in our sample exhibit strong or substantial residual star formation, with a range of large - scale ages and/or metallicity gradients in their outermost regions. around @xcite, we previously highlighted the importance of the central stellar discs and kinematically - decoupled cores in the presence of hot stars, and here we present evidence that the same stellar populations were responsible for the majority of these objects. in the present study, we present spatial - resolved uv and optical images, the first phase of the uv colour - magnitude relations, and present evidence for the first two - dimensional fundamental planes in the three - dimensional manifold of their mass distribution. the fundamental planes have a tilt indicating the tilt of the fundamental plane ( fp ) towards the virial theorem, and we identify at least five galaxies that are likely to be classified as rsf early - types. our new uv data provide valuable information on the stellar populations of these galaxies, allowing us to estimate the total dynamical mass - to - light ratio and the velocity dispersion of their stellar populations. using the integrated uv colours of classic uv - upturn galaxies from the sdss, we find some galaxies exhibit evidence for both a central star formation and an age / metallity gradient, enabling us to identify them as being the galaxies with the highest levels of recent star formation or the most energetic star formation in the local universe. a quantitative prediction of the fp tilt and scatter can now be explained largely by the fact that the scale and scale - invariance of the intrinsic uv fundamental planes are largely determined by the population of young star - forming galaxies in this sample. we discuss the implications of these results for the scaling relations and make an attempt to interpret their detailed properties. in particular, the bluer - than - ism fundamental planes appear to be more wide - spread, both in the central and outer
the strong equivalence principle is a physical principle which limits the choice of observational evidence that is immeasurably better now than it was in 1917. i argue that the equivalent principle in cosmology is more restrictive in its application to averages of matter density than it is in newtonian gravity. as a consequence, determinations of the physical properties of macroscopic objects, such as clocks and the relative deceleration of the background, are made more difficult by the presence of a non - static background. i propose an alternate route to the physical interpretation of cosmological general relativity, wherein reference to the average dynamics of spacetime is replaced by the concept of _ local _ causal processes within the past light cone. this permits a better understanding of how to ` ` recalibrate '' clocks and decelerate rods, and consequently of the relative recalibration of clocks between different spacetime regions. a first principle treatment of this problem is to assume that the fluctuations of energy and momentum generated by slowly moving point particles in a static minkowski frame are averaged over times as large as a hubble time, and to treat the gravitational interaction as a purely local dynamical phenomenon. i outline the methodological problems that must be faced to account for the large scale of realisations of dynamical clocks, rods and clocks, when the background is not static. as an example, i consider the geodesic flow of a congruence of particles ` ` at rest '' in a dynamically expanding universe, whose average volume expansion is governed by an average over all masses and motions of the particles, and the equivalent volume expanding motion of a localaneously moving observer. at each epoch the volume average of pressureless dust can be ` ` renormalised away '' on sufficiently small scales, but in a way which may lead to a ` ` reinterference '' of the scale of particles between frames, and ultimately to the divergence of the standard calibration of clocks. the result of this exercise is a highly reduced version of mach s principle, given that the observable universe was in a global state very close to a friedmann lematre robertson walker ( flrw ) geometry with negative weyl curvature at last scattering, i.e., for all observable spatially flat universes there is a very small spatial scale on which the sep can be applied. i conclude that the sep provides a more general physical theory of local causal processes in astrophysics than has been achieved hitherto, and offers a more controlled way of applying it to cosmology.
we discuss the effects of bars and bulges on the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies. we use stellar - dynamic simulations to construct four different galaxy models and ` ` observe '' these galaxies using the same observational techniques and algorithms that we apply to real data. we first demonstrate that the dark matter density and rotation curve rotation curves are often distorted by projection effects. for instance, when the rotation curve is defined as the intensity weighted mean of position - velocity diagrams, the rotation velocity is systematically underestimated for most of the view angles. in turn, this leads to an overestimation of the true mass by up to 15 % at low ( @xmath0 ) surface brightness. we also demonstrate that gas in the central 1 - 2 kpc region has a different energy spectrum than stars and that this difference can not be simply explained by the shortcomings of the cdm model. we then present results of our observations of rotation of gas and stars. our simulations show that bulges significantly affect the observed rotation curves. when the galaxy is seen edge - on, the gas rotates at a faster speed than the stars. in the center of the region where the gas is more transparent, stars and gas do not rotate at the same speed and the gas component is typically twice larger than the vertical velocity. large non - circular velocities result in asymmetric drift of the stellar rotation curve. we show that these effects are far from negligible. after correcting these effects, we find that the mass density distribution derived from rotation curves is nearly independent of the galaxy orientation. the magnitude of the differences between observed and simulated rotation curves may be relevant to the determination of the hubble constant. our results may also apply to the analysis of bulges in other galaxies. for example, it is found that the velocity dispersion of a cold neutral gas as well as of an ionized component is significantly lager than naively expected if the distribution is clumpy or filamentary. these results challenge the common expectation that the gas in spiral galaxies is a cold medium with low velocity dispersions.
the laser interferometer for gravitational - wave astronomy ( ligo ) is a combination of a continuous - wave laser system for low - frequency detection, a solid - state diode - pumped nd : yag system for high frequency calibration, and a geohf detector, which is sensitive to low - energy astrophysical sources such as low - mass x - ray binaries and neutron stars. ligo was originally designed to make ligo, a one - dimensional ( radius 4 km ), sensitive detector of about 15@xmath0mpc sensitivity. it has since been extended in various ways, including a change of its arm structure that increases the sensitivity below 200hz to roughly 200hz. one of the most promising extensions is the advanced ligo instrument, proposed in 2007 @xcite, that will increase the sensitivity of the detectors by an order of magnitude to @xmath1mpc. initial ligo will consist of three interferometers with 4 km arms that are enclosed in a high vacuum system. the length of the arms is monitored using radio - frequency ( rf ) wavefront sensing and optical levers. the design and construction of the enhanced ligo subsystems, which will be completed in 2011, will allow for routine calibration and performance measurements of several subsystems throughout the next three years. initial high - sensitivity measurements will be provided by ligo with a sensitivity of roughly 200mpc and one or two high - precision measurements of gravitational waves, such as a sinusoidal wave signature near the center of strong constraints on the mass for binary systems. the first data collections will be taken in mid-2009, and the most sensitive observation will be done in 2011 of a roughly 10-mhz band with a resolution camera, so that the combination of the large aperture and wide field camera ( wfc ) can be processed quickly. in addition, the data collection will be supplemented with data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ), obtained during the s5 data collection run. improved ligo sensitivity is planned for the s6 data run in 2009, including an initial sensitivity measurement of about 800kw and a coverage of nearly all of the phase of the parameter space, including noise, resulting in a maximum sensitivity of about 50kw ( compared to initially ligo of about 10kw ). the data collected will be used to calibrate and characterize the subsystems that will be key to the successful application of advanced virgo, the virtual observatory for high - frequency astronomy, during s5. advanced l
the main result of this paper is that the canonical free lie algebra of ( associative, cocommutative ) coassociative bialgebras, where @xmath0 is the hochschild cohomology complex, is ( isomorphic ) canonical. the previous result of @xcite, of a similar nature, follows from the classical work of loday ( *??? * ). the new result is relevant to the study of natural operations on the chevalley - eilenberg complex of a lie algebra, an area in which our interest was at that time. some of the other results in this paper are of interest as well. the paper is intended to be accessible as far as possible to a general audience, in particular we have confined the more technical material to a special room at the university of mulhouse. in the first part of the paper we present our main result, namely the existence of a canonical, free and canonical die algebra, called the _ canonical lie algebra _, in the presence of a ( very ) high - dimensional field field of characteristic zero. the novel result is that this theory does not apply in the asymptotic case, where the field is much more complex. we also show that the classical notion of a _ triplette _, developed by loday in the 1970s, has no application in the context of our main theorem. address = department of mathematics, university of florida, gainesville, fl 32611 usa ; m. goze and e. remm, _ lie admissible algebraic structure _ ( _ algol _ ), shallower book, _ # 1 _ ( # 2 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 _ int. j. mod. phys. _ * a#1 *, # 2 ( 19#3 ) the pre - lie algebra constructed by m. livernet and j. stasheff from the simplicial hamiltonian of the coassociation coalgebra has explicit topological properties which are not captured by the associated lie algebra. a. shahzaman, m. khaykovich, and s. v. kharkevich, _ the structure of the subalgebra of free and fixed bialgebra in terms of hopf invariants _, phys. rev. lett. * 90 *, 077405 ( 2007 ). m. hirsch, a. yariv, and d. zajacek, ` ` symplectic fibres of the
we propose a two - dimensional axisymmetric model for the computation of average stresses in granular materials consisting of convex grains. the model, the @xmath0-model, is based on the geometric randomness of the presence of tangential and tangential forces in the solution space of the force and torque balance equations. in the limit of all possible solutions of the equations with uniform probability, the space of possible solutions can be parameterized by three real numbers denoting the fraction of the vertical component of force that is transmitted to one of the cells in the next layer below. weights can be represented by a network of arches with thickness on the order of the grain size and a single layer could be used to represent the stress field in the bulk of the material. in contrast to the mohr - coulomb constitutive relations that are widely used in the description of shear stress in cohesive materials, the real space distribution of the stress amplitudes obtained in this model is not shown to be consistent with any single value for the average stress field, but it is studied in detail. the stress fluctuations at the microscopic and macroscopic levels can be modeled as a hyperbolic isotropic distribution, with the characteristic depth of the approach diverging as a function of the layer thickness. an analysis of the maximum stress diverges suggests that the transition from a differential to a continuous stress can be regarded as a discontinuous crossover. a good agreement is found between the calculated and experimental stress levels in a deep silo and a population of experiments on average strain profiles, though the precision of the experimental data on the asymptotic behavior is not sufficient to warrant a detailed comparison of the model. the behavior of mesoscopic granular stresses can be studied by examining the correlation between average stresses and cell size for a wide range of inhomogeneous materials. the characterization of these fluctuations can provide insight into previously poorly understood phenomena in the granular sector, such as the role of boundary conditions on the stress spectrum, and the relationship between stress structure and boundary conditions. berg and purcelles, _ statistical mechanics of granular media _ ( clarendon science, new york oxford university press, 2003 ). j.c. bohr, _ introduction to non - cohesive and disordered systems _ ( john wiley & sons, 1983 ). i. introduction 1. methods : numerical -rangular dynamics of stress fluctuations 1. general -
we demonstrate that the h@xmath0 detections along the stream of magellanic clouds can be understood in terms of shock ionization and heating in a transsonic ( low mach number ) flow. for the first time, the balmer emission ( and associated emission lines ) provides a diagnostic against which to judge the credibility of n - body / rayleigh - taylor gas codes for explaining gas processes in galaxies. using three independent hydrodynamical codes, we solve the equations of gas dynamics for the stream using the _ fyris _ ( sutherland 2008 ) and _ ramses _ ( teyssier 2002 ) codes and find that the warm ionized skin of the stream is sandwiched by a warm neutral medium with a mean particle temperature of @xmath1 k. the latter is typical of galactic halo clouds and likely represents the warm accretion towards the inner parts of the galaxy. we infer that the inner regions of the halo are hot enough to create optically thin ` ` layers '' of ionized hydrogen and helium, entrained in the warm halo gas, and thus likely to contain significant amounts of matter with the same atomic hydrogen column density. the warm, ionized gas moves with radial velocities in the same direction as the stream, so that low - ionization emission lines ( e.g. balmer ) are expected to be preferentially excited at the shock interface, but the signal is still dominated by the post - shock region. we suggest that the stream clouds have suffered a sequence of accretion episodes as they are ablated or ` ` ` cascade '' shocks into the hot halo medium. the early in the cascade phase ( i.e., within a few kpc from the cloud center ), the released gas accretion is cold, dense and unstable, and it is likely to be confined by the tenuous external medium. we discuss the fate of these clouds and suggest avenues for future research. to support our model we apply it to the smith cloud, one of the most luminous and rapidly - rotating clouds in the galaxy, and show that its properties are consistent with a location of its interaction with the galaxy at the intersection of the galactic magnetic field with the stream.

in this work, we explore the radio - x - ray correlation and the fundamental plane for black hole ( bh ) sources from sub - eddington to quiescent state in low / hard ( lh ) state of xrbs and bright low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ). we employ a large sample of bh sources ( @xmath0 ) from the palomar - nearby galaxy survey ( panoramic survey of galaxies and regions ) which cover a wide range from ob - associations to local group galaxies. we find that the bh - loud agns tend to follow a shallower radio x- ray correlation compared to the bhs in lh state, where the power - law component is larger and the radio emission is more dominantly coming from the jet. however, several ` outlier'bhs with large radio - loud excess ( fr is ) are found which seem to defy the simple adaf - jet model prediction. based on the comparison between fr is and other bh subsamples with similar bh mass, we argue that the fr is with relativistic jets may be intrinsically different from the other bhs, which supports the idea that the x - rays - to - radio correlation ratio is dominated by the jet rather than the accretion disc. we also find a much steeper radio xx ray correlation for sources with large edddington ratios ( @xcite ). by fitting the entire sample with the doppler boosting model, we show that the fainter bhs tend to have lower values of the ratio compared with the others, which may be due to the possible different radiative transport in the two populations. the results are further supported by the analysis of a small sample of llagns where we find an agn - like correlation which is roughly consistent with that found in the whole sample.

we discuss the properties of a selected sample of nearby active galaxies contained within the search radius of uhecr events detected by the auger collaboration for gamma - ray sources up to @xmath0mev energies - ray satellites and ground - based cherenkov telescopes. this sample is dominated by low - luminosity agn ( seyfert or liner types ) of the liner and seyfer class, and a few radio galaxies, all of which are thought to be capable of accelerating supermassive black holes ( uhecrs ) to ultrarelativistic energies. we study the host galaxy properties, the source distribution, the structure of extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields, the nature of sources ( transient vs. steady ), the energy spectrum and chemical composition at injection, and the presence of intense non - thermal emission lines from relativistic jets emanating from the active centers. the full sample of 54 active galaxies is further distinguished by the detection of one active radio galaxy and several other objects with emission - line signatures, and by the identification of four powerful radio galaxies which could be potential sources of high - energy cosmic rays. assuming typical agn properties, we find that : ( i ) the distribution of arrival directions of the highest energy sources is highly anisotropic with respect to agn ; ( ii ) the mean spectrum of the sources is better fit with a multi - color model than with a single component black hole power - law ; ( iii ) the chemical composition is in general poorer than that of the local universe ; and ( iv ) the origin of the emission lines is most likely multi - phase accretion disk with the majority of them likely tracing the supergalactic plane. the statistical significance of the correlation between arrival direction and agn for individual sources is discussed, and it is concluded that the correlation is probably a coincidence. future work by other groups may investigate the implications of such an identification of sources which may be able to accelerate cosmic rays to ultrahigh energies.
we consider the underactuated mechanical control problem with a virtual holonomic constraint @xmath0. the goal is to stabilize the orbits of the reduced dynamics while preserving the invariance of the constraint manifold, in particular, to prevent the transient behaviour that might lead to repetitive configurations. we show that the optimal solution to the vhc - based orbital stabilization problem involves augmenting the dynamics with a double - integrator. we provide a general theorem relating the stability of a closed orbit to the controllability of a linear periodic system, for which we give an explicit representation. leveraging this result, we design a feedback loop to exponentially stabilize the orbit relative to the manifold in order to maintain a certain speed profile. + + key words : self - regulation, self - intervention, open dynamics, regularity there is a considerable interest in the study of out - of - equilibrium dynamics. an early and important observation of @xcite center for nonlinear dynamics, department of physics, university of illinois, urbana - champaign, il 61801, usa. a problem that arises frequently is the stabilization of equilibrium states that are macroscopic in nature. it is well - known that a system that is stable in a harmonic oscillating mechanical sense ( e.g., in the oscillating harmonic oscillators ) is always stable in the harmonic oscillator state, in contrast to the state that is usually unstable in the dynamical sense. henceforth, it has been asked what conditions a given system has to meet to have an _ exponentially stable equilibrium state _, i.e., a closed statespace such that for any value of the system is stable. one of the conditions that have been discussed in the literature is that the system must be homeomorphic to a regular curve of diffeomorphic to either the unit circle or the real line. this is known as the _ closed orbit problem_. in the case of systems of linear, periodic, or quasi - periodic forms, the closed - loop state is stable for long periods of time, in interesting ways, because almost all orbits are essentially closed. however, it is not known in general that the same is true for systems that operate in a nonlinear regime, in other words, for any system that operates in a stationary state. this paper provides a general solution to this problem if and only in the context of convex regular systems. in turn, our solution determines the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a locally lipschitz continuous feedback, such that the conve
we review the analysis of cp violating phases for normal ( inverted ) neutrino ordering and show that they are viable for both no and io. the majorana phases acquire quite small values for no, however, for io the lower limit of phase @xmath0 is considerable higher than that for no. in the cp violating scenario, for both the mass orderings we find that the matrix belonging to class a is ruled out for io, whereas, for class b, one finds a significant survival for both these matrices. pacs numbers : 12.60.jv, 12.15.mm, 14.80.cp it is now well established that neutrinos are strongly interacting particles that generate so many interesting effects in nature @xcite. one of the most interesting aspects of these interactions is the so called cp ( cp - violating ) matrix. a vector variant of the charged lepton, wherein the cp is described by a mixing matrix of three flavor mixing angles, is a very efficient vector. it has been observed in many experiments that when one intentionally tries to optimize a flavor mixing angle, the resulting cp matrix has a large impact on the efficiency of the resulting experiments : e.g., the sensitivity of the phase diagram to the choice of which flavormixing angles one should choose is quite impressive. in this scenario, one often ends up with a very large phase diagram, whereas the actual value of the mixing matrix does not occupy a large space at all. hence, it is very desirable to have a tunable phase matrix which allows one to optimize the quality of the experiments while at the same time having a constrained phase graph, which makes it possible to obtain useful constraints on various cp violating parameters. the cp(14 ) matrix is one such matrix. however, despite its great success, the fact that it is a diagonal phase matrix is still very difficult to solve for a pure flavor mixing case. from the perspective of cp violation, there are two options. the first one is sustaining the dirac - like cp violating phase, whereby the mixing angles for the different phases are close to each other and hence, one may have to deal with an intermediate phase. the second option is the reverse of the above two, wherein there is a majorana phase in the vertex space, which prevents one from obtaining useful constraints even for the full mass ordering. here we review the results of this study and also provide some perspective on the constraints that should be placed on these phases. in section [ sec : strategy ], we summarize the experimental information
we describe a method for finding _ linear _ modes of uniformly rotating perturbations in stellar disks. this strategy heavily relies on existing techniques, such as the matrix method and fourier expansion along the unperturbed orbit. it is proposed to be very efficient in the centre of the disk, since only a few expansion terms need to be calculated. the problem is reduced to the choice of a suitable set of potential - density pairs in order to model the full perturbed distribution. we present the description of this method, and we show that, in the case of no inert halo component, the resulting models are in excellent agreement with the recent n - body simulations by athanassoula & sellwood. we also describe a more simple strategy for searching for the corresponding linear modes, by comparing the pattern speed of the perturbation mode counts and the disk anisotropy. stellar disks are massive, self - consistent idealized objects which have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. these objects are dark halo components, which extend much further than the visible component. the most important criterion for the stability of a disk is its global potential, which must be as small as possible. this criterion can be achieved by either perturbative theory or numerical methods. in both cases, a reliable value of @xmath0 is usually assumed. in this paper, we will present a set of stellar disk models for which the global potential can be obtained exactly. these models are designed to be in the plane of the exponential disk growth. the emphasis will be on the dependence of the stability on two important parameters : the velocity dispersion of the galaxy and the halo to disk proportion. the models will also discuss the effects of a softened gravity. the initial setup will be a two - dimensional axisymmetric kuzmin - toomre galaxy, which is assumed to be hot and has a three - dimensional structure. the disk itself is supposed to consist of a bar - shaped central part and losely wound spiral arms, which are always found to be trailing. the numerical models for this set of models will be presented in a later paper.

we investigate rational homology cobordisms of plumbed 3-manifolds. as a motivation, we explain why these graphs are of special interest for link concordance problems. we give a proof modulo a technical result of ours which will be postponed to the next section. we state the main results in this paper. let @xmath0 $ ] denote a _ plumbing graph _ on a 3-sphere, for which we use the term ` ` plumbing graph '' in place of the usual ` ` intersection lattice '' used in the literature. we show that there is a natural extension of the notion of a plumbing graph to the class of intersection lattices. a _ dual building block _ of the second type is a subset of a _ good subset _ for which the number of irreducible components is zero, i.e., each of the building blocks is distinct from the others in the good subset. we call such a subset _ modular _ because the nodes are disjoint union of connected linear graphs, and we associate each node with a separate _ building block_. a good subset is said to be _ reducible _ if there exists a deformation of the graph such that the vertices of the full graph are all connected and the interior of the vertex space is isomorphic to the full complement of vertices. we study certain good subsets and methods for deriving them are described in detail. we prove certain basic properties of these subsets, some of which are left out in the current proofs. we also obtain some new results on good intersection forms and methods. this will lead to a partial reconstruction of the proofs of the main result. we leave the description of these methods to future papers. in the end we give an independent and shorter proof of certain of these results and we make some comments on the generalization of the results to other realizations of rational homeomorphic subsets. * rsum ( in french ) : * there is an extensive literature devoted to the study of riemann surfaces. see @xcite and the references therein. the goal of this paper is to describe, in some detail, the possible classes of manifolds that can be produced by branched double covers along slice links in the theory of seifert fibered spaces and to answer some questions about their structure and combinatorial complexity ( section [ mainframe ] ). we do not intend it to supplant, but, instead, to supplement and clarify a long - standing problem raised in @
we study the qcd polyakov loop in the vicinity of two phase transitions : a chiral phase transition and a deconfinement phase. we show that the screening masses of the two order parameter fields behave differently near the respective transitions, and that a new structure emerges in the parameter space of the effective theory near the transitions. the structure is of the form of a drop in the screening mass of one of the fields, and a rise in the other field screening mass as the phase transition is approached. in a previous paper @xcite we have shown how the chiral / deconfining phase transition in qcd can be characterized using the mechanism of phase coupling introduced via the @xmath0 symmetry. in this paper we extend this analysis to the case of a qcd with two massless dirac quarks in the adjoint representation. here the global symmetry is broken via the bilinear quark condensate. the resulting potential is a non - order parameter field which acts as a heavy field for chiral symmetry breaking. we study the properties of this field in lattice simulations as well as in tree - level lagrangians. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 043issn 0418 - 9833 + march 2010 * qcd in the phase with two flavor quarks * hirotaka irie@xmath1, benettin _ _ institut fr theoretische physik _ _ humboldt universitt zu berlin _ _ + _ invalidenstr.110, d-85747 garching, germany _ _ pacs _ : 12.38.bx, 12.39.gp, 14.40.hq m_z ( submitted to physics letters b ) _ quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a powerful tool to understand the phase diagram of qcd. in particular, lattice qcd offers a platform on which the parameters of the theory can be studied in detail, thereby opening new avenues for the study of the fundamental many - body theory at the single quark level. lattice data on qcd offer a wealth of information about the low energy physics in strong coupling. it is well known that in the low coupling regime, the low - energy physics is dominated by the dynamics of the dirac fermions, which are the lightest quarks. the confinement experiments on the d- and/or dirac lattice offer a good opportunity for
we demonstrate how the displacement of individual atoms in a solid can be used to obtain atomic - scale information of the phonon density of states of a two - dimensional material, extending the work of gregora and co - workers [ phys. rev. lett. * 105 *, 080502 ( 2010 ) ]. our study is based on transmission electron microscopy ( tem ), which has the advantage of allowing uniform isotope concentrations over the beam area. the resulting information is combined with raman spectroscopy, which provides spatial resolution and can take advantage of the atomic - resolution in tem. we developed the efficient ` frozen phonon'approximation and carried out a measurement of the out - of - plane mean square velocity of a single atom in a unit cell. this technique can be easily extended to other low - dimensional materials, including hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides, with potential applications for atomic mass spectrometry and information about van der waals heterostructures. the propensity of crystalline materials to develop chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) structures that are geometrically thin yet show a large number of vacancies@xcite is well known. in such materials, the vacancies are from phonon band structure and not from metallicity. as a result, it is not possible to determine the dispersion relation directly from the size of the sample, making it difficult to distinguish the phase diagrams of the precursor material from the ensembles of carbon atoms forming it. however, optical and near - infrared imaging can provide information on the distribution of the vacancies, if enough energy is available. these imaging techniques have the disadvantage that the wavelength of view is comparable to the atomic radius. thus, for optical observations, diffraction must be taken into account, along with the assumptions that the sample is well isolated from the environment and that there are no defects or lattice defects in the sample. while optical imaging provides a starting point, the long - standing problem is that the resolution of silicon - on - insulator ( tof - sims ) microscopy is generally not accurate enough to directly measure the density of isotopes ( particularly for small grains ).
in arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) magnetic field, phase mixing of harmonic alfven waves ( aw ), propagating in plasma, results in their fast damping in density gradient regions, while magnetic perturbation energy continues to grow in time. previous studies have established a distinction between two types of aw dissipating modes : ( i ) those for which the damping is monotonously increasing with time, whose time evolution is prescribed by resistive evolution of the abc background magnetic field ( ubmf ), and ( ii ) slowly dissipating aw packets whose damping time is as short as the resistive time, with dissipation time scaling of @xmath0. here we study full three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations using lare3d ( lagrangian remap ) code, and derive the first results for small - amplitude aw packets in non - linear mhd equations in 3d spatial dimensions. we found that, in the presence of gaussian pulse, damped aw packets propagate in the density gradient regime faster than their amplitude counterparts, and also attain higher damping energies. the surprising result is that in the case of the gaussian aw the increase of amplitude does not affect the aw dissipative time evolution, while for the harmonic aw the effect is reversed, as expected. we conjecture that this could be due to the inverse cascade of magnetic energy - conversion efficiency. however, we see no evidence for such a cascade. interestingly, in both the cases are found to have the same damping length, depending on the amplitude of the aw pulse, whether it is harmonic or gaussian. the numerical simulation results also show that oscillatory behavior of the waves is markedly different in the two cases, when the wave amplitude is increased or decreased with time. this can be attributed to the different mathematical structure of the generated flows, which have similar mathematical structure to the wkb reduced version of mhd.
the koszul complex, due to noether, is the study of _ infinitesimal _ gauge symmetries of non - commutative vector spaces. in this paper, we explore the context of the batalin - vilkovisky complex, a group of algebraic structures arising from the duality between algebra and geometry, which was initiated in noether s ` anti - bracket'and the ` looking glass'approach to the homotopy cosmology. due to the original field - anti - field formalism, the proto - bracket was often expressed in terms of dirac delta - functions. motivated by analogies to the jacobi identity for the gerstenhaber algebra, we extend the algebra of local functions @xmath0 to a simpler yet effective representation, that is, a polynomial algebra for small values of the graded commutativity parameter, j^\infty \phi)^*l(x, u^{(p ) } ) d{vol}_m = \int_m { \mathbb z=0 } \end{aligned}\ ] ] the result is a graded quasi - bracket and a ( pseudo-)bifurcation of the bracket to a differential graded algebra. the bracket thus obtained combines with a product, that we began with, to yield a product on the space of solutions of the euler - lagrange equations. this product in turn gives rise to an algebraic structure analogous to that originally introduced by noether from the ` field'viewpoint. in particular care is taken of the relations between the product and the lagrangian, which are indexed by the local functions in question [ q_v ], although the algebra in question is not ( as far as i know ) associated with the jet bundle, which is rather extensive in the jargon of jet theory. the remainder of the paper is devoted to a more traditional ` bi - lingual'( math and physics ) presentation, giving an english translation of the original one. the original language of @xcite is in perfect agreement with the translation in the expanded language. for the sake of concreteness, i keep the translation using the original rather than the revised language.
we present high resolution ( r @xmath0=200 km s@xmath1 ) observations of the nucleus of the active elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 ( cen a ) obtained with the integral - field spectrograph at the gemini south telescope in the near - infrared, using the f606w and f814w filters. the observations reveal a nuclear disk - like structure, in addition to the well known large scale jet - induced star - forming region. the nuclear disk is seen in both the [ pii ] and [ feii ] emission - lines. the kinematics of both lines are remarkably similar in appearance and suggest that they are produced in the same gas cloud with a well defined and uniform sense of rotation. comparing the orientation and amplitude of rotation of the lines with the zavala - velocities of @xcite and a tilted ring model, we suggest that at small radii the line - of - sight passes through a warped disk, which is consistent with being zero in both position and velocity. on larger scales we observe departures from a standard warped disk geometry, such as from the e w axis in the central 1 - 2, and a warp in the disk on scales of at least 2 - 3 kpc. the [ ne vii ] line shows a more complex kinematic structure, with a region of high velocity dispersion in the east part of the region. we argue that this could be associated with a bar - like perturbation of the disk, as pointed out by previous studies. the position of the east emission blob coincides with the location of the kink in the radio jet and is in projection, suggesting a possible association with the jet. we confirm the presence of a central black hole, at the bottom of the potential well, and we postulate that the black hole mass is increasing in size and decreasing at a constant rate from north to east. we report the first accurate measurement of the central 0.1 - 0.2 m radius. assuming that there is a suppermassive black hole at the nucleus, we find that the estimated mass - to - light ratio, and the inclination, are in good agreement with previous measurements, and support the hypothesis that the nucleus is warped.

we study the orbital kinematics of dynamical neutron stars ( dns ) in the galactic disk at the time of the second supernova explosion. to this purpose, we perform a monte carlo simulation of the motion of _ all _ observed dns in our galaxy ( including psr j1906 + 0746 ). each system in the population is assigned a velocity equal to the vector sum of the local galactic rotational velocity and an isotropic kick velocity generated from the kick velocity distribution function. we then derive probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of the natal kick velocity and the spin tilt of ns1 for each of the observed systems. for ns2 s progenitor mass of @xmath0 m@xmath1, which is a convectional limit for a helium star that explodes in a core - collapse supernova, we restrict our analysis to the regime of a secondary star that is about 270 km / s from the birth of the binary. the only constraint on the post - birth mass of ns2 is that it needs to be more massive than 2.1 m@xcite, while the constraint on ns1 spin tilt angle requires that it must be smaller than 1.4. these constraints are combined with the constraints on the mass transfer occurring between ns1 and ns2 at birth, which also tightens the constraints to a lower value. we apply the 2-dimensional joint probability distribution for the present - day orbital inclination and the angle of the orbital ascending node to determine the dns initial orbital semi - major axis and orbital eccentricity. for those systems where these properties have not been measured yet, we achieve these goals by taking advantage of the accurate up - to - date kinematic parameters of dns. we also predict the unknown radial velocity of each system, as well as the total transverse velocity and ns1 spins tilt angle of those dns that have not yet been found.
we consider new global fits to flavour physics data in scenarios with generic np contributions to @xmath0 observables, as defined in ref. @xcite. in all cases parameterized by two - dimensional ( 2d ) profile likelihoods, the 2d likelihood is found to be in good agreement with the standard model ( sm ). we find that chirality suppression is needed to partially reconcile the discrepancy between the cdf and lhcb results in the year 2011. we also study scenarios without np, but with large contributions to the @xma0 mixing amplitudes, and find that this scenario is consistent with the sm prediction of 3.6@xmath1. finally we discuss the implications of a scenario where we postulate large np effects in the _ standard_-decay - mode of perturbative qcd. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * new perspectives on flavour physics * + * c. bona _ et al. _ ( # 1 ) + ( # 2 ) # 3. j.r. lunghi and f.h. soni * + dipartimento di fisica, universit di roma ` ` ` la sapienza '', + p.le aldo moro 5, i-00185123 rome, italy + e-mail:r.s. alexander.manhart@gmail.com + * g.i. best. jr. * + _ deutsches elektronen - synchrotron desy, + notkestrasse 85, 22607 hamburg, germany _ + * preprint arxiv : 1112.1726 _ the enrico fermi institute for nuclear research, department, technische universitt mnchen, + james - franck - strasse 1, d-85748 garching, belgium _ we are submitting our manuscript entitled ` ` constraints on new cp violations, '', to be published in the proceedings of the ieee workshop on quantum chromodynamics ( 2012 ). u.n.acknowledges support for dpartement de physique thorique ( imsp ), + universitat autnoma de barcelona, + & 08193 bellaterra ( barcelona ) spain.
we present the results of our deep, 184.7 ks _ chandra _ observation of the lynx field north ( hdf - n ), obtained on 2000 september 02 in the hard x - ray band and covering the central 56@xmath0 56 of this field. we reach a total integration depth of @xmath1 per square degree, which is two orders of magnitude fainter than previous studies with the nasa / esa s _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). the field is sufficiently deep to permit a detailed cross - correlation between the optical / near - infrared imaging data on the one of the largest scales probed so far in x - rays. we find that 18 of the 18 x -ray sources in our sample are spectroscopically identified with late - type galactic dwarfs. seven of these are early - type and five show evidence of star formation. our deep observation is matched in both sensitivity and resolution by deep, wide - field optical images from the _ rosat _ deep cluster survey ( rdcs ). we use these images to determine the hardness ratio, implying a range of possible star formation rates for our sources. two galaxies are shown to be very similar in redshift and spectral type. we discuss possible origins for the emission - line galaxies cxo164 and cxo221, and conclude that they are probably associated with galaxy groups in the virgo and fornax clusters. a possible host for the other two galaxies is proposed to be a low - redshift, obscured agn. we present an approximate estimate of the fraction of the cosmic ray background that is resolved into discrete sources, which shows that the sources with known redshifts are among the brightest sources in this field at present. we also present results from recent work on large - area galactic surveys, reaching a median 0.6 magnitudes in flux and luminosity, and discuss the prospects for future advances in these surveys in the future. one source with previously unknowns is discussed in the context of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) studies, in particular the possibility that it may be a radio galaxy.
we present an analysis of optical and x - ray data on the spectacular gaseous nebula surrounding the infrared - luminous merger / starburst system arp 299 (= ngc 3690 or mrk 171 ). the bright, spectacular nebula has a total luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 and a global infrared - to - optical luminosity ratio of about 3.2. it is surrounded by a luminous halo of 0.2 kev soft x - rays that is strongly absorbed by the cold interstellar medium and thus is most likely powered by stars, with the optical nebula likely being powered by ob stars or supernovae. the nebula is well - collimated and appears to be in the late stages of accretion ( collision ), although it could also be the result of the tidal interaction of gas ejected by the merging galaxies. we have measured the thermal spectrum of the hot ( 0.77 kev ) medium - temperature ( mekal ) gas in a region 4 kpc in radius and find that it is highly ionized and likely produced by thermal gas thermalization ( shock - heating ) of ambient gas. the equivalent width of the 0.4 kev 0.5 kev emission line ratio correlations clearly indicates that a large fraction of the gas in this region is heating up in the atmosphere of the merging galaxy pair and hence must be incorporated in the global fit to the optical emission - line nebula. we delineate two possible sources of the ionizing radiation that may be the primary source of energy flux of the warm gas. one of the two thermal components is superimposed on the cold gas, while the other is likely to be an agn with an output power exceeding the eddington luminosity by a factor of 3. we also present an estimate of the terminal velocity of the outflowing gas, which is generally consistent with the theoretical predictions of a superwind model. a rough dynamical age of 25 myr is derived for the system. we discuss various implications of these results for the future evolution of this gas, including the possibility that the hot gas may be able to escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy.
new indipendent analyses of the @xmath0 endpoint spectrum are presented. the first one is based on a large semileptonic events reconstruction efficiency, a large signal events acceptance, and a still competitive signal over background ratio ( s / b ). the latter achieves a low signal and detector modeling dependence. the analysis is done using the distributions of the invariant mass of the hadronic system in the recoil of a fully reconstructed b meson. the final analysis is performed by means of a differential branching analysis that allows to distinguish different theoretical models and different decays. results obtained by using hqet and ope for inclusive decays ( 13 % precision measurement ) and by a first attempt of discriminating theoretical models via differential analysis for the exclusive decays are discussed. * desy 09 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * independent analysis of * * the endpoint spectrum * * s.c. b. agrawal@xmath1, s.a. belogianni@xhotmail.com * * h.m. albrow@dept. of physics, university of durham, durham dh1 3le, uk. + e - mail : bhamra@dhu.ac.uk * + * key words : * deep inelastic scattering of baryons in the relic hadron production region ; hadronic matrix elements ; b - factory era ; inclusive and exclusive determinations of ckm matrix element ; lepton and hadron physics * * preprint * the ihep collaboration : + contributions to the d1 project from : + the cern, p.o. box 51, fi-00015, israel pacs numbers : 12.60.hi, 13.85.fv, 14.80.ly * abstract * + _ title of program : _ desy - hadron collider _ + _ version : _ ( 0.2.2 ) + _ program obtainable from : _ + the institute of high energy physics, fermilab, th division, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland ( see application form in this issue ) + e-mail : _ daillant@physik.infn.it + _ licensing provisions : _ none + _ programming language : _ fortran 90 + _ memory required to execute with typical data : _ 200 kb + _ no. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc. :
the discovery of type ia supernovae will open up a new window on the cosmic star formation history. upcoming surveys will map most or all of the sky at great depth, and thus are able to observe a large fraction of these events. these surveys will, for the first time, observe a nearly all - sky supernova population up to very high redshifts, releasing a huge harvest of cosmic supernova data. in this paper we make a brief review of the supernova discovery potential for upcoming surveys, and assess the impact synopic surveys will have on core - collapse supernova astrophysics and cosmology. we particularly focus on the implications for supernova light curve evolution, from the epoch of peak supernova activity, to years, and ultimately to supernova flux limits down to @xmath0. the primary observational boost to these surveys comes from their ability to recognize and follow up on many of the faintest and most redshift - accessible objects in the universe. for example, the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) will obtain redshift maps of the entire sky every 14 hours, yielding a catalog of more than 300,000 faint, unmodeled objects. the sdss will produce digital photometric maps of large areas of the celestial sphere and thus provide a new benchmark for comparison to ongoing and future sky surveys. as these surveys scan extensively, their discovery rate will grow by factors of tens to hundreds of millions year to years. the resulting data will be fed directly to the scientific community, forming a ` ` supernova database '' ; the resulting catalog will have a profound impact on our understanding of supernova phenomena and cosmic evolution. we perform a preliminary supernova supernova forecast for the upcoming eso small magellanic cloud ( csnr ), centaurus a ( cfrs - i ), and the james webb space telescope ( jwst ). we find that the combined data set will provide unrivalled evidence for a long - term dependence on survey limiting magnitude, and for the integrated supernova rate over the entire redshift range.

we study unitarity properties of non - commutative quantum yang - mills theories on a noncommutative space - time. in the first part of the paper we extended the work of @xcite to gauge theories, studying the one - loop level analytical structure of the vacuum polarization tensor ( @xmath0 ) for pure spatial ( magnetic ) and time - time ( electric ) theories. in order to check unitarity and gauge invariance at the quantum level, we recast the usual feynman rules into a more general form using the standard f(r ) gauge theory. the results are compared with those obtained in the usual case and extended in the magnetic case. we show that cutkoski s rules are satisfied by considering only physical branch cuts : the spectral densities related to transverse polarizations are explicitly determined, although being realized through an oscillating behaviour, and the possibility of recasting the full theory in terms of a variable _ a priori _, which can be continued analytically, in spite of the locality, is discussed. from the point of view of dispersion relations, we find that the presence of a new kinematical variable _ i.e. _, a wilson loop, is a clear signature of unitarity, although its amplitude is exponentially decreases in the large-@xmath1 limit. the case of temporal dispersion is also discussed, emphasizing in detail the violation of lorentz covariance, through the appearance in the amplitudes of new poles through a novel transverse dispersion relation, of the established for the pure spatial case, while for the electric case a positive _ eigenvalue _ of the loop is obtained. finally we deal with the problem of the wilson excitation as a function of a non - trivial landau - tau phase, and we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the singularity probabilities for _ non - abelian _ excitations. next we consider the generalization of the problem to spatial geometries and, in particular, to string theory. for the first time we explicitly consider the explicit expression of the self - energy of the _ full _ yang mills theory on the basis of perturbation theory and show that it is consistent with cutting - off the loop at the moyal phase. we finally discuss the generalizability of the results and extend the result of the simple analysis to higher dimensions. 4.5 mm = -1 mm citex[#1]#2@fileswaux
this paper establishes the equivalence of a @xmath0-factor and a von neumann algebra in the context of the homology theory of finite dimensional complex vector spaces. in the case of a graph with at least two edges, we also give a simple proof of a conjecture by corollary 5.7 of the conjecture. the point of the paper is to provide a direct analogue of the analogous result in @xcite for an arbitrary finite - dimensional perron - frobenius eigenvector. the problem we address here is the following. we are given a graded, unital, associative von neuman algebra ( or, equivalently, a subalgebra of a unital differential geometry class ) equipped with a trace ( or product ) on the collection of paths in a complex vector space, whose composition defines a representation of a path in the set of equivalence relations. we associate the representation of such an algebra to the projective geometry class associated to the path. immediately we notice that the previous assertion is accompanied by a multiplication in the same category. by induction, the parity assertion holds and further, the new multiplication is shown to be equivalent to the previous one. for general vector spaces that are infinite - dimensional, the main result of this paper is as follows. we take the diagram of the intersection of the two subalgebras described above and construct a new homomorphism, called a transpose, between the original path space and the new representation. the new construction begins by normalising the trace so as to be invariant under the kronecker lagrange transformation and then proceeds by constructing a product between the two in a self - similar way. a comparison of the results with previous work shows that the original conjecture is essentially identical. for a large class of vertex - connected graphs, the situation is more complicated. the main results in this paper are the following : [ pacs : 89.20.ff, 89.75.+b ] we present a proof of the ( conjecture - theoretic and computational ) conjecture that the quantum colouring of a finite dimensional ( infinitely - dimensional ) perron perovskite - type vector space is equivalent to its classical counterpart and, employing the process of annihilation by projections, we show that this equivalence is compatible with the earlier conjecture [ p3 ]. the proof relies on local graded probability theory and relies on some results of corollaries 4.7 and 4.5 of @xcitethat the local graded quadratic theory of
we investigate the physical connection between the dynamical state of a galaxy, determined by its assembly history, and its photometric properties, by characterising the tully - fisher relation ( tf relation ) for spirals, and the faber - jackson relation for ellipticals. we build a sample of nearly 9000 galaxies with information on luminosity, circular velocity and central velocity dispersion, selected from the galex arecibo sdss survey. we find that the slope of the tf relation is a strong function of morphology, and that it relates to the total ( disk plus bulge ) mass - to - light ratio inside the half - light radius, @xmath0, directly linked to the fraction of random over total motions inside the galaxy. for spiral galaxies, we show that this parameter is a good proxy for morphology and can be used to define a three - dimensional hierarchical model that describes the structure of galaxies regardless of type. in this model, the galaxy is modeled as a fully rotationally supported bulge and disk, so the disk stars are dispersion - free. the galaxy total gravitational potential is parameterised as a function of both type and galaxy rotation curve shape, so that the tf relates to both galaxy dynamical and photometric quantities. the model produces the following distributions : ( 1 ) the high end of the fundamental plane ( fp ), tracing the bulge - disk relation, ( 2 ) the sc types, ( 3 ) the intermediate and low surface brightness types, and ( 4 ) the most luminous, long periodical sb and sa types. the space between these three distributions is described by the so that sc types are well represented by sb / sa galaxies, and thus the morphology dependence of the fp is well described by a baryonic fp. the novelty of our analysis is that we take advantage of a full semi - analytic hierarchical model based on croton et al. ( 2006 ), that can incorporate secular evolution and hierarchical mass assembly and model galaxy formation. we argue that this model is ideal in the case of large galaxy surveys, where a visual inspection is impractical ( for instance at high redshift ). we discuss our findings and present our findings directly in the context of disk galaxies.

we report the serendipitous discovery of a nearby sub - damped ly@xmath1 ( ) absorber with an absolute metallicity of [ o / h ] = @xmath0 = 0.00632. this absorber is situated in the outer reaches of the virgo galaxy cluster and is part of the ngc4261 galaxy group, which is known to have hot intragroup gas from detection of diffuse x - ray emission. the overall metal abundance of the system is surprisingly low ; we find [ z / h]= @xfig1 and [ si / h]@xfig2. these are among the lowest metallicities measurements _ in the gas phase _ known in the nearby universe. the absorber exhibits few if any excesses over the galactic standard. oxygen and silicon abundances are comparable to those of nearby giant regions and distant dlas, but the abundances of nitrogen and magnesium are lower than those of most nearby galaxies. we find that the nitrogen abundance is similar to that of nearby dwarf galaxies and that the abundance patterns of iron and silicon are similar to those in high - velocity clouds in the milky way. we examine the possibility that this dla arises from self - enrichment in the dwarf galaxy ; if so, then the dla must have undergone at least two recombination episodes with embedded massive stars before it becomes visible as an absorption line. we also examine the implications of a low - density dla over the history of the universe and on the possible evolution of dla metallicities. under the assumption that nearby hot stars contribute to the ionizing radiation in addition to the flux from background quasars, the models indicate that the baryon - to - dark matter ratio in the sub -dla is increasing at a constant rate of about 1.7 every billion years. if this trend extrapolated to higher redshifts, then it would require the existence of massive stars in the minihalo to provide the necessary input to the galactic equation of state.
i review the state of current status of stellar population studies in the milky way ( mw ) and local group ( lg ). through painstaking work, i have been able to review the major scientific issues within the context of @xmath0cdm, including ( 1 ) the proper motions of mw satellites and their kinematics, ( 2 ) the morphology - density - morphology relationship within the lg, ( 3 ) the central cusps puzzle, where there is growing evidence that the mcs may be on the verge of transformation from a dirr - type system to another class of dwarf system, ( 4 ) the missing satellites problem ", where missing satellites that were originally identified as dirrs by klypin et al. ( 1999 ) are found to lie near the mw, due to a coincidence of fortuitous timing in the dynamical evolution of the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) and their parent lg system, and ( 5 ) the apparent discrepancy between the observed and predicted spatial distributions of lg dwarf galaxies, particularly in the outer parts of the halo. in this review, i will highlight some of the research topics that will be addressed in future work, with an emphasis on the area of _ resolved _ stellar populations that are now, and that will likely be, addressable as stellar populations work in the industrial age " of resolved lg stellar populations, a time where the power of automated analysis of these vast databases will be brought to bear on both newly revealed as well as age - old problems in the field. ultimately, this review will highlight the major advances that have been made in our understanding of stellar populations in the local group and their relation to structure formation in the hierarchical universe today. # 1 # 1#1 # 1 2_#1^#2 # 1_#2^#3 # 1eq.

we present new results on the detection and analysis of the intracluster light ( icl ) in the massive intermediate redshift cluster cl0024 + 17 at @xmath0 based on wide field images obtained with the large binocular camera on the lbt. the icl has been observed in the cluster core using a sloan digital sky survey zeropoint combined with archival data from different science images covering a wide field of view. the total integrated icl emission within 150 kpc of the cluster center can be described by a broken power law with a break at 200 kpc where the break is due to a stellar tidal stripping of the brightest galaxies from the cluster potential well. we have estimated the fractional contribution of this diffuse icl to the total cluster light using a combination of surface counts and faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function normalized to the cluster counts within the virial radius. the radial profile of this icl is consistent with the distribution of sloan r and sloan i magnitude functions, although the fit parameters are slightly flatter than those obtained from fitting composite samples of clusters at different redshifts. the profile is also consistent with that derived from fitting schechter laws for two samples of galaxies dominated by a single mass population having similar physical and dynamical properties. thus the mass - to - light ratio derived from these two samples is close to the values empirically observed in clusters, in agreement with theoretical predictions of n - body simulations which assume that the dominant galaxy population is made up of stars stripped from the halos of their parent galaxies. the amount of total mass lost by stripping is less than what is predicted by the two cluster luminosity functions ( in terms of total stellar mass and luminosity ), but is significant on smaller scales. simple predictions in cold dark matter scenarios based on cdm scenarios suggest that a significant fraction of the stellar mass is lost from galaxies that are members of the inner regions of galaxy potential wells due to the stripping action. the inferred icl fraction depends on the properties of the local galaxy sample but is independent on the assumed dark matter density profile.
we present results from new observations of chromospheric activity from six sun - like stars with hot jupiters included in our cfht / gecko campaign. all the stars have planets with orbital periods @xmath0 with periods between 2.2 and 7.1 days and are tightly - orbiting, chromospherically active late - type stars. we have observed three of the six stars in a search for evidence of their planet - induced activity using the high - resolution chelle spectrograph, espadons. two of the stars, hd 179949 and hd 217107, display low - level activity that is well - correlated with the hot jupiter s orbital period, in agreement with previous work. with the addition of the three new targets, we now have six stars with known periods in our survey having less than 1.1 day of rotation. from the period - to - activity comparison, we find a correlation between the ca ii h and 8662 emission lines which are well - fit by a truncated alfvn wave model. with cfht data spanning 5 years, we observe significant short - term and rotational modulations of the stellar activity, in particular during the nights when the planets are both in the chromosphere and along the magnetic field lines. in addition, we have noticed a significant increase in the he i d3 absorption feature on each night that each of the two stars displays its maximum ca ii emission, which is the signature of rotational modulation. we interpret this trend as evidence of the presence of a cooler, thicker disk, analogous to those reported for the case of canum venaticorum, which are thought to be fingerprints from planet - planet interaction. if our interpretation is correct, the equatorial chromosphere of our three targets is slightly cooler than that of hd 209458, which has an upper temperature of 0.8@xmath210.3 k. we detect a weaker modulation of the h i d absorption that is likely due to damping by the planet s tidal drag. if the trend is interpreted as due to spi, these stars offer the best chance of observing the effects of planetary magnetic fields on the activity of their chromospheres at the earliest stages of the 11-year solar cycle.
the connection between the physics of magnetic impurities in superconductors and majorana bound states ( mbs ) in the presence of quantum fluctuations is investigated in detail. a recent theoretical work considers a linear chain of anderson impurities on a superconductor as the minimal model that might explain the phenomenon of yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) bound states, that appear owing to pair - breaking effects that magnetic moments have on superconductivity. this mbs are predicted to appear as zero - energy bound states in effective spinless p - wave nanostructures, such as the ones resulting from the combined action of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting in nanowire devices. we discuss how this picture is modified by the normal - state lead, which not only widens the sub - gap bound states into resonances of finite width, but also leads to additional kondo screening that generates an additional spectral peak pinned to zero frequency. this results in a significant change in the character of the zero - bias region in the phase diagram. using a diagonalization scheme, the critical temperature at which the zeeman energy of states above the gap @xmath0 for both normal and superconducting leads is determined. we find a condition for the system with a doublet - singlet cross - over between the ` ` singlet '' and ` ` doublet '' regimes that can be empirically distinguished from the case of a single site. we also provide an analytical expression for the condition for zeeman - induced parity crossings of states crossing the doublet at arbitrary ratio of the fermi energy, and provide a detailed derivation of the necessary for a non - bcs ground state, as well as for a topological phase transition to occur in this hybrid system. in addition, we study the effect of finite external magnetic field and external quantum fluctuations on the mbs and the mab parity system, and discuss the conditions for its existence and symmetry. the study of mbs proximized by proximizing quantum dots provides us with an important tool to understand the crossover from weakly interacting to strongly interacting systems. the complete phase diagram of this system is computed, which provides a complete picture of how the ysr bound states cross each other and can be reconciled with the shiba band picture of majorana states. the full set of results can be downloaded from the authors at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s037015731400
we study a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, with periodic boundary conditions, treated as a wigner quantum system. in fact, we show that the two systems have solutions in terms of the lie superalgebra @xmath0. in the same system, we also determine the eigenvalue spectrum and eigenvector counts of the position operators, for any of its eigenvalues. for a problem of non - zero constant, fixed wall boundary conditions lead to a different type of transform, instead of a discrete fourier transform, and a discrete sine transform. this implies that the algebraic solutions will be similar, even though the conclusions about physical properties will be different, for example due to the different numerical values of the numbers. [ tab : crit ] ] from this point of view, the results are in good agreement with the theoretical expectations. in particular, the first and last oscillators ( those fixed to the wall ) oscillate less strongly than those away from the wall. all oscillators have the same position probability distribution in the periodic boundary case, as they are all equivalent ( completely symmetric on a circle ). for the case of fixed wallial conditions, the behavior also follows the classical properties. the position with highest probability ( for each oscillator ) is the equilibrium position resulting from commutators with strongly decreasing probability. the positions corresponding to the middle of the spectrum ( i.e. the ground state ) are the most stable ones. on the other hand, the positions close to the surface, far from the equilibrium, have a more stable distribution. we also show some interesting properties of the energy spectrum ( spectrum of position operators ) of the system. these are similar to those of the fock representations @xcite studied in the previous paper. finally, we determine the critical value for the coupling constant in the chain with fixed wall conditions.
we present observations of the strong o@xmath0vi absorber at @xmath1 toward the qso pks 0405123, using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ), the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ), and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). this absorber is among the strongest 5 % of the low - redshift baryons known to be in a warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ), with measured ionization states of nev, mg, o, and si. we discuss a range of possible ionization mechanisms, including photoionization of the absorber, collisionally - ionized gas, and hot gas that has cooled from high temperatures in a non - equilibrium manner. we identify a number of metal - line absorption features in the high resolution fuse and stis spectra. one feature is possibly due to the combination of _ fuv _ and _ stis _ observations. the large spectral coverage of these two datasets allows us to identify and study five ions in the system, including two likely members of the whim, three likely distant gas tracers, and one possible member of the igm. three of the ions are not detected in the x - ray spectrum, while the two that have been are in the uv. the four ions may be tracing cooler gas associated with the whim. we place an upper limit on the temperature of this hot gas, assuming the metagalactic ion is thermal equilibrium. if the metals are not photonic, the only plausible explanation for the detection is that we have detected a relatively hot gas component, and if this is the case, the baryonic mass in this part of the universe is substantially reduced. we present an estimate of the amount of hot gas implied by the abundances of these metal ions, and find that it is not possible to simultaneously account for the abundance of these elements in a photoionized absorber and a background absorber.
we have studied the near - uv nuclear spectra of 20 seyfert galaxies, using stellar population templates in the range @xmath03600 - 4100. updated morphological classifications have been developed in order to account for recent star - formation episodes in the nuclei. synthetic spectra, derived from the caii k line and the w line, are compared with the observed spectra. we find that recent star formation episodes can be detected in two out of the 13 galaxies with well - defined spectral features. these episodes are found to be more frequent in the nuclear region of agn s than in the star cluster region, and to be associated with enhanced star formation in the bulge of these galaxies and in the compact star - forming objects ngc1386 and mrk607. we have also constructed models combining the typical bulge template with a 10 % mass contribution from a 1gyr stellar population. for the five sab, sb and sbc s, ngc7582 presents the hobl signatures of a nuclear starburst, while ngc6890 and mcg5 - 27 - 13 have the characteristic bulge features of a young stellar system. the contribution of this young component to the spectrum, as measured by the equivalent width of the nuclear h@xmath1 emission line, is larger than that of the old stellar component. we conclude that for the most of the sample galaxies, the continuum flux of the young component is a featureless power - law, and that it could originate in a starburst of a very young age, younger than 10myr. however, we found that when one subtracts an elliptical galaxy template from the spectrum of a galaxy containing young stars, the young continuum is still present and can be partially explained by scattered light, as in the case of the sab s and the sc s. in some cases, due to a larger than 1 % contribution in flux from an intermediate age stellar component, it is possible to discriminate between the stellar components discussed above and other stellar populations, even if one does not remove the starburst component completely. the problem of distinguishing the nuclear starbursts from the background stellar populations or nebular emission and the stellar populations mentioned above can be solved by comparing the values of the emission line and caii line intensities as a function of age and metallicity. if this method works, one will know immediately which stellar populations are contributing to the observed emission line strengths. # 1to 0pt#1 # 1 # 1 to size #
we show that the universe was reionized at redshift @xmath0 by population iii ( pop iii ) stars and the initial mass function of the pop iii stellar mass function may have been top - heavy originally due to the rapid hydrogen recombination time. we indicate that the high density of the intergalactic medium at this point results in a much more rapid and earlier cooling phase of the supernova blast waves, emitting a large fraction of the cooling energy in x - rays. the combined x - ray emission from these two sources is sufficient to enable efficient 2 formation and cooling in the cores of minihalo galaxies in the redshift period in question. an important process for producing a large number of 2 molecules in relic hii regions of pop iii galaxies is quantified. it is shown that 2 molecules produced by this process may overwhelm the lyman - werner background produced by the same stars in the same photo iii galaxies. as a result, the ly@xmath2 background may never have never built up in the first place. we suggest that star formation in minihalos can continue to take place largely unimpeded throughout the first reionization, in contrast to the case of large halos where star formation is really taken care of. in addition, we use a new computational method to track the entire igm, including hi regions, hi cores, and partially ionized regions. we show that if the star formation efficiency in the early universe was more than ten times higher than in today s universe, 2 would have never been able to accumulate significantly above the ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at high redshift. consequently, we conclude that the positive feedback mechanisms due to 2 formation allow star formation to continue to operate efficiently in mini - halos during the entire pop iii era. we discuss the implications of this new scenario for the evolution of the dark matter and the formation of clusters of galaxies.
we study the accretion disk around @xmath0 car using the x - ray properties to deduce the orientation of the semi - major axis. a recent model by parkin et al. ( 2009, p09 ) was built to fit the rosat p - cygni light curve. we compare the findings of this model with the ones made by corcoran & soker ( 2005, apj, 545, l127 ), who showed that the light curve can be fitted by using almost any periastron longitude and any inclination angle. our calculations also include the effects of the undisturbed primary wind as well as the shocked primary wind. we find that the emission measure of the hard ( p@xmath1correlated with the hard component that is observed in the rxte data ) emission is unique among all calculations. for constant winds properties, the volume of the shocked secondary wind is found to be sufficient to cause the mass loss rate to increase by several orders of magnitude compared to our previous calculations. this force the mass outflow to increase in the polar directions. we suggest that the source of the polar outflow is either a collimated polar wind ( or two jets ), or a shock - induced wind. to discriminate between the various orientations of the two models, we made use of a periodicity dating back to 5.54 years to study the effect of the orbital separation. we found that the column density toward the secondary star is too high to account for the observed column density for our preferred orientation. instead, the mass accretion rate that is formed by the accreted primary wind, is too low to explain the high column density alone. we also studied the properties of the hot gas. in contrast to previous claims ( e.g., phekelidze & parkin 2009 ), we show that some of the observed soft ( p, cr)/ hard ( h ) emissions are due to emission from close to apastron, and suggest that this component is radiated in the wind.

the launch of several satellite radio facilities during the next decade is expected to provide independent, complementary views of the sky, and they will be crucial for full exploitation of the lsst data products. a community workshop was held in charlottesville ( 2013 may 68 ) to discuss the science themes of radio astronomy and the radio components of multi - wavelength sky surveys. the workshop was structured around two science themes, with several topics discussed that were relevant to both topics. these include ` ` co - observing, '' probabilistic detection and classification of sources, and the approach toward deep drilling fields. the topics covered in the workshop included a discussion of how to maximize the scientific output of the ongoing facilities with time - domain observations, both ground and space - based, and how to obtain useful follow - up information in the ongoing search for time - dependent signatures of transients. temporal radio transients have a long history, dating back to the 1930s, and have been detected in a wide variety of astrophysical objects including massive star - forming galaxies out to @xmath0 and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the early universe. in recent years, a new class of transient events has been discovered in which the radio emission is _ coherent _ ( e.g., synchrotron ), _ incoherent _ in emission, and possibly incoherent in emission ; the class of which is referred to as ` ` ` transients ''. the rapid detection of such transients carries significant implications for the search for extragalactic radio sources. of the known transients, only a few have been discovered at radio wavelengths. for the transient class, the estimates of the radio transient time scales and the number of events detected suggest that the peak timescales for detection can range between a few tens of seconds and a few days, depending on the magnitude of the propagation effects. the timescale for rapid response depends in a complex way on the ` ` duty cycle '' of the transient, regardless of whether the event is coherent or incoherent. it is not clear at this time whether there are other relevant modes of emission that can lead to similarly high detection rates.
we show that any classical circuit composed of controlled - not gates can be parallelized to logarithmic depth by adding ancillary ancillae to it. this is useful for parallelizing circuits composed of any number of gates that act on a single qubit, since they can express any diagonal unitary operator on the target qubit. we extend the recent results of clemens _ et al. _ [ clemens, rev. mod. phys. * 57 *, 203 ( 2000 ) ], who showed that @xmath0 can be achieved in a family of reversible boolean circuits similar to those at mit for reversible classical computers. we generalize this to the case where a set of controlled-@xmath1 gates applied to a given target quantum device have mutually commuting ancilla. we find that any diagonal operator on a quantum circuit can be further parallelized by composing them in pairs and then uncoping them together to reduce the circuit s depth to zero. we also find that while diagonal gates can only do one of the following two tasks, when all the gates are diagonal they can perform both tasks separately. that is, we show that while a circuit can perform any parallel circuit with only one non - zero element in each row and column, these can accomplish both tasks simultaneously by performing them in parallel. it is interesting to note that the same group of results applies to any circuit that has an exponential number of degrees of freedom, and there does not seem to be any discrete topology in either of the two topology classes. [ 2 ] they are related to the theory of topology of quantum circuits, and it seems natural to ask whether any set of discrete polynomial - degree - of - freedom unitary operators ( e.g. the aperiodic morse sequence, which sums up the degree of freedom of a given by a given set of eigenfunctions of an unknown hamiltonian @xcite ) can be combined to obtain a parallel circuit. the simplest way to do this is to fan out copies of the inputs into multiple copies, and then to uncopy the ancilae ( see figure [ switch1 ] ). however, doing this fan out is often prohibitively difficult, since one needs to do it in a large number of layers or by solving a non - linear algorithm in 6 layers. as a result, it is not clear whether such an implementation is possible ; it is likely that the desired implementation is not possible, or is harder than it seems. however
we present new, high spatial and spectral resolution images of the central @xmath0 of the sgra * ( galactic centre ) cluster obtained with the keck - telescope and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). with these new images we report the discovery of a radial anisotropy in the velocity distribution of the early - type stars in the galactic centre. the mean ( 0.1 - 12 ) line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the entire sample ( r@xmath1 ) is consistent with isotropy and the distribution of velocity dispersions is bimodal, with the exception of one star ( irs 16 c ) that show strong tangential anisotropies. this star is a bright, isolated hei emission line star. from its position in the doppler shifted spectral line we derive a proper motion for this star and another star with a radial proper motion. with the addition of another 17 stars that are detected in the proper motion we now have a total of 113 stars with measured radial proper motions. from this sample we can determine the velocity components of the components of rotation and tangentiality in the plane of the sky ( _ r _ ) and derive an upper limit on the rotation axis of the stars. the results are consistent with a model in which the stars are rotating as a group, but with a rotation axis lying in the air and some of them on very tangential orbits. this rotation is probably caused by the fact that the extended star clusters, like our own galaxy, tend to be formed early in the life of each stellar system. the net angular momentum of this central sub - cluster is estimated to be in the form of mass, but this quantity is sensitive to the assumed central mass concentration. we model the orbits of the fast moving stars with a central mass of 2 to 3 million solar masses and find that orbits that are tangential on the sky plane ( on plunging, elliptical orbits ) but that are highly anisotropic on the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid. this suggests that the black hole potential around the central black hole is already in place and that this central mass dominates the stellar density in each of these clusters. if we assume a power law imf and apply the leiden / thomson luminosity function to the stellar volume, we find that the central mass to light ratio of the dynamical to stellar mass enclosed within the central stellar volume is close to unity. a black hole of mass @x
we summarize our analysis of hcn ( 1 - 0 ) observations of four high @xmath0 sources from the literature, with the goal of studying the relationship between hcn luminosity and far - ir luminosity for objects at high redshift. three of these are optically selected ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ), three are known to contain active galactic nuclei ( agn ), and one is a submillimeter - selected galaxy originally identified as a spheroidal galaxy. the hcn observations were made using the very large array ( vla ), through the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the green bank telescope ( gst ), with mjy sensitivity at 1.4 and 5.8 ghz. for three of the sources we derive ir luminosities using a modified black body model for the source spectral energy distributions ( seds ), while for the fourth object we assume a standard concordance cosmology throughout. all sources are characterized by strong thermal ir emission with a critical density for excitation of the lower co rotational transitions of only a limited range in temperature ( 10@xmath1 to 40 k ). the infrared luminosity is then determined by integrating over the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source, using the local temperature grey body code of beelen et al. ( 2004 ). we find that the ratio of ir to hcn line luminosity ranges from 1/4 to 1/10 of the co luminosity in the most luminous star - forming galaxies, as in lower luminosity galaxies. for the three systems that we present data on, hcn emission is associated with, or is detected in conjunction with, either, an agn, a compact black hole, or a seyfert nucleus. given the low temperatures of the dust, which are typically traced by co, these hcn - emitting galaxies provide a measure of the rate of star formation that is linearly proportional to the mass of dense ( ie. hcn- emitting ) molecular gas, but not to the total molecular gas mass. we discuss the implications of this finding for the formation of massive starbursts and the evolution of the accretion rate in these objects. regarding the case of iras 10214 + 4724, observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained with the space telescope science institute, which is operated by aura, inc..
we present a surface brightness and color analysis of galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts ( z @xmath0 0.272 ) from the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ). our sample consists of 72 galaxies in the f450w, f606w, and f814w filters taken using wfpc-2 and nicmos cam3 cameras. we examine the effects of the point spread function ( psf ) on the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies in order to more accurately classify galaxies in morphological categories. based on the color profiles, we find that galaxies possessing logarithmic radial surface brightness gradients ( such as disks, spheroids, and ellipticals ) are slightly more concentrated to the center of their stellar populations than their de vaucouleurs profiles. moreover, the majority of galaxies in our sample have central surface brightness gradient profiles which are brighter than 0.5 mag ( or 1.12.0 magnitudes overall ). as we look further back in time in time, our color profiles indicate that the star formation regions are more centrally concentrated and their morphologies are more irregular, deviating from the traditional hubble sequence. we discuss the possibility of mergers and interactions as the cause of the trends seen. we compare the observed trends with the predictions from the semianalytic model of galaxy formation that includes star formation, hierarchical structure formation, and mergers. while the latter model best reproduces the observed comoving number density, star formation rates, internal velocity dispersions, and star formation rate density of the lbgs, it fails to reproduce the observed luminosity function, and cold gas and metallicity abundances in the universe. therefore, we conclude that galaxies at high redshift must be undergoing mergers or else they are evolving into ellipticals and/or s0s.

we investigate the lc of type iip, type iil and type iin supernova remnants powered by radioactive decay ( including sn iin ) using the hybrid " model " to account for the observed diversity in the luminosity functions of type ii supernovae ( slsne ). given that many of the recently discovered slsn events that seem to be surrounded by dense, optically thick shells, a unified " model for the lcs of these events is needed in order to explain their properties. we present a detailed analysis of the large parameter space of potential lcs and provide solutions for the cases of homologously expanding ejecta ( with and without radioactive decay input ), a csm shell plus a particle - mass ejecta interaction ( magnetar spin - down ), as well as a variety of csm and radiation - hydrodynamics parameters. in the light of the first law of thermodynamics and the diffusion approximation, we approximate the basic lc models of a80, 82 by a top - hat " model in which a constant shock heat input is provided for a finite time, extends for time and then shuts off. to be specific, we consider the input to be a shock with constant luminosity, @xmath0co, and thus producing a maximum in a very short time - scale. we then explore radioactive decay, shell - shocks and, within some limitations, several combinations of these power inputs. the most general question we propose to explore is whether or not the heterogeneity of the current sample of slsn iil / iin lcs requires very different progenitors and physics, or if there is some common theme expressed in different ways. we also test the hybrid model with radioactive decay to determine the optimum parameters from the models to fit the data for the slsn 2006gy template and discuss implications for the sn ii classification scheme. we find a characteristic fit of the hybrid ejecta - csm interaction model to the observed shape of the sn iip sn 2009kf for which a characteristic density profile is derived.
observations of pulsars hint at a kick to the neutron star from the progenitor star. the magnitude of the kick depends on the complexity of the supernova explosion, and may be as large as @xmath0, for short - lived systems, or as small as a few times the pre - supernova core mass. the kick may be produced by either gravitational perturbation of the ejecta ( after core bounce ), or by off - centered electromagnetic dipole emission from the nascent neutron star. in the latter case the kick is likely to be located in close orbit around the central, massive neutron star, its companion star, or even the ejected mass itself. in some scenarios the companion may be found to have a mass close to the minimum stable mass for helium - like nuclei, and therefore the kick can be explained by gravitational deformation of the core, or rotational averaging of the momentum impulse. a point that was previously overlooked is that the minimum mass for cold still - lepton - rich matter is much higher than the value for cold catalyzed matter, and this opens new evolutionary pathways. in this paper we try to depict a scenario that may account for the high kicks observed for pulsars. a long - term goal of pulsar physics and astrophysics is to understand _ natal _ kicks, the special conditions required for their reliable description. we study the processes that may give rise to such kicks at the time of neutron star birth, and conclude that the concepts put forward by imshennik & popov are insufficiently explored in the present day. address = department of physics & astronomy, ms-108, rice university, p. o. box 1892, + houston, tx 77251 - 1892 address = max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik, giessenbachstrae 1, 85748 garching, germany address = nasa goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 20771, usa, altaddress = space telescope science institute, 3700 san martin drive, baltimore, md 21250 address = universities space research association, national space science and technology center, huntsville, al 35812 usa
we provide new estimates of the local black hole ( bh ) mass density and the bh mass density accreted during bright qso phases. the observations are based on the 2df qso redshift survey and the large sdss qso survey. by extrapolating the qso luminosity function to the luminous and faint ends, we obtain the luminosity density of bhs in local galaxies and the distribution of bh masses in early - type galaxies. these data provide us with the distributions of velocity dispersion and luminosity in nearby early - types. we find that the growth of high - mass bhs mainly occurs during optically bright qse phases, where the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency @xmath0 of luminous qsos is larger than 0.1. we also find the presence of type ii bhs with masses in the range @xcite, where luminosity and velocity dispersions are tightly correlated. this result is consistent with the adiabatic growth model, in which the total bh area and entropy are conserved during bh mergers and mass is radiated away as gravitational radiation. we argue that more massive bhs can not be formed from low - mass agns and that the fraction of obscured agns needed to match the x - ray background is too high. on the other hand, we provide new constraints on the rate of formation of new bhs by assuming that the eddington luminosity is the limit at all redshifts. under this assumption, the formation of at least one new bh is predicted in the local universe within the next 10 gyr. if this model is confirmed, this bh growth will contribute more to the cosmic bh budget than has been proposed so far.

the new code for stellar evolution, mesa ( modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ), contains a very large amount of data on the life and structure of the star. it can evolve stars with a very wide range of initial masses and metallicities and is continually tested by hundreds of scientists and students all over the world. in addition, several researchers have created codes and routines to simplify its use and to make it more universal. the goal of mesaface is to provide a fast and simple access to all the information contained in the output of a mesa run. though it is relatively easy, and for some purposes sufficient, to analyze the data in detail, a detailed analysis of the mesa output is much more challenging. it would be useful to have a simple way to access the data _ dynamically_. in order to do that, either from the hard - drive or from the web ( or both ), one should select the corresponding profile, each file referring to a specific age, and save it in some particular variables. the code accesses, manipulates, and presents the data through a graphical interface, which allows the selection and usage of the information through buttons and menus. a separate user manual explains how to use that. in this paper, we describe the code and the basic features of the interface, as well as the commands that can be used to control, manipulate, and visualize the data. we end by showing some examples of graphs, that show how the information to be shown in the interface can be customized by the user.

we present synthetic spectra of the new t ( methane ) dwarf gl 229b that probe the refractory elements in the near - infrared and optical, focusing on the lines of the alkali metal lines of cesium, potassium, rubidium, and sodium. these lines are the first spectroscopic constraints on the low - temperature, high metallicity atmospheres of the t dwarfs to include the effects of the ubiquitous k i resonance doublet at 7700. we use the new spectra to calibrate high resolution models of the absorption features in the k i doublet, and show that the red wing of the doublet is largely responsible for the steep redshift of the @xmath0 band flux, which is attributed to the effect of the pressure exerted by molecular hydrogen. moderate resolution spectra are presented for four different models of absorption, taking into account the line blueshifts of the na d and h@xmath1 lines, the influence of the [ na d lines at 5890, and the distribution and relative depths of the ( and ) bandpasses. the ratio of the strengths of the sodium atomic lines to the potassium and rubidium lines allows us to determine the temperature at which the condensate begins to leak out of the atmosphere, and we refer to this process as rainout. we show that in the l dwarf range, with or without rainout, the atmospheric alkali metals are found to be buried below the condensation level. accordingly, precipitation " is expected to be a key feature of any t dwarf atmospheric model, and thus may be the key to understanding the rise of the methane fundamental band above a temperature of 10,000 k. we compare the t and l dwarf spectra, as well as the observed properties of the sdss 1624 + 00 star, with such models, and find that they match each other at low temperatures and metallicities. however, lower k and cs abundances for the sloan dwarf or a shallower abundance distribution at higher temperatures can not be ruled out. hence, in light of the uncertainties in the gravity, the interpretation of the data may be dumber to the true abundance distribution within the von neumann limit. a parallax for this new t dwarf will be a crucial prerequisite for future substantial improvements in characterizing it.
we present a numerical approach to the calculation of the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) from chiral effective field theory ( eft ) three - nucleon interactions at n@xmath0lo. the implementation of the mathematica code consists of ( i ) the automated tracing of spin - isospin matrices and ( ii ) the re - expression of the hf energy in terms of the scalar / vector - isoscalar / isovector parts of the one - body density matrix. such a method will allow for proton - neutron mixing in the future. from the outset, we briefly review the steps that have led to today s understanding of nonlocal densities and the complications that arise in their construction. we then describe how the method can be extended to include the effects of multidimensional integrals, which appear to be essential in the case of high - energy nuclei. in a subsequent publication, we will present the mathematical solution of the embedded python program that gives access to the entire output of the program.
we present @xmath0 mk@xmath1 of time - stream data from the subaru / xmm deep survey ( sxds ) at the calar alto millimeter observatory ( cso ), collected at the end of 2003, during three observing runs at 143 and 268 ghz. the data were taken with the bolocam camera, which is operated at the cso. from the 143 ghz data, we find a deficiency of photon noise relative to a model of the atmosphere that uses a spatially uniform power spectrum for atmospheric water vapor fluctuations. we identify this deficiency as due to an excess correlated noise between the time - streams of adjacent bolometers that is not predicted by the karlsson - taylor ( k - t ) model. we demonstrate that the data can be explained by the fact that adjacent detectors are separated by less than the smallest possible size of a spatial mode of the electromagnetic field ( em ) field that propagates through the optical system and arrives at the focal plane. the physical separation between adjacent detectors is the dominant factor driving the em - field overlap, which produces the correlated noise we find in the data. by removing the atmospheric noise from the data using an adaptive principle component analysis ( pca ), we are able to recover the blip performance on scales where the atmospheric signal is largest ( _ i.e. _, at low frequencies between 1 and 10 hz ). we find that the range of the resolution in our pca analysis is approximately 200 arcmin / sec at the north - eastern ( nw ) side of mauna kea, and is 25 % or more behind sensitivity at the south - pole. however, we note that this result is subject to uncertainties that are generated by a few percent of non - zero atmospheric noise in the high - resolution images of the south pole. we also present a comparison of the angular - velocity profiles of the atmospheric blips observed by acbar at the galactic center with our data, which suggests a relatively unsophisticated common - mode assumption for the atmosphere. on the other hand, our data indicate that the average column depth of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere is monotonically increasing with the height of the cloud. we thus suggest that the distinction between the high- and low - altitude regions is partially due to the differences in the spatial structure of adjacent detectors.
semiconducting heterostructures based on silicon, including nanoporous si, have recently attracted a great deal of interest due to their unique properties such as high performance, low cost, excellent optical quality and excellent mechanical stability. here we review recent experimental results obtained in the field of semiconductor electrochemistry which clearly demonstrate the important role played by current bursts in the generation of different kinds of active structures - nanopores, mesopores, macropores and so on - that can be tailored to describe a broad range of properties of the material. in particular current bursts are a promising tool to stabilize continuous oxide growth in nanoscale systems against an electrochemical attack. we describe an explicit method to determine the local characteristics of current bursts and their interaction with the surrounding oxide layer and this allows to disentangle their influence on the formation of different surface morphologies, including the pore walls. the possible creation of synchronized current bursts can be explained by the use of a current burst - model which takes into account the effect of oxide dissolution and the subsequent self - organization of the pores upon current penetration through the oxide layer. in this model large numbers of tightly wound, tightly wound pores are formed due to an interaction between current and oxide, resulting in an efficient control of the amplitude of the current through the entire pore system. we review the present experimental observations and discuss the main ingredients required to explain the current burst mechanism in a coherent way. silicon is a well - known material with a strong electrical conductivity for good conductivity @xcite. the transition from a conductive to an insulating state as a function of temperature can be induced by an applied voltage. in the last decades silicon has been the material of choice for many photovoltaic devices due to its excellent mechanical properties and excellent optical stability in terms of conductivity and low cost. recently, a large amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to the growth of nanopores on silicon surfaces under an intense industrial demand for high performance electrochemically active nanoelectric devices and high mechanical conductivity ( hv ). the fundamental process of siliconian organic oxide growth is well understood and the effects of various monitoring and control parameters ( such as current density, applied voltage, thermal conductivity, particle number,... ) can be roughly classified into three classes. the first one : ( a ) synthesis and characterization of a single pore, ( b ) determination of the local average current density and the diameter of all the pores and their patterns ; ( c ) determination
we present the results of an extensive study of the evolution of thermonuclear flames in periodic domains under the influence of a constant gravitational field. the flame surface is considered to be rayleigh - taylor unstable, leading to a growth of initial perturbations. we follow the flame s development through an extended transient phase and find a well - defined steady - state regime where the evolution is self - regulated. the time - averaged turbulent flame speed is independent of details of the flame microphysics. we find that the initial transient phase, characterized by large jumps in density, total velocity, or progress variable, is adequately described by the standard khokhlov subgrid - scale model. to verify this, we modified the original model and developed a new model based on the kolmogorov turbulence theory described by a finite - size, gas - phase model. in the steady state, the driving and turbulent scale lengths are no more than a few times the grid width, and the mesh begins to evolve to match the flame structure. the new model includes a flame front tracking scheme to guide the flame through the transient phase. using this scheme, we study the time evolution of the reactive eulerian equations in cartesian geometry and find excellent agreement with the numerical solutions obtained with the flash code. the majority of the models presented here are computed in three - dimensions, while a limited number of models have been calculated in two - dimensions. we use flash s adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability and only resolve regions actively participating in combustion. in these regions, we track flow structures in an extended, continuous phase of turbulent expansion that does not depend on the laminar flame speed. also, we find a smooth relationship between the strength of the rt and froude instabilities. the origin of this relationship is the interplay between the driving scale and the turbulent surface brightness. we evolve for a long time before the self - regulation mechanism has been fully established. our study provides a foundation for the improved scheme.
the discovery of long - duration grbs ( events which last less than @xmath0s ) has broken the standard classification scheme of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) into ` ` short '' and ` ` long '' events. this has opened the door on a new grb classification scheme ( ` ` canonical grb '' ) that straddles both long and short bursts. grbs with such a ` ` hybrid '' morphology, where the peak of the afterglow coincides with the initial spike, have a significantly smaller peak luminosity than the p - grb one. as a consequence, these grbs have been assigned to be ` ` fake '' short grbs. here, we unveil how such a classification scheme could be reversed, revealing that grbs, instead, inherit their hard - to - soft behavior from the environment. we argue that all grbs should be considered as originating from the gravitational collapse to a black hole, characterized by a peculiarly small average value of the circumburst medium ( cbm ) density ( compatible with a galactic halo environment ). grb 060614 is a perfect test case, revealing an imprint of the black hole formation, a very small cbm density and an extremely hard spectrum. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 [ # 1 ] # 1#2#3 _ the messenger _ # 1 ( # 2 ), # 3. ` ` # 1 '' ( # 1 ) # 2 = 0.65em.3ex-.7ex.7ex gev mev ev kev tev s_w c_z m_pl _ _ astron. n^g_w s^2_w _ astr. arc. phys. _ l_. l^4_#1 _ a#2_#3_-phys. rev. _ d.bolmatov@xmath5, j. z. borot _ et al. _ _ ( submitted to astron. astrophys. j. _ ) _
we report the results of first - principles calculations of the magnetic excitations in three - dimensional fcc ni. the calculations are based on the maximally localized wannier basis, which provides a more efficient basis to study local correlations than extended bloch states. the matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential are calculated entirely from first principles. in order to reduce the computational cost of the calculation we exploit a form factor method which takes the form of the reduced - vertex and vertex - vertex coupling, in which the electronic degrees of freedom are mapped onto the classical itinerant - electron problem. the exchange coupling is calculated within constrained density - functional theory with exchange parameters obtained from time - dependent density functional theory calculations. the energy spectra of the collective spin excitations are calculated by the first - principle method in the @xmath0 $ ] direction in the brillouin zone. in general, the obtained results are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. we focus especially on the material with the largest exchange splitting among the 3__d _ _ ferromagnets, bcc fe, and ni. we show that the exchange splitting has a strong influence on the appearance of the double - peak structure in the spin - wave dispersion curve of ni. in particular, a reduced exchange splitting increases the magnon - peak wavelength by 0.1 ev in each step up to one - half of its original value. the major part of this increase is due to the increase of the two - particle stoner - excitations with increasing exchange splitting in the lsda calculation, which changes the spectral shape from stoner excitation energies in the low - energy band to mlwfs in the high - energy bands. our approach can be applied to more complex magnetic materials with many atoms per unit cell, such as magnetic tunnel junctions or giant magneto resistance devices. = 10000 + * keywords * : spin waves, excitations, excitons, multidimensional systems, solids, dft, constrained density function, e. g. weber state key laboratory of condensed matter physics, department of physics, state university of new york, stony brook, ny 10027, usa
we use the theory of ray representations of the inhomogeneous galilei group to provide an explanation for the loss of particle - like information that was observed by drr, nonn and rempe in the experiment of scully, englert and walther ( dnr ) in 1998. the scattering amplitude of the incident photon was found to be independent of the position - momentum uncertainty relation. the explanation is based on the use of unitary irreducible representations of this group. this theory can describe atoms in different energy levels, as do f and g, but the first pair has negligible overlap with the second pair. the essence of our explanation is that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics has an invariance group, which is the same as that of the cosmological theory. the theory also predicts phenomena that can not be accounted for by the dnr explanation. several new experiments are then proposed to refute the rejected explanation. the first is the _ own - goal experiment _ experiment ; when an atom of mass @xmath0 is placed in an atom interferometer, interference is built up between the incoming and outgoing waves, and the atom is taken into account by noting that it is reflected in the incoming wave. the second experiment is a variant of the drr - nonn - rempe experiment ; it has an extra generator, and includes a quantum eraser, which enables it to distinguish between the gaillei invariance and dnr explanations. it is performed in the same way as the first experiment, but differs in some details. the aim of the present paper is to provide a theory that can fit the experimental data independent of any notion of complementarity. the problem that dnr found is that, in the interference region, the atom taken in a resonant cavity does not interfere with the atom when the which - way detector is used. the uncertainty principle prevents the introduction of unphysical particles into the interference plane, even if they travel along the same path as the atom ; in the absence of scattering, the interference pattern is no longer possible. our theory strongly suggests that the experimental results of dnr can be reconciled with our present - day understanding of the phenomenon if we use the correct values of some of the parameters of the theory. # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in.125 in.25 in
we have conducted a deep ( rms @xmath0 1.2 mm ) interferometric survey at the max - planck - millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) with thempifr, mpe, and nrao groups at the ntt deep field with the mambo plateau de bure mm interferometer ( pdbi ) and the vla. we have measured positions, bolometric luminosities, and deep bvri imaging of three of the brightest ( s@xmath1mjy ) mm sources in the ndf located in a region of the north - west field dominated by the faint sub(mm ) population. the 3 mm sources are detected at the flux levels of mambo in both the radio interferometry and the k - band. milliarcsecond - scale positions are derived for two of the mm sources, mmj120517 - 0743.1 and mmj1407.05 - 0740.1, from the pdba and vla maps. the estimated positions and fluxes of these sources are consistent with those determined by the optical / near - ir counterparts we have found in the literature. it is difficult to account for the flux and optical luminosity of these mm sources without including the effects of extinction since they are so faint and their optical to infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are peaking in the far - infrared. the multi - wavelength photometry is used to place constraints on the redshift, luminosity, and seds of these bright ( sub)millimeter sources. assuming that the sources are at the same redshift as the local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ), that is based on the comparison of their seds, this suggests that these objects are either heavily obscured starbursts / agn or are high - redshift spheroids. the high obscuration would be difficult to maintain such high star - formation rates over many to many dynamical time scales. in either event, the required gas accretion rate and timescale would be comparable to or larger than the current accretion rates of massive disk galaxies. thus, these sources would require massive gas inflowing in response to the feedback from stellar winds and supernovae. we discuss our results in the context of previously suggested hierarchical merging scenarios.
we present a new approach to the study of the formation of massive star formation in dense regions. the approach combines self - gravity, hydrodynamics, particle splitting, and sink particles, and studies the interplay between particle splitting and the jeans criterion, the requirement that the minimum number of particles for cloud fragmentation is @xmath0 particles per cubic meter, and the efficiency of particle removal by sink formation and accretion onto sinks. we have performed three numerical simulations of a simulated version of a cluster of galaxies in the vicinity of a massive protostar. the simulations have an initial total mass of @xcite, a mass function of up to 1000 solar masses, and an initial protostellar core spectrum that varies with time and environment. the most important new features of these simulations are their ability to reproduce the typical properties of low - mass star formation, including the frequency of star formation peaks and the formation rate, mass assembly histories, and feedback from star formation on the evolution of the ism. we also show that particle splitting can lead to a better understanding of the mass assembly history and final structure of the cluster, and may lead to the discovery of interesting processes that would not occur in a cluster with much fewer cores. 99 t. rosenberg, _ galaxy formation _ ( wiley, new york, 1977 ). d. w. ebbesen, _ stellar dynamics _ ( princeton university press, princeton, 1995 ). l. m. nielsen and i. l. chuang, _ astronomy and astrophysics _ ( university of california, los angeles, 1994 ). e. baring, e. bean, t. flotte, m. hartmann, and r. miller, ` ` ` assembly of molecular clouds in the intergalactic medium, '' j. phys. a : math. gen. * 37 *, 651 - 654 ( 1966 ). p. coulter, _ the origin of dust in the early universe _ ( academic, 1975 ). c. marois, b. macintosh, p. barclay, c. pogue, and c. dumont, _ introduction to the techniques for the simulation of interstellar matter _ ( crc press, 1998 ). a. j. tyson, _ principles of particle - mesh refinement _ ( sph, 1999 ). g. d. ladd, r. f. nordholt, f. e. maestre, and
we present cs j = 54, 32 and 21 transitions of cs and c@xmath0s in low - mass star - forming regions located in the regions of massive star formation. the data were obtained with the iram 30-m telescope at pico veleta, spain using the 3-mm, 2-mm and 1.3-mm receivers tuned to single - sideband mode. in the j=54 transition, we detect the j = 76 emission line at a flux of @xmath1jy in the spectrum of the ionized gas. the spatial distribution of the intensities of the lines varies from about 0.1 to 1.8 jy. there is no significant correlation between the position of the transition and the column density of the gas. however, the data can not discriminate between a single column density or a two - column density distribution. we find that the difference between a detection and a non - detection is more related to volume density than to the volume density. this result confirms our result that the star formation rate per unit mass of dense gas rises dramatically in the part of the cloud with dense gas. we compare the results of our study to those of other regions and other galaxies in a similar survey. the densities calculated for sources in our survey alone are seriously affected by cosmic - ray ( cs ) optical depth, although the effects of opacity and uncertainties in kinetic temperature on the results are comparable. from the analysis of the entire dataset, we conclude that j=76 should be detected in about 10 regions or so. in addition, we note that the data are well - matched to models of very dense gas with a temperature of about 50 k, as expected for a mixture of gas at different densities. we examine the ability of models with varying densities to reproduce the intensity versus j distribution, and find that they can only account for about half of the j i column density variation observed in our sources. masses are derived from the intensity vs. j distribution and are consistent with the values determined from individual sources.
we present a large sample of more than 50 galaxies in the cluster cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 based on spectroscopy and surface photometry from the hst wfpc2 and f606w / f814w, including 53 e, e / s0, and s0 galaxies. we have also expanded the sample by including 53 cluster members with spectroscopic redshifts from the literature. the early - type galaxies follow a different fundamental plane relation from the ellipticals, in contrast to the s0s, which follow a relation of elliptical galaxies. the intrinsic scatter in the ratio of the elliptical to s0 intrinsic scatter is large, nearly 3-@xmath1, which is consistent with the scatter seen in the color - magnitude relation. we show that the scatter is caused by a correlation of the mean luminosity - weighted ages of the stellar populations on the fundamental plane with velocity dispersion. in particular, the strong absorption features in the blue band spectra of the e+a galaxies indicate that star - formation has been a continuous process for these galaxies since they were born, while the lack of strong emission lines indicate that most of their stellar populations have formed at an early time in their evolution. the residuals from the correlation between fundamental plane and color and fp residuals are then used to constrain the imf. we find that ( 1 ) the formation mass scales of late - type spirals are comparable to the length scale of the original sample, and ( 2 ) the scale length does not evolve with redshift to the present - day stellar populations. we conclude that the progenitors of early - types were all formed through a succession of intermediate redshift processes, leading to the formation of blue compact clusters like coma, ( 3 ) mass scales are similar to that of the cluster, ( 4 ) had star - forming histories longer than typical spiral galaxies, ( 5 ) had velocity dispersions similar to those of the local field spirals, ( 6 ) had chemical abundances consistent with what is seen in nearby clusters, ( 7 ) had comparable sizes and metallicities, ( 8 ) had no obvious dependence on morphological type, ( large spiral to irregular morphologies ), ( 9 ) had masses and radial velocities which are consistent with low - mass, low - metallicity, type - ii galaxies. in effect, we have identified three clusters for which the faint end - to - end ratios of high - redshift galaxies are lower than what is
in the last few years a lot of work has been devoted to the theory of ten dimensional branes and the attempts have been made to understand the transformations that produce them. for example, in @xmath0 the weyl group has been extensively studied, but for other gauge groups it is still not clear to what extent such a formalism can be applied. in this paper we propose a generalization of the toda - system which allows to three - dimensional brane diagrams, in particular to the world - volume gauge theory. we argue that it is possible to construct these diagrams with g@xmath1-branes but it is not possible to do it in the ten dimensional limit. as a result we suggest a direction in which the branes do not correspond to branes but to compact surfaces. this direction is compatible with the atiyah - hitchin background theory and can be realized as an orientifold plane in m - theory. address = department of physics, brookhaven national laboratory, upton, ny 11973, usa, altaddress = universit degli studi di milano - bicocca, dipartimento di fisica, piazza delle scienze 3, i-20126 milano, italy address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via e. bianchi 46, i23807 merate ( lc ), switzerland address = laboratoire dastrophysique de marseille, universit paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex 13, france address = max - planck - institut fr theoretische physik, werner - heisenberg - universitt, d-85748 garching, germany address = centre de recherche physik vale de la cte dazur, ecole normale suprieure, cnrs, 24 rue lhomond, paris 7, i749, f75251 paris, frances address = departamento de fsica, universidad de so paulo c.p.- l.s., avda. universidad nacional autonoma de madrid, 28049 madrid spain, spain address = center for theoretical physics, university of delaware, newark, nnewark, de 19716 usa address = dept.
we study the time evolution of twisted magnetic field lines that thread a differentially rotating, force - free disk and interact with it via magnetohydrodynamic ` ` jets '', in order to understand the disk diffusivity during disk accretion onto magnetic stars. our analysis is based on solutions of the grad - shafranov equation for systems with rotation laws that approximate a keplerian disk. on the assumption that both the star and the magnetosphere can be approximated as being perfectly conducting, the behavior of the twisted field lines depends on the magnitude of the surface conductivity @xmath0 of the disk. in particular, it is shown that a steady - state configuration can be established only if the field expands to such a degree that it becomes effectively open. weakly ionized protostellar disks as well as disks characterized by a turbulent diffusion of magnetic flux do not satisfy this condition except very close to the corotation radius, implying that the field lines undergo secular inflation and will open up when a critical twist angle ( which is specified for an initially dipolar field configuration ) is reached. in contrast, strongly expanding field lines above the disk will not open until they approach the stellar surface, at which point the field already has a large density at the disk surface. even near that point, however, the density in the apex region of the elongated flux ropes drops precipitously, with some of the depleted mass being pushed toward the rotation axis. we explicitly demonstrate that the radial diffusion of flux across the disk is much slower than the field - line expansion in an overlying magnetosphere, providing a strong argument against the suggestion made by goodson et al. ( 1999 ) that the twisting process will truncate the disk in this configuration. we also investigate ( [ ] ) the radial _ migration _ of the field _ throughout the disk, which we argue will be important in determining the spin evolution of the magnetically active neutron star, although the available observations are not large enough to distinguish between the possible causes of the radial migration and the disk truncation.
we present wide - field photometry and spectroscopic redshifts for 48 lyman - break galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0. these objects were selected using photometric criteria designed to minimize the contamination of spectroscopically - confirmed objects by interlopers and to maximize the completeness of the photometric sample. eight hundred square arc minute point - source positions are available in the hubble deep field for these galaxies, and eight hundred blue band photometry is available from the palomar echelle spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope_. after accounting for both source and photometric errors, we find that the effective redshift selection function imposed by a particular set of photometric selection criteria is very efficient, and that the median redshift of our sample is 0.31. the median rest - frame far - uv luminosity density of our lbg sample is 1.1@xmath10.7 times lower than that of the bright lbgs in the hdf at the same redshift interval, and 0.6 times the value estimated from the ground - based data. the luminosity function for the faintest lbgs is in very good agreement with the distribution obtained from spectroscopy. there is no evidence for a significant change in the shape of the luminosities or in the number ratios of galaxies forming stars compared to the bright end in our sample. we estimate integrated luminosity densities that are a factor of 1.5 - 2.5 smaller than those derived from uv - selected star - forming regions near the median, but which are consistent with the high - redshift estimates given by madau _ et al. _ for the volume - averaged star - formation rate in typical luminous galaxies. the new lbg luminosity functions presented here are the best fitted by simple models of the spectral - energy distributions and lyman continuum opacities of galaxies on the basis of their observed colors, and, in the context of these models, by a power - law cosmology in which dust is assumed to have been substantially extinguished by dust. correcting the observed color dispersion for dust in the samples of these objects allows both the mean and the standard deviation of the intrinsic star formation rates to be determined accurately. using this intrinsic reduction in star formation rate, and allowing for this effect, we show that the co - moving number of galaxies per unit comoving volume is expected to be approximately 1.6 ( 1/3 of a hubble time scale ) for galaxies at @
we observed the optical luminescence of a semiconductor microsphere fabricated via laser ablation in superfluid helium. the microspheres show a complex structure with bubble - like voids that are located on the surface ranging in size from a few tens of nanometers to sub - microns. the transverse electric ( te ) wgm resonance wavelength is found to be continuous with a size of @xmath0 fabricated via the same method. based on the analysis of the light - matter interaction, we show that the fabry - prot interference cross section is dominated by the voids and that voids can have a significant effect on the wgm resonances. we clearly observe a large void at the core and a small one right next to it. the position of the void seems to contradict the observations that the te wgm mode resonances are strongly suppressed at the surface, which is thought to be due to the filling of the inner void. furthermore, we demonstrate that the void - free wgm lasing with continuous - wave laser excitation has high lasing quantum yield, which contradicts the findings of the experimentally observed voids. we propose that there are some hidden parameters that govern the size and location of the cavities. the study of the fabrication process helps us to understand the origin of the different quality factors of the whispering gallery modes. 99 m. aspelmeyer, t. j. kippenberg, and f. marquardt, eds., _ photonics _ ( academic press, 2003 ). k.m. zno is a band - gap semiconductor with a large band gap and high-@xmath1 zno target. it is known to be a good optical microcavity. when a small section of the target surface is ablated by a laser beam, an ionized solid - state plasma forms. during the ablation process, the ionized plasma cools rapidly and a cloud of ionized gas condensates forms within the cavity. the cloud gradually increases in brightness and reaches the level of the optical mode lasing. the optical - radiation intensity is proportional to the laser intensity, and this corresponds to the optical quantum yield. we believe that this cloud will play an important role during the phase transition and may play a role in the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ). 2
we optimize the far - field emission profiles of planar photonic crystal ( phc ) microcavities while maintaining a high quantum efficiency. we demonstrate the h1 phc defect, being a point - like defect on a triangular lattice, as a candidate for polarization degenerate light emission because of its orthogonally - polarized, spectrally - degenerate dipole modes. by optimizing the cavity structure, we are able to dramatically improve the coupling efficiency to the modes. the maximum mode matching of this device to a single - mode fiber is 92@xmath0. our results demonstrate that this platform is well - suited for realizing quantum information protocols in the solid state. 10 l. mandel and e. wolf, _ quantum electronics _ ( cambridge university press, 1995 ). p. g. kwiat, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, and a. v. sergienko, ` ` single - photon source based on excitonic quantum dots, '' phys. rev. lett. * 104 *, 251102 ( 2010 ). e. waks, e. diamanti, b. c. sanders, c. d. soukoulis, and o. glionis, _ optical quantum information with photonic crystals _ ( springer science & business media, 1999 ). c. santori, f. guberde, t. monz, n. t. hill, r. urbansky, j. w. nicholson, and m. j. holland, '' nature * 415 *, 394440 ( 2004 ). a. e. smith, m. s. robinson, and w. r. goodman, _ linear optics in compact optics _ ( taylor & francis, 2006 ). d. bouwmeester, j.- p. wolf, and t. m. kippenberg,``advances in quantum nanomagnets and quantum dots ( invited ), '' physical review letters * 83 *, 27412 ( 2009 ). s. tanzilli, w. tittel, and h. zbinden, _ solid - state quantum - state system : a review, _ einstein - podolsky - rosen theory _ ( wiley - interscience, 2000 ). g. takahashi, y. kajiya, s. takeuchi, and v. shimokawa

the maximum likelihood estimation problem for a lvy process is posed by maximizing the akaike information criterion ( aic ) in a functional space of log - likelihood objective fokker - planck equations, together with a constrained partial integral differential equation ( pide ) in the same functional space. we show that these two pides can be understood in terms of a bi - directional gamma process, which is not inside one of the parametrizations of the kolmogorov forward equation, but can be approximated by those. the analysis problem for the lvy distribution at time @xmath0 is shown to be solved in the framework of maximum likelihood objective functional by using the chang - cooper and imex methods and a non parametric approximation of the measure based on the dynamic programming principle. we prove that the analysis is stable and reliable. as a final test, we consider daily price - returns of german stock exchange dax over a period of almost 1000 trading days and show that the fits to the stochastic differential equation can be very good, even better than those obtained by minimizing the aic. this shows that our approach to the estimation problem can be of interest for the solution of the model calibration problem as well as for the optimization problem with pide constraints. model calibration is a subject that has been studied for a long time, see e.g. @xcite. here we take a step by step approach towards the derivation of a hierarchy of estimation problems that approximate the original one. our goal is to find a suitable description of this sample with an exponential lvy market model. in the present article, we demonstrate the practicality of our numerical approach by approximating the non - parametric distribution of lvy densities, by using three different approximations : ( i ) approximation of the original lvy density distribution based on a first order optimality condition, ( ii ) modeling of the second order spline density distribution and ( iii ) estimation of the most probable lvy model from the time lvy data.
we explore statistical relations between two populations of high-@xmath0 galaxies and their hosting dark matter halos : ( i ) lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are isolated in a color color diagram due to their uv continuum depression, whereas lyman @xmath1 emitters ( laes ) are more strongly clustered. the major purpose of our current analysis is twofold ; the first is to clarify the difference of hosting halos for lbgs and laes. we find that the two lbg samples can be well described by the halo model with an appropriate hof in an approximate fashion. joint distribution of number density and angular clustering among lbgs, laes, and laez5s is difficult to reconcile with current models of halo occupation function and clustering on large scales. there is a weak indication that laes host more luminous galaxies that lbgs do not. on the other hand, this issue is discussed in the context of the cold dark matter. if true, this would suggest that the star formation efficiency per unit dark matter mass increases with time. the number density of laes is always higher than that of lbgs. laes reside in a larger redshift region and have a lower clustering amplitude than lbgs located in a redshift zero. while lbgs are strictly isolated, there is an approximate one - to - one correspondence between halos and lbgs provided the minimum mass of halos which host the population of galaxies is large. the similarity of the luminosity - overdensity relation for laes versus lbgs suggests that no special mechanism is needed for the formation of these galaxies. if it is indeed the case that small halos host galaxies, this implies that the mechanism does not depend on the mass of the host dark matter halo. * key words : * cosmology : theory galaxies : formation galaxies : halos
we have investigated the relationship between galaxy cluster mass ( @xmath0 ) and three mass proxies ( gas temperature, gas mass, and quasi - integrated pressure ), using _ xmm - newton _ and subaru / hyper - suprime - cam data. we find that the temperature and gas mass deviations are positively correlated ; this result is independent of the range of gas physics ( gravity only, preheating ) implemented in the simulations. the intrinsic scatter in all mass - observable scaling relations is about a factor of three. our results provide the basis for a new calibration method, based on principal component analysis, for constructing and calibrating a low - scatter mass proxy using solely observational data ( e.g., weak lensing, x - ray, sz and optical observables ). we also discuss the correlation between gas mass and temperature deviations. our interpretation of the results is complicated by the inclusion / exclusion of one cluster, namely a1914, known to be a well known merging cluster. if this cluster is excluded from our analysis then the covariance of intrinsic scatter is reduced most notably. in general, deviations from the mean relation are not significantly correlated with the mean cluster temperature ; instead, the temperature deviations appear to be prevalent at redshifts where merging clusters are most prevalent. we conclude that a larger sample of clusters is required to robustly measure how the most extreme merging clusters influence the scaling relations.

we present the results of a comprehensive environmental study of galaxies in the local universe, based on a large sample of galaxies from the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ). this data set consists of galaxies inhabiting the entire range of galactic environments, from the sparsest field to the densest clusters, and allows us to study environmental variations without combing multiple data sets with inhomogeneous characteristics. furthermore, we can extend our research from the traditional cluster / field comparison to more ` ` general '' environmental studies for the first time. in order to minimize the effects of hubble type on star formation, we have used an automatically measured concentration index as a star formation baseline. unfortunately, however easily one may enumerate processes to drive galaxy evolution, and however plausible such mechanisms may be, there exists little evidence demonstrating that any one of these processes act over an extended period of time, while observations of any population of galaxies give one only a snapshot of one instant in the history of galaxies. also, observations at intermediate and high redshifts are difficult to provide the detailed information which is needed to elucidate subtle and complicated processes. however, any means by which galaxies interact with their surroundings should operate today as well as at earlier times, and, therefore, observations of the nearby populations should be an effective way of understanding them. in addition to direct evidence for the occurrence of interactions capable of driving galaxy evolution,the local universe holds clues about the nature of those phenomena in the form of variations of galaxy properties with environment, which must be the result of past interactions. among cluster galaxies, poor clusters show higher levels of star formation than even the field. this is particularly evident at the highest star formation rates where the hsem galaxies are almost 4 times more abundant in poor clusters than in any other population. among field populations, rich clusters show lower levels of ` ` normal '' star formation '', and many poorer clusters show enhanced levels of both. the percentiles for the field galaxies are significantly different at significance level @xmath0 ( 2@xmath1 galaxies in each subset ). all of these trends are observed both inside and outside of clusters, implying that physical processes responsible for the correlation might not be intrinsic to cluster environments. we find that star formation rate of a given ` ` galactic structure '' is sensitive to local galaxy density and shows a continuous correlation with the local density.
we have obtained high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of 30 quasars using the keck 10-meter telescope and reobserved 30 objects from the survey of steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) down to a 3.5 @xmath0 detection limit. we found that the overall continuum shapes within a wavelength range of 3100 - 7000 were remarkably similar in all pairs and that, in general, the emission lines were in general very similar. however, the two spectra show significant differences in the relative strengths and relative velocity shifts of qsos with separations of a few tens of kpc. we conclude that the differences are most likely due to an intrinsic variation in the centroid velocities of the broad emission lines, which can be accommodated as a result of gravitational lensing of a qso by a massive background galaxy or a cluster of galaxies. an analysis of the spectral differences between the two observations [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] shows that the [ 3 ] complex is noticeably stronger in the first epoch spectrum, while [ 4 ] has a weaker profile due to its blue wing. moreover, the [ 5 ] emission line is conspicuously wider in both spectra, both only except near the dichroic changeover. these discrepancies could be caused by a systematic difference in the time scales of the ionization components associated with the quasar emission lines. a visual inspection of the spectra reveals no significant cross - over in the line - of - sight velocity to either pair of emission lines in the spectrum of q2345 + 007a, b ( separation 3.77 ) or q1634 + 267a, abell ( separation 6.3 ). there is an indirect argument for believing that the two pairs have the same redshifts within the errors of measurement and, therefore, they may be considered to be a binary qso. the lack of change in the emission line velocity in each pair supports this interpretation. a gravitational lens candidate has not been confirmed with certainty in any case, despite the fact that such a lens has not yet been established with certainty.
we study the elasticity of strips swelled with an inhomogeneous pattern of swelling. for strips of closed geodesics, we show that the prescribed gaussian curvature only guarantees a prescribed bending energy. for conical strips, we find that the bending energy is minimized if a ` ` resonance '' condition is satisfied. we combine our results with numerical simulations to determine the actual bending energy at the center of the closed strips. in the experiment, we were able to reproduce the closed strip center line and obtain a good agreement with the analytical results. our results suggest how to reduce the energy of a wide class of non - euclidean strips. = 1 there is a rich history to the studies of sheets of elasticity @xcite. in particular, periodic changes in the sheet thickness can result in interesting geometric patterns, such as the crossing of two planes on a piece of the sheet. in recent years, there has been great progress in understanding the non - equilibrium physics of these periodic changes, which give rise to new interesting applications such as device - specific ` ` homogenization '' @xcitp@xcite and ` ` raman ho@xmath0''#1. in this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining a _ prescribed _ metric for an elastic strip. the usual expression for a prescribed metric is given by @xmath1, which is a positive real constant for strips in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions. we will review this general expression for generic sheets, and also note some examples where the prescribed metric vanishes. however, we will not address this question in the present paper, instead we will address it via a simple model, which we refer to as the _ conical strip ansatz_. this model has a simple form when the first two lines of the paper are depicted. for the class of strips described in section [ s : openstrips ], which are closed, axisymmetric and non - degenerate, we identify three classes of closed strips for which the mean curvature is _ not _ a good approximation to the metric. these strips have the property that their unit normals are aligned along a cone point. using this relation, we determine the lowest order in the strain at one of these resonances, and this generalizes the well - known strain - induced energy of deformations. in addition, we investigate the existence of a minimal energy strip when there are no closed strips along the center line, and find that this can also be inferred from our simulations. in fact, we

the vela supernova remnant appears to be associated with the vela pulsar psr b0833 - 45, the prototype of synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering, with @xmath0-ray emission detected from the nebula in radio, optical, and x - rays. ground- and space - based observations show that the x - ray and optical jets are aligned along the well - defined axis of cylindrical symmetry around the pulsar, which is oriented approximately with respect to the plane of the sky. this implies that the magnetic field strength and total energy of the electrons are in the balance of energy transfer as well as photon pressure conservation. a bright, elongated optical jet is also associated with this high latitude structure, and the possibility of its violent interaction with a molecular cloud in the innermost parts of the snr wind is discussed. if correct, this would be the first detection of magnetic field strengths at energies above 100 gev in such a remnant. we also discuss the multiwavelength properties of the system, and it is noted that the flux in the tev gamma - ray band is probably being powered by synchrotrons, with the highest energy electron emission ( up to at least 50 mev ) presumably being due to inverse comptel scattering of the high energy electrons. egret observations of the crab pulsar allow a determination of the spectral shape of the emission site, and are consistent with the whipple tev upper bounds. a complex magnetic field structure is inferred in the optical / radio, and possibly in the near infrared, and is suggested by some observations to be responsible for the optical ` ` wisps ''. we discuss the role of a bipolar torus - like structure in the electromagnetic field of the remnant, and conclude that it may be a viable candidate for the plasmonic component of the observed gamma radiation. for supernova remnants such as the crab and sn1006, extended emission from the mid - infrared is suppressed below tev, due to the poynting of cosmic rays to electrons in the ism. this may have an important effect on the production of gamma - rays above tev.
the formation and growth of a quark matter droplet in a neutron star core is studied using a relativistic bag - model for the dynamics of deconfined hadronic matter and a quantum tunneling nucleation theory for the onset of dynamical deconfinement in the hadronic phase of the star. the distribution of quarks in the droplet is evaluated taking into account the effects of the electromagnetic field, the radiative corrections, special relativity, energy dissipation, and dynamical compressibility. the effective mass of a virtual droplet moving under a potential barrier is found to be sufficiently small to keep its overpressure fairly small compared with the fermi velocity averaged over nucleon species. this provides an eminent property of the quantum - tunneling formation of a real droplet : the nucleation is controlled by the dissipative processes in which the nucleon quasiparticles moving ballistically collide with the droplets surface, rather than by the reversible underbarrier motion of a coherent state. in addition, we find that the presence of hyperons changes the equation of state and the composition before and after the first - order phase transition, thereby affecting the dynamical properties of the quark - hadron phase transition in a way that is not possible with only the well - known landau - lifshitz - kagan mechanism. the time, thus required for the formation and overpressure evolution in the star, is calculated in the overpressure regime ; the critical overpressure needed to prevent a coulomb potential barrier from forming is roughly @xmath0 s. we also find that inside a droplet of relatively small radius, an appreciable electric charge arises from the pressure equilibrium between quarks and nucleons inside a roughly uniform sea of electrons and muons. with increase in the nucleplet radius, the degenerate gas of muons becomes more and more effective at screening the forming droplet charge, and at last prevents the coulomomb potential barriers from forming. the resulting _ critical _ overpressure and _ temperature _ of the transition from the stable to the metastable phase of hyperonic matter are also estimated. it is found that at about the critical pressure, the density discontinuity between the stable and metastable phases induces a hydrodynamic mass flow in the medium around the formed droplet. the flow causes the surface tension between the initially hadronic and quark phases and thus enhances the entropic part of the energy barrier between the initial metastable ( quark ) phase and the initial stable phase.
we have used the flair - ii system on the u.k. schmidt telescope to obtain new, complete galaxy samples over an area of more than 183 deg@xmath0 in the central region of the shapley supercluster. the galaxy samples, defined in the @xmath1band, are dominated by bright galaxies which provide a more detailed view of the galaxy distribution than previous studies. in addition to bright galaxies, we have identified two previously unknown sheets of galaxies which seem to connect various abell clusters in the supercuruster. these sheets alone represent an overdensity of galaxies compared to a uniform galaxy distribution. within the initial survey area of our group the new galaxies contribute an additional 50 % to the known contents of the supercuster. we furthermore derive a substantial, as measured for the first time, radial velocity of the local group which may contribute to its peculiar velocity. for the region targeted by our group we find a mean local group velocity of v.a.= 15000and a best fit power - law mass - to - radius ratio ofus(v=200 ) = 9.0. we conclude that the additional mass found represents a significant, and perhaps dominant, contribution to the mass and force required to explain the cmb dipole anisotropy.

we study the variation of the zinc metallicity ( zm ) relation, in simulated galaxy clusters and groups, for the mass - dependent redshift range @xmath0=1.3, in order to assess the contribution of star formation efficiency in shaping its amplitude and scatter. we consider two different galaxy samples : the _ dead sequence _ sample, which consists of all and only those galaxies having star formation rate ( sfr ) below a threshold value defined as slowly progressive with redshift : and the _ open box _ sample of late - type galaxies, which consist of both groups and clusters. for both samples we analyze the slope and scatter of the zm relation, confirm that it is dominated by massive galaxies at all epochs, and show that its shape is a function of redshift. regarding the cluster cores, we find that the evolution of the slope is well described by the super - wind " scheme, that has proven to successfully reproduce many chemical and thermal properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ). likewise, the iron mass ratio in models with simple sfr is strongly skewed towards a five times higher metal content locked up into stars than in the outer gas. at the same time an anti - correlation between ssfr and stellar mass is established, suggesting that in galaxy clusters the ssfr is a crucial parameter for defining a consistent population of rs members to be compared with observations at different redshifts. the gaseous oxygen abundance is very scarce in our simulations, implying that whatever _ closed box _ of galaxies is needed also includes the outflows, responsible for the asymmetric star - burst driven galactic outflow. we find however that the outflow contribution to the gas metal enrichment is small, and in most environments the metal - enrichment process is efficiency - dependent.

we present a phylogenetic reconstruction of the entire tree of life from the leaves of a single plant to the tip, in terms of @xmath0 individual branching events. we discuss the many properties of this huge data set and demonstrate how it allows us to better understand the evolutionary history of the universe. particular attention is paid to the internal relationships among species, the ones more traditionally represented in a tree topology. we use the degree distribution to construct a large scale structure and we address the genetic relationships among the individuals composing this tree. we address issues such as the scale - free type of the distribution of the evolutionary relationships and the importance of the links among existing splits of evolutionary data sets. as a by - product, we obtained a new phylogenetic tree of the mediterranean sea which is a weighted minimum spanning tree, i.e., a complete graph where the distances of the branches are logarithmically proportional to the total length of the nodes, in such a way that links all the individuals together in a shortest path across the network. the distances are computed using a distance matrix which assigns a weight to each branch. the probability of finding a node with the same total length and similar shape as its measured by the pairs of sampled shots and the corresponding distance matrix can be constructed from the distance matrix. we characterize this network by its degree distribution and show that it is parameterized by a very broad class of networks. in particular, we find that the proportion of nodes with high enough distances to jump to the region of the maximal possible genetic distance as a function of the distance among the pairs, scales as a power law, with exponent of -1.95. we confirm that this extensive network of genetic ties is a result of the sexual reproduction and clonal clonal reproduction, thus confirming the previous findings based on the morphology from taxonomic diversity analyses. the present analysis is just a first qualitative approach to what is needed to characterize the internal genetic relationships in complex networks, and to understand their origin.
we investigate the connection between luminous x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and globular clusters ( gcs ) in a sample of early - type galaxies. our sample includes four galaxies, all of which have been observed with _ chandra _, and another three galaxies with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). we find a correlation between the probability of a gc hosting an lmxb and its optical luminosity ; this correlation appears to result primarily from the larger number of stars in optically luminous gcs. at luminosities @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 ( 0.310 kev ), optically bright gcs are much more likely to contain lxbs than faint gcs, but the distribution is consistent with a constant probability per unit optical luminous. the probability that a gic has a lmxxb per unit luminosity of the gc also appears to be constant from galaxy to galaxy, with a value of about @xfig2 lmxb per @xmb0 on the full sample. to within the errors, all galaxies are consistent with this value. we give some observational evidence that supports the conclusions of our study. the fraction of gcs which contain luminous sources of x - rays at the luminosity level of our complete sample rises to about 3.3 % at the highest luminosity levels studied here. this fraction seems to increase to about 4 % at lower luminososities, where the galaxies are more s0 - like and spiral - like. we provide some empirical evidence that these trends are likely to be due to stellar dynamical interactions between gcs and ambient stars. the relation between gc luminosity and star density seems to be consistent with models which predict that stars in gcs would evolve into binaries over time. we interpret this result as evidence for an increase in the frequency of lmbs along the hubble sequence from spiral bulges to compact dwarfs. galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : fundamental parameters
the darklight detector is a proposed heavy photon search experiment using a compact, magnetic spectrometer designed to search for decays to lepton pairs of heavy photon ( @xmath0 ) candidates. a beam test in summer 2012 verified that sustained, high - power transmission of the fel electron beam through millimeter apertures is feasible. the design review summarizes the current status of the experiment and looks ahead to a possible commissioning in 2015. darklight was proposed to address two major goals : _ e.g. _, _ dark light will be installed on the uv beamline at the jlab fel at location a1. this provides a beam power of up to 1 mw ( 10 ma current ). using the dense hydrogen target described above, it will provide 1 ab@xmath1 of integrated luminosity per month of operation. the goal is to commission the detector in 2015 with data - taking in 2016. _, _ tev gamma - ray bursts and non - thermal, ultra - relativistic electron beams will be sent through a windowless, dense hydrogen gas target located in a 0.5 t solenoidal magnetic field. outside the beampipe there is a lepton tracker covering a focal plane. a lead scintillator sandwich for photon detection surrounds the tracker. the experimental reach for the invisible search for various photon detection efficiencies will be extended through adding photon detection capability. details regarding the experimental design and read - out setup, optimal setup and energy loss calculations are in progress. = 10000 t. affolder, h. akimoto, a. akopian, m. g. albrow, p. amaral,7 s. r. amendolia, d. amidei, k. anikeev, j. antos,1 g. apollinari, t. arisawa, w. ashmanskas,7 m. atac,7 p. azzi - bacchetta, n. bailey, s. baroiant,5 m. barone, g. bachacou, r. badgett, l. betev, a.- c. blanc, v. boisvert,6 p. bertolucci, b. c. choudhary, x. jin, e. barbera, w.- b. bhatia, j.- s. choi, b.- y. choe, x.- w. dai,
we investigate the phase - space of the b / p bulge and x - shaped structures in a model of edge - on disc galaxies with a rotating magneto - rotational instability of galactic type. in the general case the family of periodic orbits, p.o., which are the main families in the region of the radial and vertical internal reflection resonances ( ilrs ), is investigated. for this purpose we have used the colour - rotation technique of @xcite. in this way we have associated typical structures in the 4d space with the neighbourhood of stable, as well a with simple, double and complex unstable periodic orbits. the quasi - periodic orbits trapped by the bar x1 have been studied by examining their contribution to the formation of a peanut - shaped side - on profile. we find that their presence has a significant effect on the resulting unsharp - masked profiles of the galaxy. before the introduction of the x1v1 family in the system, which is responsible for the main features of the observed morphology of the bulge, most of the orbits studied belong to the standard 3d periodic orbit family. moreover they are the only periodic orbits with the same deviation from the initial conditions of x1. the main feature of the perturbed orbits is the presence of a clear ` ` @xmath0 '' -type feature, which has taken the shape of a tube or ` ` x''-bar. the emergence of this feature is due to the dynamical instabilities of the bar and bulge components, caused by the same mechanism that causes the development of the boxy - peanut structure in the 3d case. we have found a literature of ` ` ` sticky '' orbits that could also reinforce the x features. among them are ones that are stable in the interval of the energy interval in which x1 is simple unstable, that could be used as ` ` building blocks '' of the peanut. our results indicate that stable periodic orbits could have a significant role in the building of the central bulge component, since they are more easily trapped in 3d unstable potentials.

we present new results based on near - ir spatially resolved spectral observations of jupiter obtained with the cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( vims ). vims was launched in early 2000 to search for an upper ammonia cloud layer beginning at 700-mb and a putative nh@xmath0sh cloud top. the wide field of view covered by the observation ( roughly a quarter of the jovian disk ) was found to be optically thick outside the hot spot regions, but the wavelength dependence of the neutral hydrogen column density was very sparse, consistent with observations by the groundbased instruments. a 3-absorption feature was clearly detected in one region of the spectrum, where an average opacity factor of @xmath13 was derived from model spectra at wavelengths 1.1 - 2.1. comparison of vims spectra with groundbased spectra, selected nicmos observations, and iso spectra indicates that the vims absolute calibration is relatively consistent with other observations, but that vims measurements have two significant artifacts, one in the 1.60 - 1.68 region where a huge responsivity correction for particles smaller than 350 mb turned out to be insufficiently accurate, and another in the 2.97-spectral feature which appears to require a contribution from ammonia ice particles. we were able to fit a low - opacity vims spectrum quite well using ice as the sole absorber, but were not able to match other models based on much cloudier regions, the main defect being an absorption feature near 2 in the spectra that was much larger than observed. models with as the only absorber did not provide nearly as good a fit to the high - opacity spectrum as models with both and absorbers present in jupiter s clouds, but provided better fits when both were present in the same physical location. the best fits were obtained with,, an absorber with absolute calibration of 0.38.05 or 0.23, and 0.35, a solid angle to the sky that provided the best fit to all spectra. a -coated particles above a layer of much larger ( r@xcmath11.3 ) particles above revealed by only and provide the best fitting to low - optical depth ( i.e., optical depth at 2 - 0.1 ) particles. the maximum optical depth of the thin cloud layer ( modeled as physically thin but with scattering ranging from 330 to 550 mb ) was insignificant over most of the range from 1.05 to 0.41
the schwarzschild black hole ( ss bh ) is a paradigmatic model of quantum gravity, yet there are problems with the long - time evolution of bhs. the main idea is that quantum backreaction effects prevent a continuous family of models labelled by one or more deformation parameters. if an attractor solution exists, the evolution does not coincide with the transition of the original model to a specific remnant geometry, namely the attractor. provided the notion of light - like infinity ( @xmath1 ) makes sense, the proposed remnant geometry is flat ( i.e. constant temperature and density ). in language of dynamical systems first of all, the semi - classical derivation of the hawking flux in the context of@xmath0 dilaton gravity is done through a specific form of planck scale contributions, dilaton evaporation, consequences for the information paradox and cosmological implications ; neither is the baby universe, at least not in an obvious way. the present work tries to circumvent these difficulties, with the modification of the definition of the dilaton line - element, taking the aim of being as transparent as possible in describing the physical aspects of a bh. in contrast to the reissner - nordstrm scenario ( where information is released during the final stages ) there remains the possibility that some of the information is retained in the remnant and it emerges at the end of theevaporation process. when the possibility of storing any information beyond the standard model is taken into account, it turns out that there are two ` ` natural '' solutions both related to the initial conditions and to the remnant geometry. the first ones are sufficient to explain the main features of the observed evolution of ss bhs, but they predict too large amounts of energy loss ( e.g. the expansion of the universe ) in the final stage. the second one is consistent with the presence of a cosmic string, but this result is not supported by the available experimental data.
the kondo model was seminal to quantum chromodynamics in the large @xmath0 limit. it describes the interaction of a magnetic impurity with fermionic quasi - particles of a landau fermi liquid in the form of a kondo cloud, which screens the impurity from the external medium. the original kondo problem was solved, but many questions about the original model remain unresolved, such as the dependence of the entanglement entropy on the size of the sub - system. in this paper, we study the holographic model of the kondo effect in this limit using the ryu - takayanagi ( rt ) approach. this is a non - abelian gauge theory in the ads@xmath1-theorem. we present numerical results for the backreaction of the brane matter fields on the geometry, and discuss the implications of several of the results that we present. in the numerical calculations, we identify the origin of the defect on the surrounding geometries, and demonstrate how the defect may be described by a geometrically - coincident intersection of the intersecting brane and the geometric hypersurface, via the israel junction conditions of the gate equations. this leads to a numerical solution of the equations of motion, and we compare the numerical results with the field theory result previously obtained in @xcite. we find that this solves the problem with the rt hilbert transform. the space - time structure in our model is significantly changed in the sense : instead of the free electron gas in the ultraviolet ( uv ), there is an inherently strongly coupled ( luttinger liquid ( lorentz - violating ) system. this strongly coupled system is characterised by a condensate of condensates with a dimension two or more higher. the lattice volume is reduced linearly to a volume with the decrease of holographic complexity. however, the volume does not increase linearly with the number of particles, and remains finite in the infrared ( ir ). moreover, near the horizon, the level of the uv brane appears to be reduced to a dynamically - generated tension form. from these numerical results, we recover the qualitative picture that was previously found within field theory, and from the comparison with conformal field theory techniques, we argue that our model represents a possible alternative to the qcd result.
we compile a sample of 115 nearby, non - seyfert galaxies spanning a wide range of star formation activities, from starburst to nearly dormant galaxies. our sample is drawn from ultraviolet observations with various satellites. we combine these observations with infrared observations and, for a subset of the galaxies, with optical spectroscopy from various sources. we examine, in particular, the 4000 spectral discontinuity and the emission equivalent width, and the ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, which is a good indicator of attenuation by dust. based on these data alone, our sample shows that the broadening of the relation for quiescent star - forming galaxies is most driven by star formation history, and that this theoretical result can be understood in the framework of a simple model for the production of starlight and its transfer through the interstellar medium ( ism ). we show that the required effective optical radius and star formation rate for each galaxy is at least a factor of two larger than the typical values for starburst galaxies, which have effective optical radii of @xmath0 twice their _ iue _ effective radius. in order to explain why star forming galaxies span the same parameter range as other galaxies, we investigate the influence of three dimensionless quantities : the far - uv flux, the uv - optical continuum ratio and the position of a galaxy in the diagram. we argue that the dominant influence of the 3d parameters on the inferred parameters is the presence of dust in the ism and the relative strength of the 4000 discontinuity. to account for this effect, we assume that star formation has happened in a population of stars with characteristic ages ( i.e., a ` young'population ) between 5 and 15 gyr ago, and with average ages of 400 gyr. if we require star formation rates to be estimated from either flux or morphology, the most plausible explanation is that galaxies have different levels of dust attenuation, or that dust and starbursts have different ages.

we study the chaotic behavior of orbits trapped in the bound gravitational zones between the massive relativistic core and its external massive shell. we investigate in particular the role played by a _ discrete _ reflection symmetry, namely the reflection symmetry around the equatorial plane, in protecting orbits against chaoticity. specifically, we compare axially symmetric core - shell models, on their own as well as in connection with the corresponding linearized and newtonian models taken as limiting cases, to understand how the chaoticity of the orbits is affected by a reflection symmetry breaking. we find that, in analogy with the prolate quasars which we have studied in the framework of our previous work, the symmetries not only restore the regularity of orbits around a primary stable black hole but also play a non - trivial role in confining their chaotic behavior. in particular, the @xmath0-points at the equilibrium between the core and the shell are treated in a self - contained manner and their presence is shown to be an obstruction to the application of the regge - wheeler ( rw ) formalism in the description of space - time fluctuations. we also show that an approximation as a static system is able to be valid at some useful time scale, via a systematic multipolar legendre expansion. finally, we present the results of numerical calculations to support the conclusions reached in the first part of this article concerning the existence and the implications of the above - mentioned reflection symmetry. = -0.75 cm = -1.5 cm = 23.2truecm = 16.7truecm [ firstpage ] galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : oscillations methods : numerical galaxies : structure gravitation
the possibility to use hadronic perturbative qcd structure functions as ` ` tracers '' of the underlying quark - hadron structure function to study low - lying nucleon resonances in the hadron spectrum is discussed. this hypothesis is supported by new large-@xmath0 parity - violating data on the structure function of the nucleon. the operator product expansion formalism is used to obtain a global fit to these data, which includes nuclear corrections, including the full set of higher - twist contributions, as well as variations of the dis kinematic cuts. the regularization parameters are fixed by the choice of cuts in the region @xmath1 and the range of jefferson lab data. results are compared to calculations using cteq6x, alekhin09 and ht corrections, which are all consistent with hadronic structure functions in the georgi - politzer formalism. in particular, we confirm that the presence of nuclear corrections limits the ranges of tmc, ht and deuteron corrections that can be considered. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 043issn 0418 - 9833 + march 2010 * on the hadronic transition from qcd to qcd * * in the nonperturbative regime * * s. fukuzawa@ntc.nasa / goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 20771, usa * * # 1 * [ cols="<,>#1 >, < ", ] _ submitted to physics letters b _ c _ the deutsches elektronen - synchrotron ( dis ) collaboration _ m. fleischhauer@nta.physikalisches institut, d-85748 possible locations for the future cherenkov telescope at tbingen, germany _ the mit kavli institute for nuclear physics, + ul. radzikowskiego 152, 31 - 342 cracow, poland _ + _ the enrico fermi institute, the university of chicago, illinois, 60126, u.s.a. _ + e - mail : f.m.feldt@mit.edu _ keywords : deep inelastic structure functions, qcd, parton correlators, hadron duality, large - twist corrections, parity violation, transverse confinement.
the search for three heavy neutral leptons ( hnl ) is motivated by the fact that the mass scale of the hnls is close to that of the standard model higgs boson. moreover, the discovery of a new scalar particle with mass @xmath0 gev, recently discovered at the lhc, has raised questions about the nature of neutrinos and dark matter. the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be explained by hnl production in weak decays of heavy mesons and a large number of charm mesons. the hnl masses can be brought into the realm of experimental sensitivity sufficient to explain both neutrino oscillations and baryogenesis. the search for such particles will use a 400gev proton beam on a fixed target and a detector with a large muon flux, similar to the one already used by the charm experiment. the experimental set - up for this proposed experiment is described. a 173.4 gev pb@xmath1 boson beam will be used, with a background source set up consisting of a short bremsstrahlung radiation source and a short - lived hnl - hnl transition. the spectrum of the produced hnl photons is not strongly constrained due to the small number statistics, and the experimental sensitivity for the selected sources is estimated. this paper describes the basic requirements for a successful search for hnl particles and outlines the characteristics of the proposed experiment. in section [ sec : sezione ] we describe the present proposal. we then discuss the main ingredients of the experiment, including the design of the detector, the operation of the belle observatory, the detector setup, the targets of the two main experiments ( a ) and ( b ), the experimental setup, ( c ) the detector design, ( d ) the experimental budget, ( e ), ( f ) pacs numbers : 12.60.fv, 14.80.ly, 12.30.pb, 13.85.+z.
we present new large - scale molecular cloud maps in the j=3 - 2 transition of @xmath0co, obtained with the heterodyne receiver array at the james clerk maxwell telescope. the large dataset allows us to assess the velocity and spatial structure of the molecular cloud in the presence of massive embedded luminous stars. we use the data to take a census of the massive outflows in the rosette molecular cloud ( rmc ). this census shows that high - velocity ( v@xmath1 ) clumps are frequently associated with bright iras objects, many of which have velocity gradients comparable to that of the co gas. compact, low - velocity clumps appear to be predominantly associated with young stars, in the sense that the velocity gradient associated with clumps with embedded young stars is slightly higher than that for clumps without embedded stars. this suggests that, as is also the case with hv maps, the outflow is dominated by shocks to the surrounding gas. the spatial distribution of the clumps is quite clumpy, with sharp - edged clouds mostly facing the ob stars. the overall clumpy structure is very similar to the simulated images from sph modelling of the effects of o - star photoionisation on a turbulent molecular cloud. we find a correlation between luminous young clusters, high velocity outflows and bright regions of molecular emission. we suggest that the extended hv gas in the nw ridge and the extended blue - shifted clumps associated with the rmc have been accelerated by the pressure of the outflows. in most of the well - defined nw clumps, the observed 3 - 2/1 - 0 ratios are higher than this, suggesting that most line emission is from near the clump surface and not from an excess of compact gas. we identify three distinct spatio - velocity structures : ( 1 ) relatively compact regions with broad line wings, identified as young stars or old stars ; ( 2 ) extensive undifferentiated regions of emission with narrow linewidths ; and ( 3 ) flat regions without any prominent hv ( or molecular gas ) outflow from the central cluster ngc2244.
we present the details of a new photo - polarimeter mounted onto the 1-m carl zeiss telescope of the indian institute of astrophysics, kavalur, for observations of several polarized and unpolarized stars. the polarimeter was designed and built in three spectral bands ( @xmath0 = 22, 22, and 22 ) using mach - zehnder optics. its working principle is based on the process of serkowski, scarrott, & piirola ( 1991 ). a large focal plane diaphragm is used to observe the star light with a beam displacement prism - based polarimeter. the incident light beam will emerge from the prism as two spatially separated beams, with mutually perpendicular planes of polarization at the focal plane superposed on the background sky. a photomultiplier tube will detect the beam separation and provide the polarizations in the two different bands. the telescope technology and electronics used for the fabrication of the polarimeters are described, and the working principle of the instrument is illustrated. we present a picture of the working of the various components. the optical design consists of achromatic material that includes a glass filter, three kinds of optical elements, and a set of glass filters. the latter filters are very transparent over a wide range of wavelengths and are suitable for optical observations in the optical regime accessible with the current technology. the design of the aperture of the prism also allows optical imaging in the visible range. in the 22 band, the mirror - deformation - corrected colours of the material ( i.e., the so - called'super - achromatism') are used as the optical elements. the polarization of the two beams is obtained by subtracting the light that is reflected off the central axis of the telescope. the resulting polarimeter has a large field of view. observations can be made in two, three, and six hours at the same time, thereby yielding a very high precision in polarimetry. some of the objects studied in the present programme are r v tauri stars, herbig ae / be stars, luminous blue variables, young stellar objects, r crb stars, and luminous red variables. observations have been made on 14 april30 may 2014, 20 april 2014, 22 june 2014, 07.30.et, 21 july 2014, 31.30.-s-, 42.50.ly
we use numerical simulations to investigate the formation of the first stars in the universe from the assembly of their dark matter halos through the end of the optically - thin regime of the collapsing protostar. the simulations are performed under three different sets of initial conditions with identical cosmological parameters and resolution, but with different initial fractions of metal - enriched gas ( pop iii style ). we find that fragmentation occurs when the metallicity is above the critical value, @xmath0, at which the gas is able to cool to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature solely through ro - vibrational lines of h@xmath1. in this case we refer to this as the ` cmb - regulated star formation mode.'in order to evaluate the validity of our model, we calculate the optical depth in the collapsing cloud for the most important high density, gas - phase metal coolants and find that it is the sum of the metals that is important, and not the abundance pattern used. nevertheless, our results are robust in spite of the fact that the chemical abundance patterns used are likely to be incorrect. fragmentation occurs only when the gas temperature does not exceed the cmb temperature, i.e., when the metal - free gas is not cool enough to prevent the cooling rate from rising above the stalling temperature. we confirm this by running a simulation with the same gas temperature and density as the other simulations. in each simulation, we find more bound clumps than in any other simulation. however, in the lowest simulation, run r3_z-2, the clumps are quite massive, and we show that fragmentation comes to a halt as the cooling time increases to be significantly above the dynamical time. this behavior is in agreement with the model of an imf that evolves with redshift for stars that are formed from a multiply - producing initial star, but not for those that remain in a high - mass initial star.
gamma - ray astronomy currently covers the energy range below a few 100 kev and up to @xmath0 tev, a domain that is poorly covered by existing instruments. in the low- and medium - energy domain, cosmic rays play a crucial role in the energetic balance of the interstellar medium and they are the primary driving agent of interstellar chemistry that ultimately produces the building blocks of life. this review discusses the status and the potential of future space - borne gamma - ray instruments for exploring this energy domain. specific instrument concepts and goals are described, focussing on future instruments ( or instrument concepts ) that are able to detect gamma rays in the 100 mev to 100 tev energy range, although some of the discussed instruments will explore the sky beyond this band. based on recent achievements, open science questions, and ongoing instrument developments, this review will discuss the impact of future instruments in this energy range on our understanding of cosmic - ray acceleration and transport in the universe. it will also highlight the key science challenges that lie ahead, including detector sensitivity, angular resolution and sensitivity in the high - energy and low - energy domains, and the need to understand the physics of particle acceleration in supershells and galactic winds. the review also highlights the main physics challenges facing forward, including : i ) search for particle acceleration sites able to drive the earth out of the black hole horizon, ii ) study of galactic supernova remnants that could act as particle accelerators, and iii ) intergalactic medium emission, and de - excitation and annihilation of cosmic rays. in particular, gamma rays will play a key accelerator for galactic supernovae remnants such as the cygnus x - ray superbubbles. as for other source classes, there still exist a few * proton accelerators capable of accelerating cosmic rays up to the ` ` ` knee '' energy, i.e. up to at least a few tens of gev. the key to all of these tasks is an improved sensitivity, an increased angular resolution, and a better understanding of the non - thermal nature of the underlying emission processes.
we study the entropic uncertainty relations ( eur ) of three - dimensional systems with complementary observables that have mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) as eigenstates. for each dimension @xmath0 we find a tight relation between the shannon entropies of the three observables, and the eur for a complete set of mubs observables. in particular, we find that the tightest eur relation, which is the only known from the qubit case, is achieved when only two observables are present in the system. as a consequence, we develop a simple computational method to obtain eurs that are tight also in the case of integer spin. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm numerical and theoretical results on the eurs of 3-dimensional quantum systems are reported in @xcite. the study of such relations is motivated by the fact that there are several cases in the literature where the physical state of the system can be written in terms of a family of qubits ( e.g. spin observables ), and it is desirable to have a system that can be prepared in an eigenstate of one of them. it is then crucial to determine eur relations that are robust both under perturbations and with respect to completeness. in this respect the theory of qubit systems has proved to be a valuable tool for describing the complex behavior of many - body systems. an example of such a system is the two - body system, for which eur was predicted by maassen and uffink s relation in the early 90 s. this relation was shown to be valid for arbitrary non - abelian gauge theories and has been verified numerically in several high - dimensions. recently it was shown that eur could be obtained in qubits as well, with the aim of studying general non - perturbative entanglement situations involving a large number of degrees of freedom. some examples are given for qubits, in particular the time evolution of the magnetic field in a spin system, and for excitations that are confined in two dimensions. for this reason, eur has received much attention, and eur with qubits has been used as a bell satz in the context of statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics and in numerical simulations of various types of out - of - equilibrium systems. however, it is not very useful in general to obtain such eur in a numerical setup. moreover, in most cases
we examine the dynamics of the susceptible - exposed - infected - removed ( seir ) epidemiological model with stochastic forcing. the original system of governing equations is high - dimensional, since nodes and links evolve in time and must be approximated as an additional set of ordinary differential equations. in the presence of noise, it is natural to consider the dynamics on a lower - dimensional space, since the deterministic system of equations can be transformed to a reduced system of evolution equations. we first present two methods of model reduction, whereby the goal is to project both the noise and the dynamics onto the low - dimensional center manifold. the first method is to use the damped center manifold transform, which consists of marginal differential equations obtained from a linear transformation coupled with appropriate parameter scaling. since the normal form of the transformed equations is nonlinear, a deterministic realization does not work well in the case of white noise, we present a second method where the noise is injected into the center manifold in the form of additive, gaussian noise. we show that this method properly captures the initial disease outbreaks and continues to accurately predict the outbreaks for time scales which are orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time. furthermore, as a result, real disease data includes only the number of infectious individuals. our method allows us to predict the correct timing of the outbreaks based on the observed number of individuals and the amplitude and phase of any recurrent behavior. we also demonstrate the power of our method by comparing solutions of the two systems. 75 c. cohen - tannoudji, _ current issues in population dynamics _, ( wiley, new york, ny, 2003 ). m. kosik, m.v. lebedev, and g. morishita, ` ` can one hear the shape of a drum?

we explore the accuracy of synthetic stellar evolution models ( sps ) by comparing their predictions to the integrated colors and surface brightness fluctuations of star clusters in the lmc and m31. a major source of disagreement is the comparison between sps models and the spectra of individual stars from the pickles, miles, and basel libraries. by comparing these stellar spectral libraries, we find similar disagreements in the @xmath0 colors and d@xmath1 strengths. these discrepancies are attributed to 1 ) the treatment of massive red sequence stars ( i.e., convective core overshooting ) and 2 ) metallicity dependent mass loss along the red giant branch ( rgb ). we demonstrate that the discrepancies between the padova isochrones and the empirical miles library are not due to differences between the spectral libraries. we also compare the colors of two classes of galaxies, consisting of old, metal rich star clusters and a population of quiescent stars spanning a range of ages and metallicities. the inability to reproduce the observed colors requires that particular aspects of stellar evolution be modelled. we propose that the basel library be used for this purpose. in this model, the main sequence turn off and the base of the rgb are coeval in time and for a fixed age. because of these characteristics, the models can be used as constraints on various other stellar evolution parameters such as tp agb, asymptotic giant branch, and post agb stars. we compare the model results to a large sample of low redshift galaxies, including the m31 globular cluster, m87, ngc 6553, and ngc 6528. the models are accurate for the most part of the parameter space constrained. however, constraints are too strong for metal rich models and for old metal poor systems. we urge caution before jumping to conclusions.
we present a comprehensive study of the starburst and agn activity within the luminous infrared galaxy iras 19115 - 2124, which we have dubbed the bird, based on its unusual morphological structure. the bird consists of two spiral galaxies, with a barred disk - like nucleus, and two disturbed disk / bulge systems. one has the regular composition of a spiral galaxy ( heart ), whereas the other ( head ) has a more disturbed nuclear region, with hints of both spiral / arm structure and a surface brightness profile intermediate to that of disks and ellipticals. the third component is kinematically identified with a pre - existing galaxy ( the head ), and has an absolute brightness of @xmath0. this last component is shown to be a potential supernova progenitor. using imaging from the _ advanced camera for surveys onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) _, deep ground - based optical spectroscopy from the newly commissioned southern african large telescope ( salt ), adaptive optics near - infrared ( nir ) imaging from vlt / naco, and mid - infrared photometry and spectro - photometry from the instruments onboard _ spitzer _, we find that the bird is in a final merger of two disks, with the more massive component being almost colliding with the less massive disk. the heart is an ulirg, while the other two components are more like normal spiral galaxies. we discuss in detail the dynamics of the merger, including the kinematics of the three components, the origin of the optical morphology, and identify blueshifted d absorption doublets from the heart and head components, and the nature of the associated outflows. by combining _ irac and mips imaging, we are able to pinpoint where the mid - ir ( 81000@xmath1 m ) flux and the non - stellar emission are originating, thereby pinpointing the location of the sources producing the majority of the total far - ir flux. we confirm that the head is associated with the most luminous starburst, and find that its optical morphology is that of a normal spiral galaxy. we investigate the line ratios, equivalent widths, and profiles of the important emission lines and find them to show characteristics of an type galaxy. from these we conclude that star formation is dominated by outflows, with outflows being responsible for the significant ir luminosity and star formation rate ( sfr ) this is likely an order of magnitude below that of the true starburst component. we estimate that the

[ cols= " < ", ] in this paper we discuss a method for constructing monoidal@xmath1 ( spin-1/2 ) algebra in connection with a tensor group, as defined in @xcite, and implement it in the representation theory of the quantum yang - baxter equation. this method is efficient since it produces high quality maps of the tensor product ; the canonical set - up is described in section [ traceweights ]. the main result of this paper is theorem 1.4 of s. k. molev, in which we determine the finer invariants of the subfactors. this yields a proof of his construction of the twist - loop representations from the hecke algebra, and is the first step in a detailed investigation of the relationship between these representations and the corresponding tensor products. an important development of the theory of fusion in the presence of twist is the use of the twisted loop method, a tool from quantum factor theory developed by a. g. verillier in the 1970 s as a semi - analytic method to calculate the bernoulli numbers of the main families of bimodules of genus greater than one. this technique was also used by j. o. stephenson in his work about the dependence of the hilbert space of riemann surfaces on a certain cohomology group. although this approach was initially developed by means of analytic arguments, we argue here that it can be applied also to construct canonical sets of periodic quasi - periodic sinquilbrium matrices, as well as to prove new symmetries for the cosmological constant for the complex projective spaces of parameters. in what follows, we will briefly outline this method, and then apply it to a particular instance for which we have explicit examples. for the sake of completeness, in this article we restrict to the case when the commutant of the orthog
the possibility of creating an intensive source of @xmath0-mesons at the novosibirsk electron - positron collider vepp-2 m for studies of cp and cpt violating decays has been discussed. the idea is to create an efficient source of 3-b mesons which can be used as a cp - violating wake effect source at the collider. as an alternative to the traditional cm - beam method the use of the cmd-2 detector will allow to study in detail the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( cpt ) violation of three pion decay modes in the final state. the possibility of measuring cp violation in the decay of three mesons has been also suggested. in this paper results are shown for the first time the cross sections of the recently developed detector gheisha ( kskl3.fig]a corresponding to the integrated luminosity of the injectable beam have been analyzed around the decay mode corresponding to about @xcite. the measurements were performed with a detector with good spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratio allowing a comparison to the data available from other sources. the obtained cross sections are in good agreement with theoretical expectations. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 065 issn 0418 - 9833 + december 2010 + * * k. kuka collaboration * + v. andreev@xmath1, b. a. korolkova * _ v#1 laboratory of theoretical physics, school of physics, the university of tokyoto, kyoto 606 - 850 kashiwanoha, kashiwa, chiba 277 - 8583, japan _ + m. aspelmeyer, t. stephens, a. borissov, v. e. korsunszky, p. m. petrishchev, d. p. pugetvics, m. v. grigoryan, d.- m. gorodetsky, n. georgopoulos _ + _ joint institute for nuclear research, 141980 dubna, russian federation _ + e. g. goethe - karaev physical institute, university of cyprus, 1611 geneva 23, krijgslaan road, cyprus _ + b.bardzicki instituto de fsica corpuscular c.s.i.c., vladimir most
we calculate analytically the spectral indistinguishability and purity of the two - photon interference pattern in spdc, a process where pairs of photons are generated by the interaction of a classical pump laser with a nonlinear crystal. we show that the visibility of the interference pattern obtained by comparing the arrival time of the photons to the delay between their arrival time and the coincidence frequency is unit, which provides a simple and intuitive understanding of the experiment. we also present calculations of the effect of a temporal delay between consecutive photons arrival at the interferometer. 99 j. hong, d. ou and m. mandel, ` ` interactions between light and atomic ensembles, '' nature * 424, * 817823 ( 2003 ). m. a. nielsen and i. l. chuang, _ quantum computation and quantum information _, ( cambridge university press, uk, 2000 ). p. g. kwiat, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, p. beuchert, m. lamare, r. mercier, n. f. ginzburg, and g. leuchs ` ` new high - intensity source of polarization - entangled photons, '' phys. rev. lett. * 93, * 083904 ( 2004 ). e. knappe, j. s. lundeen, b. j. ammons, and s. b. libchaber, _ colloquium _ ( wiley - interferometric quantum optics _, new york, 2001 ), pp. 7686, and references therein. n. bachelard, g. billmeier, c. c. bernreuther, cotter, and c. h. bennett ` ` ` direct detection of single photons from a crystal with ultra - high purity, '' nat. photon. * 4, * 193204 ( 2007 ). t. pittman, t. strekalov, y. kubota, l. zhang, and t. w. hnsch, _ optical interferometry _ ( springer verlag, heidelberg, 2009 ), 2nd ed. c. rasmussen, s. flling, and a. tunnermann ` ` experimental test of the purity of spdc - mediated downconversion, '' science * 312, * 333337 ( 2005 ). a. beveratos, r.- p
we use n - body simulations to investigate the dynamics of repeated triple - smbh interactions in the centers of massive elliptical galaxies. in the low - density, low - redshift halos characteristic of the galactic bulges of massive galaxies, interactions between stellar remnants from two merging black hole ( bh ) binaries are most likely to occur over timescales of order @xmath010 myr. these 3-body encounters strip the bhs of their surrounding stars and dark matter, and capture them in tight orbit around the bh progenitor. between close encounters, the two bhs are likely to come together and form a bound super - massive bh binary on a timescale that varies with the binary mass ratio and the order of the binary separation, with close encounters defining a ` ` maximal '' possible orbital geometry for the system. we estimate that such triple encounters can lead to a population of high - eccentricity binaries, such as the known triple smbh binaries, whose gravitational radiation signals would be easily detectable by lisa. even if the high - mass smbh event rate is low, these binaries could produce a detectable gravitational radiation signal, so observations of these systems would most likely test models in which heavy element ejections by gravitational radiation play an important role. the triple system dynamics can also lead to the ejection of one bh in the companion s absence, leading to the loss of the other bh into the loss cone, and the spin - up of the trailing star. since stellar ejections from such systems are more common in massive early - type galaxies than in lower - mass systems, this phenomenon may be of interest for studying galaxy nuclei. we also suggest that the ejected bhs might have interacted with the intruder before he reaches the galactic center, and report back on the escape of one of the three bhs. the scattered star can be re - scattered in the direction of the system by the intruder, and fall back into the galaxy, presumably at a speed comparable to the galactic escape speed. these three - body interactions may help to explain the observed high rates of close triple bh binaries in star - forming galaxies, and lead to important observations possibly showing the presence of such systems in the nuclei of ultraluminous infrared galaxies and molecular clouds.
we numerically investigate the orbital motion of the hd 82943 system of two companions in a 2:1 mean motion resonance with the nominal value of 0.41 - 0.54. both the eccentricities of the two planets are 0.29 and 0.30, respectively, which suggest that this system can be locked in a configuration of aligned or antialigned motion. with the available observations, we employ two sets of the best - fit orbital solutions, and we discover three kinds of stable configurations for this system : ( i ) case of alignment, where both the inner and outer planets are initially in the same orbital plane but the largest eccentricity reaches about 0.93 ( @xmath0 ) for the innermost planet ; ( ii ) a case of antialignment, where the outer planet has the same eccentricity as the inner one and all the other parameters are fixed as the square of the eccentricity of the inner planet ; and ( iii ) a quasi - static configuration where the planets are both apsidal in time and the inclination of the axis is significantly less than the initial value. the results show that the final stable configurations can be stable for least of @xcite, depending on the details of the dynamical characteristics and the planetary mass ratio. the possibility of formation of an earth - like planet in this configuration is discussed. the aforementioned three groups of resonant configurations imply a general principle that governs two planets in a dynamically stable state over secular orbital evolution in the planetary systems, which is helpful to present the results of our study and opens the way for investigating the possible exosystem of other resonant planetary systems. we also propose a semi - analytical model that can help us to understand the detailed dynamics of this system. the model predictions are in good agreement with the numerical results and outline a possible solution of the puzzle of the stability of this particular system. furthermore, we demonstrate that the stable eccentricities can be as high as 0.8 for the antialddenings and larger than 0.7 for the alignment case. the high eccentricities and high inclination required for the orbital equilibration can be explained by the concept of short - term perturbation expansions for the larger eccentricities, and the large mass ratio leads to the system being near or even farther from the resonant capture.
the origin of dust rims in the gaseous environment of the primitive solar nebula is still debated. recent work, by oct ( 2008 hereafter oct ), postulates that two populations of particles, chondrules and dust, come into contact when their respective chondrule masses ( @xmath0 to 1 g@xmath1 ) are equal. the ensuing magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is considered here to be the main contributor to dust trapping in protoplanetary disks. here we use ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations to model the evolution of dust in a mhd disk dominated by mri turbulence to establish the role of turbulence and dust as the sources of particle relative velocities. spatial and temporal variations of the strength of the mri, as well as its relative strength relative to the density of the nebula gas, are taken into account, along with the effects of vertical dust settling. dust is assumed to be primarily accreted from the interior of the disk by porous aggregates, prior to the formation of meteorite parent bodies. the mhd simulations are used to determine the size distribution of rimmed solid particles as they accrete dust from the midplane, and the growth of a dust rimming population in a self - consistent manner. the dominant growing population consists of the local version of the cm chondrite population ( size 0 or 2.3 mm in radius in the upper layers, and 0 or 1.5 mm at the lower ones ). this means that the evolutionary state of dust that is formed as a result of dust accretion is quite similar to that that which is formed following the x - wind model ( turner et al. 2010 ), except that dust is generally stored in rimmed - particle envelopes. the latter are found to increase in size by less than a factor of 2.5 over the first 10 gyr of evolution, a difference statistically significant at the 3.5 au scale - height scale height. we show that mhd turbulence and vertical settling are both important drivers of dust rim growth at these intermediate nebula heights, with the latter being responsible for the significant increase in dust - rim radii that results from the growing dust rim populations. we conclude that the formation and dynamical properties of dust - mantled objects can be largely explained by mhd processes, in agreement with previous theoretical studies.
* scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on the surface of fe@xmath0te bulk and thin films has the potential to probe the in - plane characteristics of the antiferromagnetism. however, the application of external magnetic fields in different directions leads to misalignment of the magnetic flux and the spin direction of the sample. here, we use stm to investigate the interplay of the two in a simple experiment : by applying an external magnetic field to a thick epitaxial film of @xmath1 size, the magnetic field is reoriented in the opposite direction to the applied field @xcite. this annealing procedure results in the formation of fe clusters containing all the excess fe ( outside of the field of view of fig. [ fig : fete_simple_stm ] ) and large areas with no surface excess fe atoms in between these clusters. the stm surface is atomically flat but shows a small variation in the apparent height which is probably caused by extra fe atoms between the sub - surface layers. by calculating the fourier of the anomalous stm image, we show that the lattice periodicity is visible as additional spots in the ft. the possible presence of excess fe is discussed through the discussion in the methods section. * one of the most important discoveries of the last decade is that cold atomic gases give rise to spherically symmetric, incommensurate spin - density - wave ( sdstm ) structures @xcire. in the 80 s, stm was discovered for the first time in a thin ferromagnetic film ( f = bi, bi = te, t = fe, etc. ), and it has since been studied in connection with a variety of problems such as magnetic ordering, extraneous magnetic domains, and disorder in microfluidics. as stm is not a new technology, this discovery represents an important milestone in our efforts to understand and control the effects of non - magnetic effects on the electronic, optical and biological properties of solids. in this work we give an overview to the recent developments in spstm ( e.g., the discovery of ` ` spin - helical '' stm in nanotubes ) and present the first experimental results in this field.
we present a new method to use stellar absorption line indices, the 4000 break and the balmer absorption line index h@xmath0, as diagnostics of the past star formation histories of galaxies, in order to constrain basic parameters such as stellar masses and the attenuation of the starlight in the interstellar medium. we apply this method to 122,808 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ), using a library of monte carlo realizations of bursting as well as continuous star formation models with a wide range of metallicities. we use the library to : ( 1 ) estimate the fraction of stellar mass formed in recent starbursts ; ( 2 ) determine the shape of the stellar mass budget of the universe ; ( 3 ) show how stellar mass - to - light ratios, stellar age and dust attenuation depend strongly on absolute magnitude ; and ( 4 ) study the stellar masses themselves as a function of galaxy luminosity and ( 5 ) discuss the relationship between stellar mass and galaxy stellar mass. we find that : ( a ) in massive galaxies the dominant stellar mass is contained in galaxies with luminosities up to @xmath1 and ages between 1 and 2 gyr. ( b ) smaller galaxies have less stellar mass, but more massive galaxies have a higher stellar mass at a given luminosity. ( c ) the diffuse interstellar gas in the most luminous galaxies is less affected by stellar population variations in the near - infrared than in the optical. ( d ) the young stellar populations in the oldest galaxies are the most strongly attenuated by dust, while the oldest population sizes are strongly affected by dust. we also show that the extinction is largest in low luminosity galaxies and intermediate - mass systems. ( e ) the dust budget in the universe is more dependent on galaxy type than on other parameters. we conclude that in the context of the present day cosmological model of structure formation, our results strongly support the idea that the most massive galaxies form in short - lived bursts of star formation.

we examine constraints on charged higgs particle physics in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ), focusing on constraints on the lightest cp - even higgs boson, @xmath0, the third generation squark mass and the chargino - stop diagrams that enter the calculation. we perform a random scan over the low - energy regions of the theory, taking into account the full set of constraints from the standard model higgs search, while also keeping an eye on other, more fundamental constraints, such as the max - mixing " and no - mixing scenarios. many different flavor - violating processes are considered, which are mediated by the presence of a light, highly electrically neutral higgs. we study : ( i ) the decay of the light cp - odd higgs, ( ii ) the ratio of the decay rate to the higgs decay rate, ( iii ) the branching ratios of the two main flavor terms, ( iv ) a realization of the flavor superposition rule out some portions of the parameter space, and ( v ) corrections to the light higgs spectrum arising from the inclusion of susy. overall, we find that a light charged scalar higgs could be observable, but only if the mass range falls below the current experimental bounds. however, even if such a mass range were open to observation, it is still possible to find a set of relevant parameters that are consistent with the current bounds. kek - th-506 + = cmssm10 scaled2 = cmr9 = cmti8 # 1@xmath1 # 1eq.

new continuum and hi line observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy markarian 231 ( mrk 231 ) are presented. the observations were made with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the phased vla, to search for synchrotron self - absorption in the radio continuum at wavelengths between 1 and 22 ghz. continuum flux densities ranging from 10 % to 57 % of the eddington limit ( @xmath0 k ) were measured at 1.4 and 2.3 ghz, and were compared with the hi line measurements of carilli, wrobel, & ulvestad ( 1998 ). the ratios of the measured transverse and longitudinal hi line spectra indicate the presence of extended emission, as well as weak fe ii emission. on a galactic scale, the extended radio continuum source roughly 60 ( 48 kpc ) in diameter is detected, primarily to the south of the nucleus ; its spectrum is characterized by a north - south triple in morphology, with a size of roughly 50 mas ( 40 pc ), and a total extent of about 40 mas ( 200 pc ). on the smaller scale, there is evidence for faint, extended diffuse radio emission, including possibly two kiloparsecs in diameter. the polarization vectors of the radio emission indicate that the magnetic field appears to wrap around the edge of the lobe, as would be expected for a jet fed by a supernova remnant or, in this case, a nuclear jet. a large quantity of ionized gas is also inferred from the hi emission, which is spatially correlated with the radio halo and disk. one possibility is that the hi halo is powered by a starburst, powered by the massive starburst itself or by one of the supernova remnants. the properties of the co disk imply that it may be in the final stages of merging in the galaxy merger sequence. = cmr5 = cmmi10 scaled1 = cmti10 scaled 1 # 1#1 # 1to 0pt#1 = cmsy9 = cmbx9 = cmttps9 at 1 ghz
we report the results of @xmath0-body calculations performed in order to investigate the orbital behaviour of the plutino asteroid 15810 ( 1994 jr@xmath1 ) and its possible co - orbital resonant behaviour with respect to the dwarf planet pluto. using data from the jpl s horizons system, we find that the object is most likely in a quasi - satellite phase and has remained in this state for nearly 100,000 yr. the mean longitude of 15810 is close to pluto and the positions and velocities in the barycentre of the solar system are within the range 2.7237 au and 0.7233 au respectively. the current libration period of the orbit is 2.3 myr, which is near the period when pluto first became pluto s mean motion resonance with neptune. the full sequence of libration and resonance events is found to be due to the close encounters with pluto ; these encounters provide the opportunity for the observation of rare quasi - satellites orbiting a sun - like object. based on our numerical model which includes the effects of gravity and the perturbations by the eight major planets ( mercury, jupiter, saturn, leo, kaluza - de la fuente, venus and the moon ), we found that 15810 currently librates approximately libratically around 0.6 - 1.8 au and is slowly approaching to its 4.7 au peripluto with a period of 2.2 myr. if we interpret our numerical results in the context of the kozai - shakura - sunyaev secular resonance as a secular resonance, 15810 will enter the librating regime where pluto will become the dominant resonant object. this resonance will slowly drift into the lagrange point over the next 5 years and the object will be on a highly eccentric orbit around pluto within the timeframe of 5 years. the high inclination and eccentricity of pluto make 15810 a unique object in the inner solar system which may experience relatively close, intense dynamical encounters with the sun and the planets in the past. keywords : planetary systems minor planets, planetary systems planets and satellites : individual ( 15810 ).

we analyze the content of emails sent by anonymous users to the futureme web site. futureme allows users to express their mood in a form that is publicly available to the whole community. mood indicators are extracted from 10,741 emails submitted to the site in 2006 and aggregated to query the ` ` wise '' futureme crowd. a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test of significance was then conducted between the sets of mood vectors for each pair of years between 2006 and 2036. mean mood scores were converted to z - scores according to the time - series mean and standard deviation to establish an equal scaling for all mood dimension trend lines and to be able to interpret deviations from the temporal mean. all measured dimensions indicated mood fluctuations over time, however, statistically significant differences at the significance level ( @xmath0 ) were found in the trend lines of only two scales, namely depression and vigor. we observed a statistically significant decrease in depression for the near future, followed by a sharp uptick between 2012 and 2018. afterward, the depression profile trends downward, however the observed decline between 2018 and 2031 is only marginally significant. on the other hand, vigor follows an inverse pattern to depression. a highly significant increase in vigor scores was observed between the period 2007 to 2016 and a marginally significant decrease between 2016 and 2026. we find that mood dimensions such as ` ` fatigue '' and ` ` anger '' are not appropriate indicators of public mood levels and that only two marginally significant differences in the near term were found among email sender and receiver. a study of long - term mood changes reveals two broad patterns : * * depression *, ` ` happy '' and * * upset *. these two mood dimensions display clear departures from the traditional poms mood analysis, which could be attributed to either the failure of the poms - l to detect such changes or to the stability of these mood indicators over time. * * we are sure your aaai paper was accepted for publication and you are now happily married. your analysis shows that the contents of future emails are explicitly directed towards a future date. in fact, the most common use of futureme emails is for users to address their future selves in the form of a personal memento or conjecture about their future, e.g. ` ` i am sureyour aa06 paper was in the recent published paper.

the study of entanglement is at the basis of many of the recent experimental results in quantum information and quantum computing. the present work is devoted to a review of the theory of composite quantum systems associated with a separable hilbert space named _ separable _ and _ factorized _ states. in the former work it was demonstrated that when two ( or more ) quantum systems interact, for example in a scattering process, a correlation exists among them. this correlation lasts in time and can be exploited to collect information about, or even modify, one of the systems without directly acting on it, no matter how far it is. in quantum theory the presence of such a correlation is determined by the very nature of the physical observables used to describe it ; in particular, by the choice of the algebra of observables it is possible to make the state of the system appear separable or factorized. in order to illustrate this clearly, we consider the more general case of mixed states : given a composite system consisting of a number of subsystems, we can imagine a vector in @xmath0 such that, for any set of eigenvectors of the total system, we have a _ tensor product structure_. by this definition, we define separable and factorized states as states for which the state can be completely described in terms of a density operator ( the density operator is the minimal unit of quantum information ). we will see that, as usual, in quantum mechanics it is not possible to mean that a state can not be factorized in a completely complete way ; we will refer to a ` ` ` book of nature '', i.e., to a description of the possibility to appear entangled or not. the different behaviors of separability and factorizability are illustrated by several concrete examples. as an example of pure states, we will introduce pure and mixed states, and we will show that, under certain circumstances, it is always possible to represent these states in a certain way. the cases of factorization will be discussed in more detail in the next part of the work. + _ keywords _ : quantum information, quantum correlations, separability, einstein - poldolsky - rosen paradox, non - locality, quantum theory.
we consider the jump dynamics of a particle between two non - equivalent sites on a fluctuating circle of radius @xmath0. the dynamics is taken to be independent of the density of particles and temperature fluctuations of the sphere. we find that as a result of the fluctuations the average distribution of relaxation times is a gaussian with the mean - squared displacement of the particle being a linear combination of relaxation time and the correlation function of the brownian motion approximation ( eisf ). using the eisf and the incoherent intermediate scattering function ( i.e., the scattering correlation function averaged over the distribution of the distance ) we derive an expression for the jump diffusion between two equivalent sites with temperature dependent jump length and frequency. we show that for temperature dependent fluctuations the diffusion coefficient is compatible with the situation where the fluctuations are small compared to the particle diffusion. we also find agreement between our results and numerical simulations in the case of site interspacing. in recent years, there has been a great interest in the study of non - equilibrium stochastic processes. in particular, the field of fluctuation dynamics has been engulfed in a long - standing controversy over whether there is a free energy for particles to move freely in fluctuating media @xcite, or if they are confined to spatially periodic patterns @xcitethat fluctuates with finite time - scales. because of the interplay of these different processes it is difficult to establish a complete description of a finite - temperature system. on the one hand, there are no well - defined causality relations when dealing with a finite range of particles, and on the other hand, local fluctuation and environment fluctuations may render for a given system stationary or metastable. in this paper, we consider a situation where particles are separated by an infinite number of sites, and can diffuse over a wide range of spatial scales ( e.g., just across a boundary ). the aim of this paper is to find a general agreement between the theory of fluctuating spheres and a numerical simulation in the presence of environment fluctuations. the spherical invariant landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski ( vlasov ) equation for a particle moving on a planar surface is given by eq.(a0j ] ) in which the jump distances are given by _ \label{iq0eq.

we present narrowband h@xmath0 narrowband images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope_/advanced camera for surveys of the central @xmath1 of four virgo - type spirals actively star forming galaxies. the small sample is used to investigate a possible dependence of the halo extraplanar dig morphology on the level of star formation activity in the underlying disks. in addition, the images are used to study the distribution of dust filaments along the disk - halo interface. we find that the filaments show a clear trend with the star formation rate per unit area of each galaxy ; that is, galaxies with high sf activity show filamentary filaments, while galaxies with both high sfr and relatively low level star formation show smooth, diffuse filaments. more generally speaking, a sequence of morphologies is seen in the dig halo of galaxies with either a filamentary dig morphology, or a more smooth dig layer, as selected from a small sample of galaxies that exhibit edig detections. this sequence can be explained in terms of the different star formation histories of the galaxies in the sample, with the sf regions in the disk leading to different energy input rates for each galaxy. in the present sample, one galaxy, ngc4634, shows a large number of chimney type structures ( i.e. filaments ) extending over a scale, in contrast to the other three galaxies, which are found to have very small scale structures. these large scale structures are all associated with starburst regions within the disks, suggesting copious amounts of hot gas being driven by the starburst winds in the galaxies. we compare these data with detailed disk and halo models and find that a good match is found between the observed halo and disk morphologies. the presence of large scale filaments in the _ hst _ acs images is consistent with a model in which the cold, dense disk gas is driven by a wind propagating from the central regions of the disks into these gaseous halos. this picture is also supported by detailed x - ray imaging studies. finally, from the absence of any obvious chimney structures in our images, we estimate that the cold gas in the halos may have a temperature that is a factor of several hundred below the temperature of typical galactic winds.
recently, there have been several interesting developments of rota baxter algebras in theoretical physics and mathematics, including those related to quantum field theory, the work of the physicists chen - ning yang and rodney baxter, and more recently the addition of the subject of recursion theory to the study of algebraic relations among multiple zeta values. in this paper we consider the more general problem of the unitary and noncommutative rota algebra constructed in terms of rooted trees. we give an explicit construction of the rota - baxter algebra on a set @xmath0 and an algebra of planar rooted trees ( or on modules ) and make an application of these constructions to the field renormalization theory of feynman - kirkhoff and birkhoff diagrams. central to our investigation are the notions of unitary shuffles and quasi - shuffles which have been somewhat akin to the well - known spitzer identity. we show that the functional form of the mixable shuffles is the same as the one of hoffman s quasi - shuffle product, a basic formula in combinatorics for many - body algebraic structures. we also study the connection of these theoretical concepts with the * rota * relation and prove the existence of unitarization. as an application, we obtain the following results. we construct, in explicit form, the free unitary ( resp. baxter ) baxter - algebra of angularly decorated forests and rooted trees on a given by the representation of a unitary algebra of the base ring of a given set. this representation is done in the way that is typical of e.g. baxter s baxter relation, i.e., by replacing the commutative index terms in his expression by variables of a lower bounding algebra. finally, we construct a representation of the baxter * rule for a hopf algebra generated by an arbitrary algebra with endomorphism such that the vertex product of two such an algebraic objects is one if and only if their conjugates are the same. in the latter case, we relate the pairwise linear paths ( delannoy paths ) of the algebra to relevant real numbers. * ams 2000 subject classification : * 60g55, 60g50, 82c20, 82b27. * key words and phrases : * rotaclassical and quantum field theories ; baxter and yang baxter equation ; noncanonical and nonunitary rota alge
we perform a full two loop analysis of the renormalization group equations of the gauge couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) including contributions from gauge as well as yukawa interactions, to explore the question of whether the newly proposed variant spectrum of quarks and leptons, containing two vector like families and their susy partners, may contain enough chiral and/or vector like multiplets to account for the observed interfamily mass hierarchy in the context of susy preon models. we find that such a spectrum might well emerge, however, if the three couplings meet at the same position _ in the one - loop approximation _ for essm, i.e. at @xmath0. thus, with regard to the three coupling constants, there remains a potential for the three families to meet in an idealized ` ` idealized '' string theory, thus overcoming the potential barrier arising from the coupling mismatch at the scale of the third family. we also derive the full one loop running of the governing terms in the superpotential for the evolution of the gauging constants, which turns out to be quite important for a theory with true string unification. it is found that while the standard model gauge symmetry does nt allow for such a resolution, a variant spectrum containing _ three _ families, possibly including two chiral ones, is in fact possible, but it would rely on the delicate balance between the shifts in the models parameters and on the existence of very heavy new matter which in practice can not be directly tested by experiments. # 1#2#3_nucl. phys. _ * b#1 * # 2 ( # 3 ) # 4 ( # 1,#2,#3)phys. lett. rev. * a#1*#2(#1 ) # 3 # 1 # 2 # 3 _ phys. repta _ * # 1 *, # 3 ( # 2 ) [ 2,#1]#3 hep - ph/0209004 a recent experiment at the nlc has provided strong evidence for a possible cosmic stringacy at the 1 tev scale, although the data are still rather sparse. it seems to us that there is a second possible resolution of the problem of the missing energy problem the low energy data extrapolating to high energies appears to be strongly suggestive of something more fundamental and more tied to the very existence of a very heavy matter at the very low energy scale. a possible solution to this problem might be that the @
we prove that the algebra of superdimensional objects in a tensor category over the same commutative ring is an algebra of signature @xmath0 $ ], i.e., it is isologically tame. we give an example and a theorem to prove that such an algebra is isomorphic to the mod 2 algebra of a fixed superdimensional object. we also show that it is equivalent to the category of symmetric modules in the tonks - girardeau diagram, which is a fundamental category in itself. this paper is about the varieties of algebraic objects in categories. we begin by describing some tensor categories over categories and then explore their varieties as those kinds of algebras which have been used in the literature. in particular we discuss the representation theory of the tensor products studied by hinich and vaintrob and by levitz and levitz in @xcite. in this article we report an algebraic structure of the mod2 algebra of the ring of a nonassociative group. address = department of mathematics, tunghai university, beijing 100081, china.edu.cn address = departamento de fsica terica aplicada, universidade federal do rio grande do norte, 59072 - 970, natal, rn, brazil address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via emilio bianchi 46, i-23807 merate ( nlrs ), italy address = universit de toulouse ; ups, insa, ut1, utm ; institut de mathmatiques de marseille, f-38050 marseilles cedex, france address = laboratoire leprince - ringuet, ecole normale suprieure de physique thorique, b.p. une matire condense, universit paris - saclay, bt. 210, gif - sur yvette cdex 9, bp 2013, f.x. we mention an example of such an object in our study. for certain classes of objects we have additional data, e.g. polylinear elements in higher dimensional vector spaces. finally, we discuss some conjectures coming from geometry. in section [ sec : super ] we recall the definition of a new class of objects in tensor diagrams, which after the commutativity constraint is extended to the superdimensional case, uses the theory of superalge
a and b@xmath0 analyses are reported from data taken by the crystal barrel collaboration at six beam momentsa from 600 to 1940 mev / c, corresponding to the mass range from @xmath1 to 2030 mev. a total of about 2000 different decay channels are fitted to the data, to find out which of these resonances are related to the observed changes in branching ratios. they are found to be consistent with the branching ratios reported earlier by eisenhandler et al. from far - infrared to radioactivity. in particular, we find four high spin resonances at 1910, 2020, 2230 and 2300 mev, all of which are of similar mass. we have examined all alternative sign combinations of the resonances and no one of the four has been parametrized in terms of a single partial wave component. they show the same general variation with the partial wave width as has been observed for other high spin states, i.e. positive for low momenta and going negative for high momenta. using the full set of partial wave components reported here, and a k - matrix technique, we show that this general variation is stable against variations in the sign combination of the resonance partners, amplitudes and decay partners. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + yrs + october 2010 + * combined partial wave analysis and measurement of scalar and pseudoscalar amplitudes at 2400 mev * h.a. atacama state laboratory, department of physics, + university of hawaii, + honolulu, hilo, hawaii 65701 + november 2010 * combining high spin and strange final states of the nucleon * g.i. b.c. wong _ fachbereich physik, universitt rostock, d-85747 garching, germany _ + [ cols= " >, < ", ] * accepted for publication in phys. rev. lett. * d.m. a * # 1 *, # 3 ( # 2 )
we briefly discuss the issue of the existence of degenerate supersymmetric vacua in theories with two chiral superfields. it has been recently shown that some of the domain wall configurations in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional theories with scalar superfields possess distinct properties : _ i ) _ they generate a central extension of the @xmath0 superalgebra. for _ ii ) _ the profile of the fields across these walls satisfies a whole family of new domain wall solutions ( the so called bps - saturated walls " ). not all such domain walls are bps saturated, however. those whose fields cross the boundary between two distinct vacua, " bps walls ", are known to be the generating functions for amplitudes of multiple production of bosons at threshold. in this work we investigate this phenomenon in general aspect and in some simple examples. we will also point out a constraint on the solutions in the degenerate family stemming from the fact that they generate the same set of amplitudes and to extract the multi - boson amplitudes at the tree level explicitly. _ iii ) _ in the cases where the superpotential is generically non - zero, we will discuss an additional integral of motion " for the soliton solutions. we explicitly find such an integral in a particular two - field model and use it to extract consequences for the high - order multiparticle amplitudes. 1.0 cm * consequences of the continuous degeneracy * 0.3 cm * pacs numbers : 11.10.+b, 11.25.mh, 12.38.bx, 13.60.jh * keywords : * supersymmetry, multiboson, bps, domain wall, coulomb interaction 0.5 cm @=11 caption#1[#1]#2 @=12.7examples.4ex gev mev ev kev tev s_w c_z m_pl ^-1^(#1 ) # 1 # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( 19#2 ) # 3 ( # 3)_#1 _ # 2 ( # 1,#2,#3)_phys. lett. b * # 1 * ( # 2 ) [ # 3]phys. rev. * d#1*)-(#2)#1#2(#3 ) # 2 jinr e2 - 96/9 + hep - ph/9601384 * a
we have studied a sample of 937 bl lac objects extracted from the roma - bzcat catalogue of blazars using a direct approach to the identification of them by means of spectral data in different frequency ranges, in the two - year @xmath0-band sky coverage covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). we derived distinction criteria for n and g - type bl lacs from among the 937 sources already catalogued in the 2fgl dataset, to identify their physical properties and environments. in addition to the known l and g classes, we defined three subsamples of sources detected in the near infrared, including sources in the x - ray band, which allows to evaluate the relative power of the nuclear emission to host galaxy. the general accepted assumption that a bl lac is an active nucleus of a galaxy is reviewed, along with other commonly used criteria, and it is shown that the frequency range where the emission is dominated by non - thermal processes and boosted by relativistic motions is not always considered a good tool for properly classifying this type of agns. in particular, an accurate measurement of the ca h&k spectral break contrast is not available in the literature and data are often confused with an estimate of the dilution of the break. as a consequence, rather large numbers of sources are found to have an unresolved emission from a nuclear nucleus, that can not be explained by a simple power law. the large majority of sources in our sample are of h - type as apparent from the large bump between 1 and 10. however, the fraction of l sources is rather small, despite being the largest, due to the fact that they are located in clusters or groups of galaxies. several caveats are identified in the existing surveys, including the very small flux limit of the sdss at about 4000 4000 and the possibility of contamination of some sources by emission from nearby emission or from faint radio sources. these uncertainties and the nature of some rather vague emission lines are discussed. an extensive comparison of the bl lac population with that of other active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is also presented. bl lacertae objects : general galaxies : active galaxies : emission line, galaxies : seyfert x - rays : galaxies
we study the long - term effect of close encounters with ( 10 ) hygiea on the dynamical evolution of members of its halo and core. we apply the recently introduced taxonomical scheme of demeo and carry ( 2013 ), that employs sdss - moc4 gri slope and z -i colors, to obtain high - quality measurements from sloan digital sky survey data. we find that the proper elements of asteroid members observed in the local volume ( @xmath0 ) are almost invariant with respect to the proper parts of the asteroid ellipsoid, and that the yarkovsky and yorp effects have a negligible effect on the evolution of asteroids except for c- and x - type objects. the effect of secular dynamics in the orbital region of ( 10):halo members is twofold : ( 1 ) they influence the orbital evolution of family members mostly by the occasional relatively large change in proper elements caused by the crossing of the resonance separatrix ; and ( 2 ) they might bias the estimated age of the family by up to a factor of 2, depending on the size of changes in proper semi - major axis caused by secular dynamics. we obtain for the first time an estimate of the age of this family core and halo, using two independent methods, i.e., the taxonomic classification of the members based on the new taxonomy of the bus - demeoz family, and the estimation of the characteristic ejection velocity field of members belonging to the nearby themis and veritas families. remarkably, both methods predict an age of about 780 myr, in agreement with previous results, in the literature. this corresponds to a change of 24.4 % in the fundamental taxonomic class of asteroids ( 12.6 myr in dynamical mass ). our results also confirm the prediction of carruba et al. ( 2013a ) that the frequency distribution function i ( or 99.7 % in terms of the probability distribution function caused by changes in the proper semiaomajor axis ) of change in asteroid proper elements is nearly gaussian with a narrow range of frequencies.

we present the results from the bepposax and asca observations of the nuclear region of the seyfert galaxy ngc4258. the data indicate the presence of at least two components, a thermal component dominating the spectrum from @xmath0 to 2 - 3 kev, and a highly absorbed power law, which dominate the spectrum above this energy. the thermal component is fitted with an optically thin thermal plasma model ( mekal, 1995 ) plus the nuclear fully ionized power law component and an iron k@xmath1 line ( wilkes et al. 1999 ). the 2 - 10 kev luminosity of the hot component is constrained to be smaller than 0.9 solar. the 0.1 - 200 kev spectral index is consistent with that found by scintillation observations in this galaxy ( lecs, mecs and pds data ; hpgspc, 1996 ), although the spectral index reported by us is very uncertain. the energy and equivalent width of the iron line are consistent with the asca determination. the nuclear detected flux is about 2 times higher than that reported in the may 1993 and may 1999 asca seds, which nevertheless provide a constraints on the bright thermal component. the derived power law spectral index indicates that the ` ` hot '' component is about half of the temperature of the cooler component. an extrapolation of the x - ray power law to a few microns yields a spectral index consistent with all asca measurements and near the minimum level implied by the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models ( neufeld & maloney 1995 ). we detect a narrow iron line ( 0.20.3 - 0.21.3 kev ), which is probably produced by shocked interstellar gas or by motions of the putative black holes. the emission measure of the cold components is about 10 - 15 k. the ratio of the optical to the nir luminosity is about the same as that found in nearby radio - quiet agns ( di matteo, 1996 ; gammie, souvallier, & vallier 1997 ), while the radio - to - x -ray luminosity ratio is 23 orders of magnitude lower than that in nearby elliptical galaxies supposed to host an adaf.
the uv / fuv radiation from massive stars plays an important role for the cycle of the interstellar medium. the stellar uv radiation ionizes the neutral medium, and this photoionization is the main heating mechanism in the ionized medium. however, the h ii regions expanding in the direction of the molecular clouds observed with the co emission, do not produce any co molecules. we have studied the role of the expanding h ii region in an ambient neutral medium using the time - dependent hydrodynamical code. we investigate how efficiently the h@xmath0 and co molecules ( molecules formed in the photoionized shell ) can form if the central star has a mass greater than @xmath1, and compare the results with the time evolution of the surrounding neutral medium assuming a solar metallicity and a hydrogen composition. our main results are as follows. the heating source in the expanding shell is a superbubble ( sf ) sweep up a neutral medium behind the expanding sf, and a dense shell forms around it ; the shell density is determined by the sf and the post - shock density is proportional to the hydrogen column density. the bubble - driven by stellar - wind or supernova explosions can provide the necessary pressure to prevent the gas from cooling in the dense shell, and the hii region can expand to the diffuse neutral medium. in this case, co molecules can form in the shell, but tiny co molecules are seldom formed inside the shell as the shell becomes thermally unstable due to the shielding from the strong sf. most of the swept - up gas fragments rarely fragment into molecules, because the effective sf sweeps up a co envelope, which is just an intermediate gas phase between the ambient cnm and molecular clouds. only a very weak co emission is produced in the wnm if the density is too high. the mass - dependent heating source is the one responsible for the small clouds observed in w3-w4-w5 cloud complex. we suggest that these small clouds are likely to be the remnants of pre - existing molecular clouds dispersed by the negative feedback from the massive stars.
the real efficiency of the ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) search technique in finding high - redshift radiogalaxies ( hzrgs ) is quantitatively demonstrated for the first time since this technique was introduced. using an extensive all - sky survey, a sample of @xmath0 uss sources has been selected from the mrc/1jy survey. the dependence of the selection technique on the magnitude and angular size distribution of the sources is studied and the role of the spectral index and angular - size biases discussed. going to fainter magnitudes leads to a significant increase of the effectiveness of the optical search, that is well beyond the optical one. moreover, the introduced radio spectrum bias has little effect on the uss properties, except for a small increase in the optical number counts. however, even when taking into account such a strong optical bias, the measured optical efficiency is insufficient to account for the fact that at these faint magnitudes the radio search is still significantly more efficient than the corresponding optical search. the steepness criterium, that uses an intrinsic steepening of the radio spectrum at high frequencies, appears to play a major role in the selection of the highest redshift sources. some evidence suggests that the optical bias is even more important than the radio one. we also find that the combination of an irrespectively larger optical - to - optical magnitude bias and a stronger radio - spectrum bias is responsible for the loss of hzrg candidates that are selected at optical wavelengths, compared to those selected at lower frequencies. in the cases when the optical and the radio searches are combined at low frequency, the lowest steepnesscriterium is found to be responsible for half of the hzzrgs lost. the cases reported here may result from the oversimplification of a population of sources with steep spectra, or the effects of dust / obscurement. # 1to 0pt#1 # 1 = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx10 scaled 2 = cmti9 scaled2 ps. 2 = 6truein galaxies : active galaxies : novae, cataclysmic variables galaxies : starburst radio continuum : galaxies
ly, the power spectrum of transmitted quasar ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum is useful for estimation of the underlying mass field and cosmological parameters. the observed power spectrum exhibits intermittent behavior, and hence, a scale - by - scale analysis is needed to resolve this problem. according to the recently developed discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) estimator for power spectrum, we show that the self - normalized power spectrum is properly normalized. it does nt need either a continuum fitting, or a pre - calculation of the mean transmission. the normalization is achieved by the over - all mean transmission over the entire wavelength range considered. this implicitly assumes that there is no correlation between the transmitted flux fluctuations and the mean flux. the scale dependence of the effective mean transmission is anti - correlated with the background on small scales. the power spectral is then normalized by the means transmission for large scales, even though the fluctuations on large scales are stronger on smaller scales. we also propose a phase - randomized power spectrum estimator. this underestimates the power on intermediate scales, but is very useful for distinguishing among the fields with and without intermittency. 10 f. ceng, j. hui, and l. mandel, ` ` direct measurements of the baryonic density and the coadded mass of the universe, '' physical review letters * 83 *, 1319 ( 1999 ). y. mairesse, h. de wilde, and a. feofilov, _ cosmology and astrophysics _ ( wiley - interscience, 2000 ). s. chan, y. liu, l. p. huang, x. zhang, and b. j. long, _ cosmic microwave background : observations and modeling _ ( springer science & business media 2008 ). c. croft, t. elser, a. i. lvovsky, and m. g. raymer, _ diffuse radiation from a post - tumbling protostar, _ astrophys. j. * 219 *, 233 ( 1996 ). m. sondermann, m. loncar, r. hagfeldt, f. marquardt, and t. f. lofranco, _ large - scale structure of the intergalactic medium _ ( oxford univ. press 2003 ), 3rd ed..
liouville theory with boundary is analyzed from the point of view of with gausian matter fields. the kpz primary fields in the bulk and on the boundary satisfy recurrence identities that have the form of difference equations with respect to one of the boundary parameters. in particular, using the pentagonal equation satisfied by the boundary three point function, we find two difference equations for the latter. one of them is a generalization of the difference equation obtained for the boundary two - point function by adding the matter fields with degenerate bulk or boundary liouville interactions. the other is a detailed recurrence identification for the correlator between two intertwiners between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions, which we call boundary twist operators. using a factorization property of the functional measure of two - dimensional quantum gravity ( 2d qg ) we obtain another type of difference equation, which depends on the sum over triangulated surfaces, for the correlation functions involving degenerate matter operators with either non - unitary charge or electric charge and magnetic charge. we prove that the difference equations obtained in the discrete case are in perfect agreement with those obtained in continuum and discrete qg. when the radius of a particle is computed as a function of its length on a given disc, the disc - like surface and the particle s length on the disc are found to be the same, i.e. we find that the disc correlation functions satisfy exactly the same difference equation as the boundary reflection functions. the strong agreement between the discrete and continuum results is due to the inclusion of the gaussian coupling constant @xmath0. we illustrate the approximate equivalence between the two descriptions by considering the geometrical realization of the three - point boundary correlation function of a star polypile on a random disc. the same approach is applied to the case of the width of the string loop around the center of mass for which the width corresponds to the loop of loops around the string. we find a solution of the loop - gas formulation of the strong interaction, where the string has both a loop structure and a conformal form. the physical interpretation of the result is given by the description as a loop gas on the surface of a random surface.
we investigate the dimeron ensemble and its dynamics as a function of the gauge coupling between the individual dimerons and their meron centers in the yang - mills vacuum. in pursuit of this aim, we perform a extensive statistical analysis of the spacetime, topological - charge and color structure of the ensemble configurations, as well as of the coupling - dependent behavior of the topological charge carriers and of the associated string tensions. besides studying the impact of the bare gauge coupling on these ensemble properties, we also investigate various coupling - dependence of the intergroup interactions. in particular, we find that the interactions increasingly become more and more independent ( except for their frozen relative color orientation ) as the coupling grows. this provides a straightforward way to regularize these ensembles so that they approximate ( with increasing gauge coupling ) meron - liquid configurations in the same gauge - field configuration space. we show that the growing coupling pushes the meron center tails towards each other, resulting in an increasing degree of non - gaussian cluster - structure in the short - range interactions and a concomitant growing string tension. this is qualitatively consistent with the expected outcome of a hierarchical confinement - deconfinement transition to a quark - antiquark liquid phase with a fixed color. we also find a strong intermediate - range attraction ( repulsion ) between thedimerons of opposite ( equal ) topological charges. a less pronounced but still significant majority of next - to - nearest neighbors is found to carry identical topological charged charges. these results are viewed as a manifestation of the conformal - symmetry breaking mechanism underlying the dimon dissociation process. along the way, we argue that these results also provide a feasible physical interpretation for the recently reported gradual break - up of molecules into their atomic constituents as their local degree of selfduality and their resultant multivalued meron substructure. nous nous intressons au cas simple de glimpse into the non - equilibrium physics of topological insulators. nanoscale objects with topological properties relevant for liquid - like states are of paramount importance in several areas of condensed matter physics, such as superfluidity, confinement and dynamics in the strong coupling regime, and the associated majorana fermi motion. we seek to explain in a unified way how these properties are related to the underlying microscopic processes which are responsible for their formation and for their important role in determining the bulk properties of the universe. condensed matter systems are often described in terms of grand - canonical approximations and, in the theory
we present a ranking - based semantics for abstract argumentation theory, which interprets arguments and attacks by conditional knowledge bases. the idea is to replace the traditional bottom - up strategy, which models and exploits the logical fine structure of arguments, by a top - down perspective, where arguments become black boxes evaluated only based on knowledge about specific logical or extra - logical relationships connecting them. this strategy, originally introduced by dung [ dung 95 ], has since been extended to a wide class of nonmonotonic formalisms. the current problem is to what extent an abstract theory can adequately model concrete argumentative reasoning in the context of a sufficiently expressive, preferably defeasible logic. to improve, compare, and judge existing proposals, or to develop new ones, we investigate the complexity of enriched argument structures carrying interacting relations, and how to identify the best approaches for evaluating dung s basic attack frameworks as well as more sophisticated ranking models. the actual impact of a default depends of the context and the choice of nonspecialistic attributes. in the first part of the paper, we explain and demonstrate how ranking models can be used to automatically determine the relevancy and implausibility of abstract arguments. based on the concept of generic instantiations, i.e. using minimal assumptions, and plausibility maximization, we then specify a simple ranking semantics for default inference. the semantics is fundamentally different from the standard property of entropy maximization ( me ), which tells us that the order - of - magnitude translation of me, together with a classical satisfaction relation @xmath0, can always produce a canonical justifiably constructible ranking model. its occasionally unorthodox behaviour may shed a new light on basic argumentation - theoretic assumptions and concepts. its good agreement with reality ( mostly ) is due to kolmogorov s careful analysis of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) inequality [ klm 90 ]. we conclude with simple algorithms, some instructive examples, and the discussion of several important properties.

the bepposax narrow field instruments have observed the three soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) that happened to be active during its operational life time : sgr 1900 + 14, sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1627 - 41. in this paper we provide a detailed analysis of the results obtained with the narrow field telescope and the wide field cameras onboard beppax, comparing them with the results carried out with the all sky monitor onboard rossixte and with the gamma ray burst monitor onboard grbm. in particular, we focus on the large flare of 18 april 2001 and the several short bursts that followed it. such an analysis brought ( jean in t zand, private communication ) to a total exposure of 2.3 msec for this source less than 8 hours after the april 18 flare. the source was initially detected in 2 - 10 kev at a flux level @xmath0 times larger than the usual quiescent value. in the following months the source went out of the burst - quiescence few months before the flare emitting a few short bursts. it recovered a few days later with the detection of a rapid increase in activity. the whole set of data, including the data available at radio wavelengths, is fitted with an analytic model including a constant component for the underlying persistent emission, plus a power law describing the excess ( afterglow ) emission. as can be seen from the top panel of figure [ decay ], an index of 0.89@xmath00.06 provides a reasonably good description of the decay trend. however, on the bottom of the general decay trend, the light curve shows an intrinsic bump - like feature, reaching a point of gradual decline 3 - 4 years after the burst. the attempt to characterize the spectral evolution of the source using the spectral analysis carried out using the instrumental method brought out by ulysses and grbm fails, in part, at least, to a half of the energy of the original pulsed radiation. the interpretation of this particular event, bringing to light an ` ` unusual '', pulsed - radiation - related spectral trend, is therefore highly uncertain.
we describe a procedure for extracting a statistically well defined catalogue of putative galaxy clusters from the cronario all - sky survey. the first step is the identification of cluster candidates through plate astrometry. this procedure requires the removal of all the spurious objects produced by extended, saturated objects on the plates ( which locally make the detection extremely unreliable ) and subsequently, the procedure performs the matching of the catalogues of the same sky region obtained in the three bands. this matches the objects in one filter with the nearest objects in the other two filters. although the number of matches is proportional to the instrumental magnitude, a significative fraction of objects ( too faint to be detected in some among the three filters ) is lost in the matching process and many objects have discordant s / n ratios in the different filters. we discuss how this problem can be reduced by adopting a new training set for the classification of galaxies. # 1 2_2h@xmath0 2_h^2 # 1.#2#3#4 # 1, _ # 2 _, # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1#2#1#2 # 3 _ # 4 _ # 5^#1_d # 1 # 2 -0.55em.0 22 -23.75em0 - 0 -1.35em0 # 1,#2,#3, # 4 # 1figure [ # 1 ] # 1 = = by -2 -inch plus 2 -12pt minus 2 # 1to 0pt#1 = cmbx10 scaled 2 to * desy-09 - 0 * + july 2009 + * discovery of galaxy clusters in the cbonari sky survey * + all the previously known abell, zwicky or x - ray clusters are recovered and many new candidates are detected. + a simple, but well understood and model independent, procedure for cleaning catalogues from spurious sources has been applied. the procedure was applied to the poss - ii field n. 610 ( @xmath1 centered at ra = 1h ) and re - evaluated the cluster density function ( lf ) as obtained by dalton et al.

we present a _ feasible _ experimental set - up for protein translocation. our study makes use of recent developments in the reconstruction of short polypeptides from _ in vitro _ experiments, and makes assumptions which are crucial for its accuracy. we show that our reconstruction method is robust and feasible even for substrates with a small number of independent cleavage centers. the study of proteasome translocation is very important from both the experimental and theoretical point of view. indeed, proteins are the building blocks of a ` ` living cell '' and a central issue in any research area. understanding how the proteins are degraded and transformed into other proteins is a fundamental aspect of any model of life. in particular, understanding how a protein is integrated in the larger organism has many potential applications. in systems which deal with many independent ( or overlapping ) components ( e.g. the genome, the host cell ) has particular advantages. for example, by knowing the sequence of the individual amino - acids ( _ etc. _ ) it is possible to determine the energy, temperature and path length of the protein with high precision. on the other hand, a general understanding of how a particular protein is degraded or distorted may lead to more or less incorrect estimates of its degradation rate and its path length. thus, it is crucial to know the details of the process of protein degradation. there are several approaches to realize protein degradation _ in situ _. in the first case, purified proteins are released into the environment. subsequently, part of the surviving protein is translocated by enzymes such as osmo or chaperones. from this process one may have a purified protein or a degraded protein, yet at the same time. in this case the degradation process is not directly observable. so, one has to rely on the information obtained by experiments. unfortunately, the available experimental tools are not sufficient for this purpose and the need is to be improved. this is the case with most of the polyglycine ( pgl ), one of the most simple and most well - understood peptides ( see @xcite ). of course we do not know how the pgl is degraded and how it is integrated into the organism. we only know that the experimental technique used is very sensitive to measurement inaccuracy and may require more sophisticated and sophisticated approaches to reconstruct the polygl. moreover, because of the above assumptions, very little is known about how the degradation of a particular peptide is actually performed in real life and how the experimental results are affected by the inaccuracy. here we propose
we present spectral line radiative transfer observations of the protostellar candidates ngc1333iras2 and serpens smm4, obtained with the @xmath0-iteration method. the observations are made in the spectral line of hco@xmath1, and in the lines of cs and cs. we use the data to test the modelling ability of the code. line profiles of density, kinetic temperature, molecule abundance, systematic velocity and micro - turbulent velocity dispersion are selected and compared to the predictions of the model. for a spherically symmetric model cloud, we find that there exists a steady state solution for the distribution of rotational energy level populations as a function of position in the cloud, which agrees well with the observed line profiles. this result suggests that the integration of the equation of transfer along the line of sight is being carried out correctly. compared with previous non - lte studies this is becoming one of the principal sources of uncertainty in the modelling of infall line profiles, due to the fact that well separated parts of the cloud can interact radiatively with each other. turbulence is complicating the line profile modelling process and impeding the convergence of the level populations. we investigate the qualitative dependence of the predicted line profiles on the model parameters : the infall velocity, the effective sound speed, the infall radius, the chemical composition, the velocity width and the degree of turbulentity. in general, model predictions are more consistent with the observations than with the previous studies. however, a better fit to the data requires the model predictions to be shallower than the singular isothermal sphere model, and to have the line profiles with greater frequency. in this regard, the development of a fully developed gravitational core is required. we also find that a more complex model is needed in order to produce a reliable profile for the asymmetry between the optical depths of the line peaks. we conclude that modelling the observations adequately is necessary for a reliable description of the dynamics of the infall phase in circumstellar envelopes. # 1to 0pt#1 ism : jets and outflows stars : formation stars : low - mass stars : winds, outflows
we report the results of a large suite of numerical simulations designed to study the evolution of live low - mass protoplanets. the simulations are run with gasoline, a parallel tree - based gravity code with sph hydrodynamics that uses multistepping to evolve efficiently a wide density range ( from @xmath0 to just about one jupiter mass ). we evolve systems that are either locally isothermal or with an adiabatic equation of state. in all runs compression and heating are switched off before a density threshold is reached somewhere. we then heat the inner part of the disk by means of another radially dependent term, so that a gravitationally stable disk is used to counteract heating from strong compressions and shocks along the spiral arms. for runs that include radiative cooling we find that, despite the higher mass of the protoplanet, overdense regions always grow too rapidly and reach fragmentation. the size of the clump that form is proportional to the local jeans mass and it is strongly inhibited below this mass. for the same value of mass our results are in very good agreement with those of rice et al. ( 2003a, 2003b ). the latter confirms that the formation of massive, geometrically thin disks is a very robust process ( their number and sizes grow with mass ) despite the considerable effort put into cooling by the central star. disks that undergo fragmentation show few clumps, while only a few survive in the final run. the models that do not form any clumps show a much larger number of spirals ( up to 10 ), so it is likely that the instability is weak and that the magnetic fields are strong enough to support the existence of the spirals.

we have undertaken a large multi - j co and hcn line survey of local luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and two local agn with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ), as part of our large program to obtain a self - consistent inventory of the high - excitation molecular gas content of galaxies across the universe, and to study the effect of the dominant active galactic nucleus ( agn ) on such systems. high - quality multi - component spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of the rotational transitions of molecular species such as co, hcn, hco@xmath0k, and co j=65 ( 691.473ghz ) have been obtained for these regions of late - type galaxies and high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) radio galaxies, using the very large array ( vla ) and/or the subaru 8.2 m telescope ( soar ), with 10-m and 100-m telescopes. the range of excitation conditions accessible to our survey is thereby spanning the entire range of molecular gas physical conditions accessible in high redshift quasars, from very low to high excitation states. the availability of high - j line luminosities allows an inventory of _ all _ the co - rich molecular gas phases of their hosts, irrespective of their average excitation state, and thus provides a prerequisite if the fraction of the star - forming dense and warm molecular gas is to be determined. from this sample we find : i ) * significant dust optical depths in some of the highest excitation co sleds in our survey galaxies, namely arp220 and mrk231, imply that significant amounts of cold dust is present in systems such as these, even in systems undergoing intense dust - enshrouded starbursts, which in the past had been thought to be extreme relic galaxies. ii ) the depletion of highly - excited co lines in the warm phase of highly optically luminous ulirgs / qsbs suggests that cold dust may be an important factor in producing most of the significant starburst - like molecular gas emission, and that significant [ cii ] emission may be suppressed in systems with high optical depth. this is in particular the case of the radio galaxy 3c293, which has recently been shown to be dominated by a starburst, and is thus one of the few examples of a galaxy whose molecular gas reservoir is well - mixed with a concomitant isothermal warm and dense gas phase. we further demonstrate that
in this paper, we introduce a new representation of a coding sequence of a simple undirected graph with @xmath0 vertices in terms of certain vectors in the vector space over @xday0. we call it the incidence matrix and we show that it provides a natural submatrix for the class of graph coding sequences that are acyclic, connected, bipartite, eulerian or hamiltonian. as an application, we obtain a new characterization of a class of segment binary matroids which correspond to adsorption matrices for graph theory and linear algebra. in his pioneering paper on obscuration matrices, whitney defined the notion of incidence matrix for round tables. by definition, a matrix is said to be a " matrix if it is a combination of a ( non - strict ) matrix ( i.e., non - null vector ) with an edge in each row, every column and every row and column in the sequence of offsets from the end point of one of these matrices with exactly two ones in each column. in the beginning, whiteley d. deffuant and sofoiu raised the notion that incidence matrices are representations of matrices because any graph having a sufficiently large number of vertices can be represented by such a matrix. gradually whitney improved on this line of thought and in the later part of the 20th century, also considerable effort was devoted to characterize other representations, which were based on matrices. in contrast to the earlier ones, such a characterization was not possible until after the deep and systematic work of w. p. tutte. however, after the work of tutte, attempts were made to characterize general matroid representations, and even a characterization of graphic matroid were halted. in fact, it is still not completely clear what is the same for matroid representation as those for which it is known, e.g., whiteney assumed that the problem of characterizing linear graphs was essentially considered from a matroid point of view. the purpose of this paper is to provide a new characterization for this problem, with the hope that it will shed light on a long standing problem and contribute to our understanding of matroid theory.
we present a two step approach to calculate both magnetic and/or transport properties of a wide range of diluted magnetic semiconductors. the approach is based on the heisenberg hamiltonian that describes n@xmath0 interacting spins @xmath1 ( classical or quantum ) randomly distributed in the semiconductor host. first, the magnetic couplings are calculated within the self consistent local random phase approximation ( sc - lrpa ) that is described in the paper. then the transition to the metal - insulator ( i.e. metal - doped iii - v ) phase is described within the fully non - perturbative ( v - j ) model. in the second step the transition is treated perturbatively. an excellent quantitative agreement is found between the semi - analytical approximation and the experimental data. it is found that the highest curie temperature for mn doped gaas is zero and is located inside the unperturbed valence band. as for the case of ( ga, mn)as, the fermi level is located in the resonant impurity band and the anisotropic magnetization distribution is calculated exactly. the results are in good agreement with first principle based estimates and provide strong support to the so called ` ` impurity - band picture '' that has been proposed to describe the physics in this class of materials. in addition, our results also support the recently proposed idea that, in these materials, the existence of a sufficiently large concentration of mn ( beyond the critical concentration ) leads to the emergence of a higher - order magnetic field. lastly, we discuss the comparison between ab initio calculations and ( ii ) model based predictions and find that the resulting magnetic properties agree well with the experimental measurements. in particular, the slope of the magnetic susceptibility spectrum is found to be in excellent agreement with the slope obtained from first principle calculations and is consistent with the measurement. = 10000
the detector sensitive to neutrons is used in many underground experiments for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ). it is essential to ensure that the neutron flux from rock is negligible. measurements of the neutron background from such an experiment are difficult to make due to the finite energy resolution of the detector. we present a method to convert the gamma flux from boulby rock into a neutron flux using delayed coincidences of gamma - ray pulses and use this technique to evaluate the neutron detection efficiency of geant4, a new detector designed to study the detector sensitivity to recoils from highly energetic protons. the method was applied to the ` castle'detector at the boulbey underground laboratory and neutron flux measurements were carried out with a liquid scintillator, data aquisition system and a monte carlo simulation of neutron production. the results from these studies are presented. the detector size was about 5 metres, but the dead time of the apparatus was about 237 ms. an energy threshold of @xmath0 kev was set for the detector in order to suppress the background from other sources. the background is due to muon scattering on na in the rock, caused by the presence of a quasi - simultaneous 1.8 mev second pulse and a quenched second pulse from alphas. the experimental background is dominated by the delayed coincidence of two pulses, resulting in a peak in the flux of about 0.96 mev. this technique should be easily adapted for other locations in the detector and should be very sensitive to other sources, such as other types of detectors. an accuracy of about 50 % lower than current levels is required to calibrate the detector, so that background measurements with a low energy threshold do not give an unfavourable sample to compare with the present day level of uncertainty in the measured level of sensitivity. * measurements of neutron flux + from rock and its calibration * h. m. arajo@xmath1, c. a. garca - hauckstrm, t. g. grzegorczyk, b. j. tolhurst + _ dark matter cosmology and particle physics group, niels bohr institute, ch-1211 genve 23, switzerland _ + [ cols= " >, < ", ] + there are some uncertainties in the calculation of the energy threshold and the energy limit for neutrons, so these uncertainties are taken into account in the final results. we describe the method and the results of the experiment.
we present a study on the x - ray emission from a sample of high mass young stellar objects ( ysos ), based on the @xmath0 observation of the young stellar object ( yso ) candidate, ylw 16a, which is located in the field of the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) sgr b2. we find x - rays from class 0 stars ( class 0s ), protostars ( class is ), and young blown dwarfs ( bds ), most of which show high duty ratio and mid - ir excess emission. we detect 18 high mass class 0 sources in the gmcs, 2 in the class 1 oph molecular cloud, and 5 in the orion molecular cloud. the sources are detected in the _ xmm - newton _ band at a detection rate of 26 %. we describe the _ mm _ spectra with a thin thermal plasma model and find that the typical temperature and absorptions of class is are about 0.6 kev and 6.4 kev, respectively. the typical spectrum of irs1 sw and irs 2 ( also irs 3 ) is very absorbed and shows deep absorption features in the water - ice and silicate bands. all the high mass sources thus detected show rapid time variability and strong variability in the mid- to far - ir bands, which points to magnetic activity. we propose a working hypothesis for the evolution of is : the magnetic field is strong enough to produce a high temperature plasma above the temperature threshold in the stellar wind, which gradually declines until the stellar mass is about 1.2 %, at which point the field cools off. then the magnetic energy is radiated away by the released energy, and the only remaining source is the low mass bd. this scenario is basically similar to that found for low mass stars, where low mass companions may be ejected from the hii region and/or placed at the center of the cloud. this explanation is supported by the quasi - static 6.7 kev line emission of he - like irons in the circumstellar gas of class 0 and is, which indicates that class is in a similar phase of activity as those of class iis and iiis.
we establish certain properties of integrable maxwell - scalar field systems under spherical symmetry, which yield information about the wave equation and the associated equations of motion. this paper is the application of the results of @xcite, who established conditions on a dyadic subinterval of the event horizon to yield the lower bound on the product of the einstein - maxwell equations in null coordinates, where @xmath0 is the standard metric on the standard spacetime. these conditions are then applied to find solutions whose evolution is described by the solutions specified above. we consider two initial geometries, namely, the initial ingoing null curve and the timelike boundary. in the first, we establish conditions on the evolution of the metric to be nonincreasing to the future, while in the second we require that the evolution is not constant along the horizon. under these assumptions, we obtain the following lower bounds. _ the integrate - and - integrate theorem on the value of the maxwell part of the energy - momentum tensor in a lorentzian metric is established. _ proof of this result follows from proposition 1. the real determinant of the integration, namely the sign of the integral over the metric, is also known as the schrdinger equation, and was derived independently by d. sullivan in his work about the relation between the real - metric tangent fields and the metric coefficent fields, _ i.e. _, without reference to the metric - coordinate subsystems of the scalar fields. for this reason, it has been known for quite some time that d.ss. does not agree with me over all the volume in the ( large ) reservoir of maxwell s equations. [ cols="^,<,^",options="header ", ] although this was originally believed to be the case, recent numerical calculations have shown that this is not the case at all. note that the same construction applies in the case where the metric is infinite, and in the more general case where maxwell and einstein are coupled via a feedback loop. the situation where the two equations are no longer coupled is of a more general interest. the aim of the present paper is to confirm this basic result, in the form of an alternative lower bound, which we will prove to be equal to the first lower bound.
the interaction of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) with geomagnetic ejecta or magnetospheric flows is one of the main mechanisms for current and energy release from cmes. as the largest explosive phenomenon on the sun, cmes can also drive powerful solar - like eruptions. the potential for cme - cme interaction has been studied extensively since the first discovery by. observations show a large increase in the number of such events occurring on 1997 february 23, when a cme erupted from the north - east limb of the sun. it is now known that the cme carries a large amount of energy and magnetic flux. based on the current knowledge, the possible mechanisms of one cme triggering another include ( 1 ) destabilization of magnetic structures during the eruption and the post - eruption phases, and ( 2 ) the continuous emergence of flux / helicity from the lower atmosphere. however, statistical studies have suggested that homologous / sympathetic cmes only correspond to a small fraction of the total cmes, meaning that not all of them can trigger subsequent eruptions and that the majority of cmes do not interact too closely. moreover, it has been found that the types of radio bursts observed ( type iii and type i ) for cmes are likely to be a result of the magnetic restructuring in cmes induced by the interaction, rather than due to mirroring effects. we review the physical phenomena and concepts associated with the initiation and interaction of successive cmes including their effects on particle acceleration and their potential for strong driving of earth s magnetosphere. we discuss what to expect in the upcoming decade with new observations provided by solar probe+ and solar orbiter and conclude that the combination of observations, theory and simulations will enable us to have a better handle on the processes that lead to the release of energy, magnetic flux and particle acceleration in the solar atmosphere. there will be many surprises in the near future, especially with respect to previously reported detections of so - called _ in situ _ cmes and sep events.
we determine the luminosity function @xmath0 of quasars from various optically and x - ray selected surveys. we use four samples with relatively similar selection criteria and use the lynden - bell s idea of using integrated luminosity functions to determine the functional form of the observed luminosity evolution ( or density evolution ). the four samples are the original radio selected quasar samples, 3c ( schmidt 1963 ), 4c ( lynds and wills 1972 ), large bright qso survey ( lbqs ) and the hbqs 4c redshift range ( hewett et al. 1998 ). using non - parametric methods for testing the correlation between the luminosities and redshifts ( or fluxes ) of the sources, we compare the results from these four samples and find a general trend of _ rise _ and _ decline _ in the relationship with redshift. the results are in good agreement with the behavior of the star formation rate ( sfr ), which has recently been extended to high redshift, if one assumes that the rate of accretion onto the central black hole is constant. however, quasar evolution can not be solely based on the sfr, unless there is a new mechanism for the formation of massive black holes that is independent of the cosmological parameters. alternatively, one can use the evolution of the accretion rate to constrain the growth of the black hole population. the present truncated data ( with upper limit on the flux from a putative agn and a range of alternative sources ) are not well suited to doing this, in two different respects. first, the flux limited samples have been treated with truncated samples and are thus subject to biases such as those introduced by the use of a flux limited subsample. second, the quasar sfr is not known exactly and the effect of sfr truncation has not been properly taken into account. in this paper we examine these issues and find the following : _ we do not observe a hubble - type relation in the ml - r - l@xmath1 diagram. there is no clear evidence for the possible existence of such a relation up to very high red shifts. _ the total - luminosity and eddington - limit magnitude distributions of the lbqs do not show any correlation with the host galaxy properties. this may be caused by a differential accretion as more luminous sources are accreted. _ we examine the consistency of the above results with predictions of the standard model for the evolution
the unique inhomogenous magnetic state of the rare - earth manganite @xmath0-namno@xmath1-nam no - nakagawa - nielsen - das sarma - terlevich is supported by high - resolution synchrotron x - ray diffraction measurements in the electron magnetically ordered state. this state is attributed to a magnetostructural inhomogeneity of the local magnetic field distribution that is tightly bound to the atomic lattice symmetry. it is shown to be a novel paradigm for phase - separated magnetic states of correlated electron systems, and that it is associated with the geometrical frustration of the underlying spin lattice. the exact mechanism is discussed based on _ ab initio _ calculations of the two - dimensional dipolar fields from antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic moments. the large elastic moduli of the finite - size disorder are consistent with the inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic excitations that we infer from the rietveld and haadf - stem x - stem diagnostics. further, we demonstrate that the disorder - free, nearly - isothermal intermolecular interactions on a triangular charge - cluster lattice lead to the formation of anisotropic bragg reflections that are energetically favoured by the data. this provides a solid foundation for the realization of a multiple - minima free - energy landscape of electrons on frustrated lattices. the concept of electronic - charge inhomogeneities in this class of materials was first introduced @xcite and has since been extended to various superconducting cuprates, colossal magnetoresistant manganites and other chemically homogenous systems. the unique states of high - temperature magnetism in these systems are supported by large elastic and magnetic - field excitations, stemming from the competition of nonmagnetic and magnetic exchange interactions. during the last two decades, this phenomenon has been intensively explored both theoretically and experimentally, yielding important insights into the mechanisms responsible for the unusual behaviour of their electronic properties. it has been shown that the mutual cancellation of the competing exchange and magnetic energies on a nearly - degenerate triangular - charge lattice is a key ingredient in the emergence of highly correlated electronic states. as a result, frustration on the electronic lattice has been identified as the origin of the significant quantum fluctuations that are observed in this highly correlated material. although the related energetic excitations have been studied in a number of systems, only a few have been directly observed in an experimentally relevant system with a near - degener
this paper in the series explores the central stellar populations of local elliptical galaxies and develops correlations among them and with parent - galaxy structural parameters. the correlations are based on the lick / ids line - strength system, on the models used to transform stellar population parameters into ssp - equivalent parameters, and on environmental effects. the present sample spans a wide range of ages, most notably in field ellipticals. this two - dimensional ` ` metallicity hyperplane, '', which we call the ` ` @xmath6-plane '', shows clearly how environmental effects affect the appearance of scaling laws, both parameter - related and parameter - dependent, depending on the distribution of galaxies in the sample. principal component analysis demonstrates that the present data can be largely specified using just two independent variables ; these to be the single - stellar - population age ( age ) and the velocity dispersion ( velocity ). the hyperplane in turn appears to be in place at the present time and is shown to be associated mainly with the intrinsic scatter in the parameters. we can not, however, rule out the possibility that the populations are old with a ` ` frosting '' extending to younger ages. the sample shows a possible difference of ssp ages with environment our results are in agreement with the suggestion that the virgo cluster is the single most important environment for ellipticals the so - called ` ` dark side '' of the universe. also, we find that there is likely to be a significant spread in the ages of the populations, while the fornax cluster appears generally older. our results favor an ` ` old '' scenario in which type ii supernovae ( sne ) are favored at high mass and have a high yield at a fixed age. the location of the frosting at the edge of the galaxy is also consistent with this scenario. we find significant differences in the projected scaling laws between field and virgo ellipticals, which in turn may be explained by different initial conditions.
we apply two - dimensional radiative transfer models to analyze the multi - wavelength spectrum of eta car, from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the near - infrared ( nir ), in order to constrain the orbital parameters of the binary system. we find that the presence of a wide - field - of - sight ( wwc ) cavity in the stellar wind induces not only latitudinal and azimuthal dependence in the continuum and line profiles, but also variations in the p - cygni absorption components of low - ionization uv resonance lines. the 2-d models provide a much better description of the uv spectrum than the 1-d spherical cmfgen code. we investigate in detail the effects of the cavity on spectral lines, showing that two factors dominate the influence : the size of the line formation region compared to the distance of the wc cavity from the line apex, and the orientation of thewc cavity with respect to the observer. for our preferred orbital orientation, @xmath0 becomes weak or absent in the optical spectrum when the cavity is low - density, and strong absorption of fe@xmath1 emission lines becomes significant when high - density material is present in the cavity. on the contrary, and because the spectral lines formed in an expanding outflow, different velocity regions of a spectral line form at different spatial regions. by changing the wind terminal velocity, as a function of the orbital inclination angle, we are able to remove the degeneracy between the wind inclination angle and the half - opening angle, which is the key parameter in 3-d hydrodynamical simulations. the results of our modeling indicate that spectral lines are significantly affected by the wrc cavity even during the apastron observations. in particular, the continuum emission lines, which form in the outflow ejecta, are significantly distorted by the cavity, with the continuum shifted to higher latitudes and stronger absorption components at higher optical depths. we discuss how these results may impact the determination of the mass of the primary star in this binary.
we perform a systematic analysis of the @xmath0 decay, taking the most recent measurements by the babar and belle experiments into account. in these quantities, we observe that the standard model prediction ( on the right - hand side ) is very stable in time, having now significantly reduced errors. the following results can be obtained with the help of the isospin symmetry : ( i ) we obtain a new value for the ratio of the penguin to tree amplitudes of the 0.1@xmath1 decay, which is in good agreement with the sm fits of the unitarity triangle ; ( ii ) we find that the average values of the cp - violating asymmetries of the neutral and re - scattered decay processes are well reproduced by our simulations, and hence, provide a new probe for cp - violation in these modes. assuming that there are no differences in the topologies of the electroweak penguins and the corresponding tree and penguin diagrams in the sm, we obtain the following values for the average ratios of the mixing - induced cp asymmetry to the tree - to - mixing asymmetry ; ( iii ) we give the experimental averages which indicate a good agreement between the current data and the sm predictions ; ( iv ) we show that the direct measurement of cp violation offers an exciting new insight into the physics of these modes, raising also the question whether new - physics contributions can be extracted from the data. cern - ph - th/2005 - 241 + tum - hep-610/05 + mpp-2005 - 156 + hep - ph/0512032 * andrzeja korolkova * * in association with the batchelor institute of theoretical physics * * pacs numbers : * 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba, 14.80.pq * and * z. xu * * keywords : * heavy quark, cp violation, new physics * i. introduction * one of the most important results from the experimental domain that can be directly compared with the theory is the recent observation at the cern kobayashi maskawa collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhcb ), in collaboration with k. dziedzic, a. karev, w. krolikowski and m. palestini * _ ( a ) submitted to physics letters b _ + the following are shown in fig.

the quasi - chemical approach to solution chemistry is an extended in its treatment of statistical thermodynamics of aqueous solutions. the core ideas are that a handful of proximal water molecules are responsible for determining the thermodynamic characteristics of the innermost regions of the solution, essentially as ligands of the macromolecule of interest, and that these molecules should be explicitly included as inner hydration shell ligands in all statistical thermodynamic calculations. a thermodynamic model for the hydration of the li@xmath0 ion is presented, which permits a concise derivation of the basic physical structure of the theory. the derivation relies on the gravitational theory of guggenheim, bethe, and kikuchi and relies on a clustering analysis that properly neglects the effects of the more distant medium. it also requires the inclusion of a simple implicit solvent model that represents the ` chemical'reaction for isolated reaction species rather than a dielectric continuum model. these two implicit solvent models are shown to produce nearly identical results even when the number of explicitly included solvent molecules is reduced to a realistically small number. the most intriguing result is that the implicit solvation free energy predictions based upon the use of explicit solvent molecules for the calculation of temperature, pressure, and chemical composition are accurate. this is in contrast to the nearly optimal solution thermodynamics adopted in other implicit solvent approaches that systematically ignore the fact that a finite number of molecules other than the solute are involved. the new approach exhibits a sensitivity to the number and chemical nature of the ligands. a.l. b. zhang, g. li, s. r. smith, and j. p. hughes, phys. rev. e * 81 *, 094406 ( 2010 ) + @xmath1laboratory for materials science, university of michigan, ann arbor, mi 48109 - 1040, usa. * advanced studies of solution chemistry * * 52*(1 ), 687 ( 2011 ) * hydration, structure, and numerical analysis of a quaternary ion in solution * 1*(2 ), 33rd joint institute for nuclear studies, department of physics, graduate school of science, saitama university, shimo - okubo, tokyo 186 - 8588, japan * ( submitted to physics reports ) *
in this contribution we study the scaling behavior of the distributional properties of price increments and their correlation structure under a change of time scale. the data has been taken on a high frequency data set of s&p futures prices between october 1991 and september 1995. the sum of the variances of the steps @xmath0 is assumed to be the logarithm of the changes in the price. assuming no scale invariance, the distribution of the increments exhibits a scaling behavior different from that of a _ scale invariant random walk _ : its variance is linear with respect to the time scale, exhibiting persistence in the scale of the fluctuations, and its autocorrelation function decays slowly to zero in a few minutes. in addition, the kurtosis of the variance is found to exhibit a non - linear increase with the change of timescale, which can be represented by a power law. without further adiabatic corrections, the exponent of the correlation function decreases monotonically with time. these results are consistent with the absence of scale dependent serial correlations in the increments, and indicate that independent increments are indistinguishable from a _ lvy flight_. d.bolmatov@gmail.com * keywords : * + price increments, return dynamics, time series, stochastic process. * msc : * 60h10, 60h40, 91125. * nele goeyvaerts@bnl.gov * + _ pacs number(s ) :} 02.50.-a, 03.65.ud, 91.75.-y, 02.75.df * abstract * _ _ * where are the results and what is the purpose of this contribution? _ + we have conducted a comprehensive study on the properties of the price changes in liquid markets over the recent years. our results are discussed in the context of the ` ` efficient market hypothesis '', suggesting that a time series with independent price changes can be representative of the market dynamics on a time scale independent from the others. the idea behind this study has been to compare the distributions of price changes at various time scales, to gain insight into the dependence structure of the time series. this has been motivated by the recent finding by mandelbrot @xcite that the signs of price movements at very short time resolutions ( less than a minute ) are significantly correlated, they can be safely considered as independent ( as far as the sign test is concerned ) for time scales beyond 30 minutes. this criterion indicates a simple non - parametric
in this paper we study the effect of introduction of boundary slip in the theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous solid. the theory, originally formulated by biot, is valid for low frequencies as well as high frequencies. the classical no - slip case is replaced by two non - biot attenuation mechanisms : local flow in micro - cracks along grain contacts, and attenuation from pore - wall surface roughness. the model system based on these two mechanisms seemed to succeed in improvement of fitting the data. however, this by no means does not exclude other possibilities, and all plausible effects that could explain the discrepancy should be explored. at low frequencies, the fluid flow is of poiseuille type and the inertia effects are obviously negligible in comparison with the effects of the viscosity. at high frequencies, however, these effects are confined to a thin boundary layer in the vicinity of the pore walls and they are dominant. therefore, we conjecture that in such situations, apart from other yet unknown effects, non - zero boundary slip effect may be responsible for the deviations between the predicted and the experimental results. we also study the full parameter space of the problem. in all forthcoming results, we calculated normalized phase velocity of the plane rotational waves, and the attenuation coefficients of both types of the dilatational waves ( @xmath0 ) in the domain of intermediate frequencies. we find that the introduction of the non - 0 boundary slip into the biot s theory of penguins elastic waves results in _ decrease _ of the phase velocities of both rotational and ( first kind ) dilatations. on the contrary, the phase velocityof the second kind is _ increased _ as compared to the no - boundary slip limiting case, which is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. we suggest that such type of behavior of the elastic waves could be relevant in the exploration of oil field resonances in natural porous rocks. pacs number : 73.20.mf ; exp. number : 02.65.ud ; 71.10.ly
we investigate the role of shock dissipation on the dynamics and emission of impulsive poynting - dominated relativistic jets. for this purpose, we use as a first step the numerical simulation of a model of a train of highly magnetized plasma shells, moving in the same direction but initially isolated by empty space, as described previously by liu et al. ( 2007 ). the main conclusions of our study are : ( 1 ) the dissipation efficiency of strong shocks is generally low, @xmath0, mainly because only the kinetic energy dissipates and it represents only a small fraction of the total energy flowing through the shock. however, the amount of energy eventually converted into non - thermal emission depends on the maximum degree of magnetic flux freezing during the transition from the thermal to the wave - free final state. the radiative cooling allows to maximise the released magnetic energy. for radially diverging flows, the adiabatic cooling is expected to do the same. ( 2 ) the dynamics of a moving train with gaps filled with weakly magnetised plasma from the start may be different from that of an isolated shell. in this case the prompt emission of the externally excited plasma ( the so - called external shock ) may remain quite difficult to identify with the flow, even though the magnetization of the plasma is much lower in the case of grbs. ( 3 ) if the jet engine does indeed operate in an impulsive fashion, the flow magnetization determines the characteristic length scale of the quiescent period and the characteristic amount of the external shock. in particular examples of such prompt emission events remain to be studied. ( 4 ) it is difficult to quantify the energy released by the shock in a jet because the released energy is not accounted for in the usual energy release accounts for both for the prompt loading of the jet and the unradiated energy returning to the plasma. ( 5 ) for a train consisting of many individual magnetic shells each with their initial magnetization much lower than the others, the energy dissipation with time - scale as large as a few times the thermal deflection of electrons is required to achieve a high level of efficiency. ( 6 ) even if we ignore the entrainment of surrounding plasma, the strong shock interaction between heads and tails of magnetic shells, revealed in the present study, is already sufficient to prevent the conversion of almost all available magnetic energy into kinetic energy shell heads. thus, the jet acceleration and collimation go hand - in - hand and for this reason this version of magnetic mechanism
we present a study of the cabibbo - kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements from @xmath0 decays using data recorded by the opal detector at lep. using dilepton events in data collected between 1991 and 1993, we find the lower limit on the ckm matrix element fraction for the rate of b meson oscillations @xcite. we have also studied the sensitivity of the results to systematic errors including measurement of the proper time scale and the charge combination of the two leptons. the results are compared with previously published data and are found to be consistent with the standard model expectation. plus 1pt minus 1pt european laboratory for particle physics cern - ep/98 - 194 + november 23, 1998 * measurement of cabiboo - kabayashi - maskawa matrix elements using hadronic oscillations at lhc * the opals collaboration + submitted to eur.phys.j.c _ c.s. f.d. aaron@xmath1, m.a. alexa@xcite, k. alimujiang@qc.ac.kc@tcd.ch the cdf collaboration has presented data on the decay of the neutral b mesons produced in the collisions of heavy nuclei inside the proton - antiproton collision, as part of its efforts to understand the non - standard model and understand the nucleon structure and dynamics of the strong interaction. these studies have been performed using a variety of techniques and the data is presented here as a complete set of data sets, of which some of the data have been simulated for the first time. by combining the data with standard models of particle physics, including cp violation, a priori, we obtain a likelihood curve that is free of systematic uncertainties. using this likelihood curve, we have measured the difference in log - likelihood from the maximum ( 95 % c.l. ) with respect to the corresponding value at the preferred value in the data. the difference has been measured at both the 95 % confidence level as well as at a preferred value for the actual value of the mixing angle between the meson mass eigenstates. this study has been carried out for two different values of the top quark mass and meson proper time. in a previous paper, we had measured the dependence of the likelihood curve on the first two meson decay constants using a maximum likelihood technique. in this work, we extract the results of this study using data
using the cleo ii detector, we have measured the differential and total branching ratios for the @xmath0 decay of the charm and strange quarks to the semileptonic final state and to the hyperon - antinucleon final state. we also study the shape and relative size of the combinatorial background and the areas of this background in the measured hadron decay modes, using the branching fractions measured in our own experiment and in the data sample analyzed. we find that the measured shapes and relative sizes of the backgrounds are qualitatively different from those seen in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) analysis. we have also studied the selection criteria and general procedures used to analyze the data. the general results are in good agreement with the results of the single parameter analysis of the generic monte carlo simulation. we report a 1 % uncertainty in the detection efficiencies of the three charged track modes, but we find an improvement of the overall statistical error on the determination of the differential spectra due to the application of the generalized mc - tag procedure. we estimate the sensitivity of the 3d - structure parameter to the choice of the scale factor and the amount of background events. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 065 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2010 + * measurement of inclusive and global hadronic * branching ratios and momentum spectra for the decay of charm * + + + _ submitted to eur. phys. j. _ c. f.d. aaron@xmath1, m. aldous- alessandroandroff@xcite, v. batley, c. bevan, t. bernreuther, r.s. berthelot, s.behnke, a.n. weinberg, p. kwak, d.j. munday, + m. patel, + a.w. wotton + _ cavendish laboratory, university of cambridge, cambridge cb3 0he, u.k. _ + r. arcidiacono, g. bocquet, n. boettcher, a.- m. boersma, j. bracinik, f. boudry, w. bradamant, r.- d. biebel, p.- p. bienstman, and r.
we explore the geometry of a brane - world geometry in which the top quark masses and large mixing angles are determined by a single planck brane in the extra dimension. we find that this brane geometry is consistent with the orginal five - dimensional randall - sundrum brane theory. we derive effective mass eigenvalues for the fermion mass term and use them to taming the gauge hierarchy problem. we show that the hierarchical mass hierarchy is generated by the combination of an effective nonzero higgs profile in the bulk and branes localized on other branes, and that the masses of the right - handed and left - handed fermions are unified by an effective four dimensional feynman - quark mass term that depends only on the energy scale of the brane. we also investigate the connection between location and mass scale for these branes. # 1#2#3_nucl. phys. _ * b#1 *, # 2 ( 19#3)#1 # 2 # 3 phys. lett. b * # 1 *, l#2(#3 ) # 3 # 1 = cmss10 = cmr10 = cmbx10 scaled 1 to 0pt#1 s-6pt/ h-7.5pt/ # 1 extra - dimensions wu b://nts.utk.edu/@xmath0wustl.html _ + [ cols= " < ", ] ( presented by * m. zeilinger, m. v. g. thompson, s. kotov, p. majewski, and u. majumdar ) _ + @xmath1laboratoire de physique thorique + universit de paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex, france _ + * contents * 1. introduction 1. general outlook 2. branes 3. dynamical systems in extra dimensions 3. kinematics and dynamics 4. flavor ordering in the five dimensional brane world 5. hierarchy of neutrino masses 6. the color glass condensate in the eighties and seventies 7. localization of the graviton on a hidden brane 8. a partonic matter on multiple branes 9. dirac confinement on a single brane 10. _ theorem _ 10. lower bounds on the values of the dirac algebra in five dimensions as seen in curved space _ + _ key words _ : brane
we compare different system and network level simulators recently introduced to study the impact of network conditions on the performance of wireless communication networks. the main criteria for this comparison include the choice of the programming language used ( for which a comparative analysis is possible ), the level of abstraction of the simulators, the minimum number of links needed to simulate a wide range of scenarios, the kind of choice of simulators for different scenarios, and the in - house - built simulator for simulators. we consider a representative set of commonly used global scale simulators ( from protocol - agnostic to network - level implementation ). we compare how well these simulators perform in terms of the trade - offs between the required technical features in implementation, such as c++ usage, ease - of - use, automatic memory management, network flexibility, and user - centricity. in addition, we assess the suitability of the different simulators regarding their suitability to different scenarios. for the case of hetdensim, we find that simulators are particularly suitable for applications that require a high degree of accuracy in the assessment of coverage, spectral efficiency, and throughput in wireless networks, taking into account interference generated by neighbouring or. simulators can also be used to investigate how and interference coordination techniques perform and how potential solutions scale with the size of the network. mobile networks, hetnet, wireless network, interference suppression, network simulation * [ section ] [ columbia university, new york, ny 10027, usa ] + @xmath0e - mail :columbia@sas.umd.edu.uk + mobile networks have gradually evolved towards ever - increasing data traffic densities. although the number of base stations and base stations used to communicate with each other has increased dramatically, the average number of users per base station has tended to decrease over the past few years. this is due to the growing base station capacity, as more and more users are connected to the core network through increasingly high - throughput backhaul technologies such as point - to - point links, fiber links, microwave relays, and multi - antenna base stations. consequently, due to these challenges, researchers, equipment vendors, and network operators are focusing on solutions that are both flexible and cost - effective. as the network topology gradually evolves toward more numerous, heterogeneous deployment of nodes, interference becomes a critical issue. therefore, simulation is an essential tool for investigating potential solutions to this problem. + @xcite
we develop a framework for understanding the demographics of star clusters, along with a toy model for the antennae galaxies. the model builds on the mass and luminosity distributions of young clusters found in previous work, and incorporates a universal initial power law mass function, several disruption mechanisms, and a convolution with artifacts and selection effects. as a by - product we show that the correlation between the brightest young cluster ( i.e., m@xmath0(brightest ) vs. log(n ) ) can be understood as a statistical size - of - sample effect rather than a difference in the physical process responsible for the formation of the clusters. a wide variety of observations can be explained by this simple model. in particular, we concentrate on the comparison with observations of the antennase galaxies, and find agreement between the model and observations at the @xmath1 2-10 gyr level. the toy model includes a constant - formation part which results from the disruption of clusters in the infant mortality disruption process, and additional gaussian components that result from the continued expansion of the universe ( e.g., during the ` ` pre - main sequence '' phase ). to test the model, we compare its predictions with detailed information about the formation histories of cluster populations in the two antennae spiral galaxies ( a ) the radio galaxies ( b ) the chandar & whitmore ( 2006 ), and ( c ) the ring galaxy ngc 7252 ( ngc 7319 ). in the models and in the simulation, the brightest clusters are roughly distributed according to a power law with an index of 1.2, in good agreement with previous work. the characteristic mass and age of the brightest cluster can then be predicted by the slope of the luminosity and mass functions of old globular clusters. while the model shows no evidence for the end of cluster formation at an age comparable to or greater than 10 myr, it is consistent with the hypothesis that the formation epoch of the most massive clusters is significantly earlier than that of quiescent spirals. other properties of the cluster system are also discussed, in particular the fraction of intermediate - age stars in clusters, the presence of field stars beyond the critical mass limit, and the lack of an apparent upturn in the characteristic ages of clusters between 1 and 2.5 myr.
we present results from numerical simulations of off - center helium- and carbon - flash convection in two and three dimensions ( 2d and 3d ), respectively. these simulations include a detailed exploration of a mixing process that takes place below the temperature maximum immediately after convection starts. associated with the mixing is the redistribution of composition and entropy within the stable layers that reside beneath the shell convection zone. these layers form ` ` fingers '' of high mean molecular weight material which traverse the mixing region. these fingers are essentially tracer of material trasport taking place across the stable layer. the speed of mixing in these stable layers is comparable to the angular displacement speed across the unstable layer. we find that the mixing takes place against a background state which is initially stable, but as the convection rate increases and the background state disappears, the fingers trace the location of the unstable mixing region and the rate of mixing increases. this mixing process is not observed to operate below the burning shell in the oxygen burning case. we identify the new mixing process with a coupling between the kinetic energy of the convective shell and the layers which reside below it, a coupling which has potentially significant consequences for the star s structure and evolution. some salient features of the mixing process are not observed in the 3d simulations. the 2d model hefl.2d.1 contains small circular vortices which are unstable to thermohaline mixing on a dynamical timescale, and core helium flash simulations do not show significant temperature fluctuations. we discuss these results in the context of other processes commonly encountered in stellar interiors, including penetration and overshoot, semiconvection, and salt fingering.

we present high - precision si isotope measurements of 46 ocean island basalts ( oib ), including isotopically light si and o isotopes, for a suite of oib samples. the sample includes samples from the canary islands of el hierro and la palma, whose mantle sources have been interpreted to contain significant proportions of recycled oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle material. from the analysis of si isotopic variations in the oib suite, we find that the light si isotopes @xmath0 ^ 30^si and o are typically enriched in precipitated silica phases compared to the dissolved si in the fluid phase, which suggests that mantle - derived melts can be the source of the light nuclides without resorting to fractional crystallization or partial melting. a correlation between oib mantle composition and silica fractionation is observed in the literature, suggesting that the silica mass fraction in the plume source melts because recycled lithosphere material is preferentially comprised of particles that do not dissolve compared to ambient peridotite mantle. we assess the possible processes that may be responsible for causing the variations in oib silicate composition by considering four processes : post - eruptive alteration, metamorphic dehydration, sampling of a primitive mantle reservoir, crustal assimilation, and recycling of continental and oceanic surface materials. where possible, unaltered samples are chosen to minimize the effects of subduction on mantle input. in contrast to oceanic and continental crust, oceanic sediments have widely variable compositions and can be enriched in light si as compared to igneous rocks. this suggests that subduction may be one mechanism that is possible for generating the isotopic variability in the mantle. in addition, we also present evidence that primary crystallization is not the main mechanism responsible for the variation in the selenide - to oib composition, but rotational mixing and a fractional partial melting of the crustal material may play an important role. we discuss the implications of robust silicate surface materials characterization of the mantle sources for the characterization of possible mantle heterogeneities on a wide variety of mantle processes and infer that the sample sizes needed to verify the possible mantle recycling are achievable through medium - resolution spectroscopy.
the escape of a particle over a barrier, known as the kramers problem, is of great interest in biology as many biological processes involve the translocation of a chain molecule from one side of a membrane to the other, through a pore in the membrane. we consider a similar problem in the presence of a free energy difference between the two sides of the barrier, i.e., the kink, caused by the non - linearity of the rouse model. in this generalization of the problem, the chain molecule can be modelled as a string, moving in the @xmath0-direction with a kink in it, which is an equivalent to the motion of the center of mass of the molecule. this leads to a continuum theory for the dynamics of the chain, where the barrier is represented by an activation free energy surface ( energy landscape ). in the limit where the chain is very long, analogous to that for eukaryotic cells, the free energy landscape of activation is very similar to that of a single molecule, moving freely across a barrier. however, for short chains, the barriers are much thinner than for long chains, and the crossing process is much more diffusive. we calculate the crossing probability for the long chain in both cases, using the normal modes for fluctuations about this kink configuration, and find that for a relatively large chain, the probability of crossing is proportional to the number of segments in the chain. for example, for a polyglycine polymer, the crossing is suppressed with length, while in a cell the rate is enhanced with length. * keywords : * chain molecules, protein translocation, quantum tunneling, barrier crossing, free energy. * ams subject classifications : * 60f10, 60h05, 82c22, 82h23, 34e10, 34c26, 34j25, 34m25 * rsum : * particle motion through barrier, kinematics and dynamics, escape from a barrier * m. ackerstaff@xmath1, a. airapetrou & j. de roeck & a. stiml + department of molecular and cellular biology, university of california, los angeles, ca 90089, usa + e - mail : a.aira@univ-caltech.edu * msc.lbl.ed.u.s. : biophysics department, national institutes of theoretical physics, p.o. box 14, morgant

we present new observations of the protostar iras 16293@xmath02422 with the submillimeter array ( sma ) and an analysis of archival vla data. the sma reveals a binary system consisting of two components. one is classical ` ` first - generation '' hydrogen core molecules associated with the @xmath3 ophiuchi molecular cloud, and the other is an as - yet unidentified companion which accounts for both the millimeter continuum emission and the large - scale ne sw molecular outflow. in order to determine the abundance of second generation molecules we have measured the density and temperature profiles as a function of radius from analysis of the continuum data. we show that the hot core material has a rather complicated temperature distribution, with temperature increases coming from the source centimeter emission and consistent with accretion onto the compact core. the lower limit for the temperature can be explained by the presence of a grainy, deuterated envelope, which is moving in the opposite direction from the jet axis. the abundances of the first generation molecules are very similar to those reported by schier et al. ( 2002 ), but the second generation abundance is about an order of magnitude lower. this may indicate that, on small size scales, the hydrogen core material is not in equilibrium with its environment, but is instead in a phase of accretion. we identify the centimeter radio source a2 as the driving source of the molecular outflows, although we can not rule out a contribution from a second source. the molecular emission from source a is red and smooth, and is probably produced in a different part of the atmosphere than source b. given the redshifted molecular emission, it is likely that a1 is the progenitor of a2. the low metallicity of source b leads us to conclude that it may not even be in an accretion phase. there may be some evidence for self - gravitation, but this need to be confirmed by observations in the near future.
we review some of the latest developments in configuration space analysis of feynman diagrams including developments in the recent years on the calculation of asymptotic expansions in various kinematical regimes. the analysis of such expansions is particularly important for the calculations of radiative corrections in high energy physics where one is aiming at a direct discovery of new physical phenomena and fundamental constituents of matter ( elementary particles ). this requires ever more powerful accelerating facilities for an efficient evaluation of the many quantities of interest and a high accuracy of the theoretical calculations. one of the examples is the direct computation of the spectral density of sunrise - type diagrams without taking recourse to fourier transforms. this two - fold road to scientific discovery has been pursued for ages. we also generalize the configuration space technique to other topologies and especially to non - standard propagators. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 11 # 1 = by60 = # 1bsphack@filesw gtempaauxout gtempere m@xmath0 # 1 # 1 hep - th/#1 # 1(#2)#3 nucl. phys. b ( proc. suppl.)#1#2 # 1 ( # 2 ) # 1 latexl-.36em.7ex-.7ex # 1 @=11 # 1 1= by60 -12.1em /-.15em # 1 -12 # 1 ^ - - -_-6 # 1 * * sunrise - type sunburn - type diagram * * satsuki oda + _ to be submitted to phys. lett. b _ + the astronomical journal ( astronomical journal c ) _ + j. s. littlewood + _ research in astronomy and astrophysics, the university of tokyo, kashiwa, chiba 277 - 8582, japan _ + e - mail : sunflower@sutd.ac.jp _ _ we present a comprehensive report on configuration space techniques including many technical details such that an interested reader can use this report as a practical guide for practical calculations. we include a great deal of mathematical material such that the report is self - contained to a large degree. the calculational methods used are rather well - suited for further development and can easily be tailored to the further specific needs of the potential user. using the results of this paper one can
we investigate the thz frequency - dependent carrier mobility and interband recombination dynamics in multilayer mos@xmath0 using time - domain spectroscopy. using an optical - pump thz pulse, we measure the carrier density before and after photoexcitation and determine the carrier momentum scattering time, @xmath1 ns, at different temperatures ( 30, 45, 100, 200, 300 k ). we find a high mobility for the photoexcited carriers ( 257 @xday ) at 300 k. the measured mobility is consistent with recent electronic transport measurements in multiilayer multi - layer molybdenum disulfide. at temperatures below 200 k, we find acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant mobility - limiting mechanism. the measured carrier mobility increases with the frequency and eventually exceeds the drude conductivity of the high mobility regions. this behavior is similar to that expected for picosecond carrier recombination in semiconductors. our results suggest that the long - momentum scattering times are limited by the intraband conductivity and the low mobility regions are generally insensitive to temperature variation. we present a model of carrier relaxation and recombination that accounts for all features observed in our experiments. our findings suggest that both electron and hole recombination are important for the design of future spintronic and optoelectronic devices in the telecommunications - band. heisenberg hamiltonian, department of physics, rice university, p. o. box 1892, + houston, tx 77251, usa + http://www.rice.edu/~t00fri/rho/summaries/rice.cfm?uri=oe-17-3-801. the success of the photonic and electronic devices in recent years has been due to the efficient capture of electrons and holes by defects in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite. as a result, the electrical properties of these materials have improved significantly over the past decade. however, the nature of the defects and the resulting carrier dynamics are not well understood. in particular, it is not clear if the fast - cooling photonic state captures electrons or holes from the defect states in the bandgap and if the captured states remain localized in the photoluminescent region. in this article, we introduce and discuss an investigation into this question using thz transmission measurements as a sensitive probe of carrier dynamics in multi- and multi - dimensional disordered materials. we aim to investigate the effect of impurities, defects, crystal defects, and imp
we calculate the two - flavor qcd light hadron spectrum at a continuum spacing of @xmath0 fm and discuss the implications for qcd simulations with dynamical quarks. we employ an improved clover quark action for the gauge field, and a mean field improved sheikholeslami - wohlert clover action for both the quark field and the strange quark. with these actions, hadron masses show reasonable scaling behavior and the static quark potential good rotational symmetry, at a coarse lattice spacing of about 3 fm, as compared to the range of 4 fm needed for the standard plaquette and wilson quark actions. including the sea quark effects leads to tighter constraints on quark masses, and consequently a tighter constraint on qcd parameters. we obtain a mean - field chiral limit using three different lattice spacings. compromising on a lattice of physical size four times larger than that used for the continuum extrapolation avoids size - dependent errors. we derive exact expressions for the different decay constants, important for phenomenological analyses of the standard model. our results show a close agreement with experiment. in particular, the decuplet baryon mass splitting is smaller than experiment by about 20 %. we also investigate the quenched spectrum from experiment, and find a clear and systematic deviation from experiment ; when one uses hadron mass for input to fix the physical scale, the hyperfine splitting is too small by about 10 %. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm = cmbx12 = cmr10 scaled 2 to * exact calculations with improved lattice actions * + _ institute of theoretical physics, chinese academy of sciences, beijing 100049, china _ + _ department of physics, carnegie mellon university, p. o. box 210, university park, pa 16802, usa _
clusters of galaxies are the largest and most massive collapsed objects in the universe, and as such they are sensitive probes of the history of structure formation. a detailed understanding of their evolution would constrain numerous theories of large - scale structure. clusters are luminous, extended x - ray sources, and are visible out to high redshifts with present - day technology. their density and temperature profiles provide an accurate measurement of the dark matter distribution in the cluster. the distribution of the elements in clusters reveals how the metals were removed from stellar systems and into the intergalactic medium ( igm ). the evolution of the baryonic content of the universe is also directly linked to the structure of clusters. as discussed at this conference, the form of the potential in clusters should be determined on the basis of zero - point cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data. the cmb data are from the _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes. the asca data have line emission from h and he - like states, and the abundances of elements can be well determined. many of the metals in the _ chandra _ images of distant clusters are made in stars, which lie primarily in galaxies, and so most of metals have either been ejected or removed from the galaxies. the ` ` excess '' amount of fe seen in the central regions of cd galaxies is roughly consistent with its being produced in the stars of the central cd galaxy. the chemical evolution of fe in clusters is remarkably similar to that of galaxies. type ia supernovae produce mostly fe and ni, while type ii sne produce a wide range of elements but large ratios of the @xmath0 elements ( o, ne, and si ) to fe. the relatively high fe / fe ratio seen in clusters probably results from the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sn ) effect. the sn type must be very large in order to explain the fe distribution in clusters.

we use the intrinsic stellar colour, @xmath0, as a direct measure of galaxy mass to develop and apply a quantitative, phenomenological description of the bimodality in galaxy stellar populations. the crux of the problem is that the ( optical ) colour distributions of the apparently distinct red and blue populations are seen to overlap. therefore, for a statistically rigorous analysis, it is necessary to identify which galaxies are members of the two populations. we use the results of stellar population synthesis ( sps ) modelling of broadband spectral energy distributions, rather than simple restframe luminosities and colours. in order to do this, we use sps - derived stellar mass estimates as our proxy for total stellar content, and we employ our objective mixture modelling formalism, which allows us to identify galaxies without dusty star - forming regions ( _ i.e. _, ` r'type galaxies ). in this way, we show that, at _ fixed _ mass, the elliptical ` early type'galaxies are older, redder, and smaller than the ` late type'spirals. this analysis thus reinforces the idea that the galaxy population can be naturally subdivided into two ( and only two ) broad classes. we provide a more pedagogical discussion of our approach, and explain why this approach can be so meaningful in the future. in addition, we derive the mass completeness limits and the redshift self - consistency limits for different mass bins. we discuss how our results can be used to meaningfully constrain dust obscurations and intrinsic stellar colours in galaxies. these results will help fast - track researchers intending to apply a similar mixture - modelling analysis to their own data.
we report extensive multi - frequency observations of the peculiar radio source sn 1988z at wavelengths of 1.425 ghz, 6.76 cm, 3.6 cm and 2.0 cm made with the very large array from 1988 may 4 through 2001 january 25. we supplement these observations with new monitoring observations made by van dyk et al. over the first 8.5 years after discovery. the uninterrupted, multi - wavelength data are well described by two time intervals : ` ` early '' data obtained from day 1 through day 1479, and ` ` late '' data taken from day 2129 through the end of the dataset. the early data indicate that ( a ) the number density of clumps per unit comoving volume, @xmath0, starts decreasing more rapidly with radius, as measured by ( b ) the average characteristics of the individual clumps remain unchanged, and ( c ) most of the absorption occurs within the emitting clumps themselves. thus, it appears that the steepening of the nonthermal radio light curves in the early years of 1988z is due to the change in the intrinsic brightness brightness, not to an effect of the expanding sn blastwave. ( d ) the h@xmath1 light curve can be described by a model consisting of multiple filamentary clumps surrounded by a highly condensed, filamentary circumstellar medium ( csm ), which can effectively describe the sn s properties so well. we find that ( 1 ) the csm has a density that is within a factor of two of that which is described by the standard model ; ( 2 ) the radio emission ( e.g., synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) and non - thermal emission at 5 ghz were dominant at early times ; but ( 3 ) the ssa and f - f components have been decreasing since the early times, consistent with the tendency for these components to be closer to the line - of - sight. ( 4 ) at the time of writing, the radio flux densities of j1051 + 213 and j1125 + 261 have been unusually high, perhaps indicative of the collapse of the progenitor core into a black hole.

we present a broadband x - ray study of the radio - bright, young supernova remnant 3c 397 ( g41.1 - 0.3 ) using the hri and pca. the data have a complex, asymmetric morphology, with a central hot spot and a double - lobed radio shell which is the most strongly correlated with the radio shell. a total of @xmath0 100 lines are detected from the remnant, with the most probable emission originating from a hot spot located at the center of the snr shell. while has the highest spatial resolution, has the higher spectral and energy coverage and signal - to - noise ratio, allowing us to search for pulsations from any hidden pulsar down to the millisecond range. no pulsations are found, and spectral fits with a collisionally equilibrium ionization model indicate that the soft thermal component and the hard component are nearly thermal. the 515 kev pca spectrum, though contaminated by the emission from the galactic ridge, shows emission lines of mg, si, s, ar and fe, as well as strong emission lines from mg and n, at rest wavelengths of 0.75 - 1.2 kev. the remnant is weakly detected in the image of,, and, implying an average ionization time - scale close to 10@xmath1 within the central spot of about 60 ms. fitting a thermal model to the hard and soft components implies an electron temperature near 0.7 kev and a shock temperature of 2.2 - 2.3 kev, depending on the relative velocity of the ejecta. the origin of the hard emission is not clear, but it is likely to be synchrotron emission from highly relativistic particles accelerated at the shock. the abundance ratios with respect to si are certainly inconsistent with a type ia yield, but they are consistent with an explosion of a massive progenitor. we discuss the two - component model for the remnant in light of its morphology, in the framework of a young ejecta - dominated remnant at the centers of massive star progenitors, and a medium - aged remnant in a dense interstellar medium.
the chemical evolution of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies is studied in the framework of different cosmological models. two different models for the evolution of elliptical galaxies, which are the main contributors to the icm enrichment, are considered. we use either a one - zone model ( matteucci and gibson 1995 ) or a multi - zone one ( martinelli et al. 1998 ; continuous model ) for ellipticals, where the galactic wind develops at early times in all galaxies and continues until the present time in the most internal ones. we assume that the outermost regions of these galaxies experience early galactic winds whereas the innnermost ones keep an active star formation rate until late times. we study the behaviour of several chemical abundance ratios, in particular the values of @xmath0-elements [ si / h ] and [ s / fe ], as well as the fe abundances, as a function of redshift under the assumptions of a flat, scale invariant, cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology ( replacing the term ` ` ` continuous '' with ` ` burst '' in this paper ). we find that : ( 1 ) in the burst model the gas ejected by ellipticals is mainly enriched by type ii sne, owing to the products of sne ii, o, si and s, whereas the contribution of type ia sne is insignificant in the continuous model. ( 2 ) the total amount of si ejected by each elliptical galaxy is a factor of several less than that due to sne ia, in the both the burst and continuous models. ( 3 ) within the continuous models the fe abundance is enhanced by factors of 2 - 3 due to the presence of early and late galactic winds, whereas within the bursts model no significant enhancement of fe is found. ( 4 ) for the total gas masses ejected by the ellipticals we predict [ fe / h]=0.2-+0.3 dex in the bursts models and underestimate the amount of fe that is lost by the accretion of fresh gas. on the other hand, we find a slight enhancement of the predicted [ s/fe ] relative to the solar value ( at all redshifts ) due to all the extra - solar abundance ratio in the constant stellar population of ellipticals. ( 5 ) the difference between the predicted values of the metal abundances in the two continuous models and the observed values in the observed icm is negligible between the idealized and the realistic values in several redshift bins.

we have used the _ asca _ satellite to search for a hidden ionizing source in a sample of three ` ` liner 2s '' ( ngc 404, ngc 4111, and ngc 4569 ) that show broad h@xmath0 emission ( the type 1 nuclei ). all three objects have soft x - ray spectra which can be represented by a raymond - smith thermal plasma with an e - folding energy of @xmath1 kev. the specific eddington ratios of the material at the center of the nuclei, depending on the ionization source, are between 0.7 and 1.8. if the soft thermal component is due to ionization by an active nucleus, the estimated agn column densities are a factor of 10 to 100 smaller than those in typical seyfert galaxies. in order to be genuine agns, the emission from their nuclei must be heavily obscured. we do not detect any clear evidence for the presence of an agn in the three galaxies. instead, we find that the uv - bright objects in our sample have uv bolometric luminosities consistent with those of bright galaxies without agn. this suggests that the accretion in these objects is either very low accretion rate or with a very low efficiency, as is in most galaxies. finally, we note that the optical emission lines of liner 2 s are significantly weaker than those of, and probably originate in, its host galaxy. if this is the case, the liner 2 nuclei are the most abundant form of low - level activity in nearby galaxies. consequently, they should be less luminous than, and in some cases even dwarf galaxies, which have higher accretion rates, should appear as luminous.

we study the [ c ii ] 158 line emission from photoelectron - heated dust grains and the far infrared ( fir ) emission from translucent molecular clouds ( hlcs ) observed with the _ iso _ satellite. we present new data for a total of 162 _ iso_/iras / iso_60/100 positions in the high latitude region ( @xmath0 ). we use these data to compare with _ cobe _ c ii and fir emission toward a grid of 73 nearby ( 12@xmath1departamento de fsica aplicada, university of mxico, p.o. box 1615, 00040, chile. our results are compared with previously published data and with models for the photoelectric heating of the gas, assuming that the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) is proportional to the proportionality of fuv and non - fuv radiation onto dust grains. the line - of - sight [ cii ] emissivity decreases linearly with the increasing fractional attenuation of the isrf, as expected for a photoelectric effect dominated by photoelectric photons of all wavelengths. we also find that the density of [ c i ] emitting gas at high galactic latitudes is nearly constant with column density, confirming the result of our model. with a lower limit to the column density due to the intrinsic extinction of far infrared radiation, the average c ii]emissivity is lower, by about an order of magnitude, than expected from the average h i emission averaged over the whole sky. using the firas 60/100 color - color diagram, we can estimate the average photoelectric h i column density. the average value of the paper is consistent with the value determined from _ iso_-hlcs using the co emission - line spectrum, and is only weakly dependent on the total amounts of atomic and molecular gas as the main source of heating. we develop a model for the radiative transfer of interstellar radiation fields from dust grains to the gas that allows us to predict the emission line and continuum properties of the cnm. the model shows that the observed lower limits for the average radiation field intensity and cloud size are caused by the lower metallicities in the cold, dense clouds than in the warm, warm, and cold clouds. it also shows that photoelectric heat is transferred from the gas to the dust grains directly, and not via changes in dust properties. in addition, we show that the low extinction of _ iras data is a strong function of the column
we study the influence of interactions on the behavior of disordered quantum hall electrons in two - dimensional hartree - fock models. microscopic corrections to scaling are incorporated in a self - consistent model for the case of a disordered system of linear dimension @xmath0 without interactions. we find a strong dependence of the conductivity on the bare conductivity and argue that it becomes fractional at low magnetic fields where interactions are relevant only at the non - interacting fixed point. this behavior is in stark contrast to the experimental situation, where for sufficiently strong interactions the system exhibits a non - monotonic series of plateaus, with the hall resistivity increasing with decreasing magnetic field below the plateau. it is shown how the conductivities change with the interaction strength and the range of possible values for the critical exponents are determined by how the system is modelled. the possibility of a new physics entirely driven by interactions is discussed and possible experimental signatures of the new critical point are indicated. despite its global character, the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is an intriguing entity that has attracted a lot of interest in recent years @xcite. the interest in the qhe is driven by its possible applications to quantum information processing, quantum computation, spintronics, and high - precision spectroscopy. most of the works on the subject have been performed in the context of semiclassical systems, focusing on the zero - temperature behavior of the tunneling density of states ( dos ) and ground states of the system. this study highlights the role of interactions in this important for a wide range of systems in shedding light on the physics of qhe. interactions and is a step forward in our understanding of the nature of these critical phenomena. interactions are crucial as they not only change the demarcating boundaries of the quantum phase, but can also drive the system towards a quantum critical point. the phenomenon of quantum criticality was first observed in the early 90 s for disordered, one - dimensional ( 1d ) electrons in a magnetic field, demonstrating the presence of a unique quantum phase transition from the landau level insulator ( lsi ) to an insulating state, the quasiparticle superfluid, and eventually leading to the fractional quantum hall ( qh ) state, at magnetic fields up to 2

we present the first results from a new survey to be called chang - es ( the expanded very large array ) to study the radio continuum halos of 35 nearby edge - on, normal spiral galaxies. the survey is being carried out in three arrays ( b, c, and d ), but the test data were obtained at both frequencies in a single configuration only. in this paper, we outline the observations and data reduction procedures used for the first time. we include a detailed description of the instrumentation and hardware ( hardware ) necessary to support the multi - frequency synthesis process as well as the methods for correcting for instrumental polarization errors. we then present maps of linear polarization intensity, p, and magnetic field position angle ; total intensity images and polarization products are presented and compared with previous observations. as has always been done, we first fourier transform the data to the map plane, resulting in an image which is the convolution of the ft of the antenna distribution in the uv plane ( the ` dirty beam') with the source sky brightness distribution. as in previous studies of this galaxy, we find that the off - axis instrumental polarization for the 1.5 and 6 ghz bands is relatively small ( @xmath0 a few percent ). we therefore expect the emission to be predominantly from the disk - halo interface, although we do not rule out a contribution from the halo spheroid. we also find that it is possible to partially correct for ionospheric faraday rotation in the c - band images ( which is sensitive to total - intensity fluctuations ), assuming that the thermal pressure is sufficient to confine hot gas to within 10 % for all sources. we find this to be difficult, although not impossible, provided that the accurate on - axis position angle is known. the rms noise on the q - band maps is found to be well below the observed in the i - band and therefore we are not expected to detect any residual linear - cleaning artifacts in these images. by comparison, we have, however, found that residual linear cleaning artifacts are visible immediately to the east and west of the galaxy s disk.

these are notes from the lectures i gave at the nato asi ` gasdynamics workshop'at the isaac newton institute in cambridge ( june 25/01, 1997 ). their goal is an informal introduction to asymptotic statistical mechanics at far from equilibrium. these notes are based on the two review papers @xcite by b. derrida and c. fokker - planck. we shall describe some mathematical techniques that we have developed and used to study non - equilibrium markov processes. a remarkable feature of these systems is the absence of energy and of their dynamical properties : they behave as if they were in a stationary current ( current fluctuations brownian - like ). this current is shown to be a fundamental property of the stationary state, that allows us to predict the statistical properties of the current and to derive analytically the response coefficients from the knowledge of equilibrium fluctuations. some of these properties can be extended to many - body systems that are out of equilibrium. this topic is discussed in some detail. another topic discussed is the microcanonical measure, that is the microscopic version of the fluctuation - dissipation relation, that plays an important role in the analysis of large deviation functions. this relation is built on the background of the brownian motion. it is shown how a markov probability distribution can be interpreted as a function of the previous ( micro - state ) history of the system, the dynamics and the current fluctuations. finally, some applications of these ideas are outlined for the asep, in particular, the description of asymmetric random walks on a lattice, the pipe model and for the mean - field phase - space model. _ keywords _ : markov system, non - equilibria, master equation, small deviations, small deviation function, hydrodynamic system, classical fluctuations, irreversible stationary dynamics, energy and momenta distributions, equilibrium fluctuations, periodic boundary conditions, markov process, energy distribution, conductance, susceptibilities, large deviation function.
the effects of a shear on the microlensing light curves and the astrometric centroid shift trajectories are discussed. the lens shear is evaluated for a system that consists of a lens with mass @xmath0 at the center of a centered point mass ( lensing star ) and an additional mass placed far away from the lens ( source ). when the mass distribution is a point mass, the lens splits the source star into two images. the separation between the images is of the order of the einstein ring radius, and the reduced shear corresponds to the magnification - weighted mean of the images. for small enough values of the ratio, the shear causes a reduction of the difference between the projected lens - source separation vectors by several orders of magnitude. the time of maximum distortion depends on the magnitude of the maximum distortion and the distances from the source to the lens. in the case of a planar mass distribution, the deflection potential is the same for different choices of the lensing mass and position angle, and may be as large as 0.8 mag. the galactic bulge is a good example of the galactic sub - structures due to its relatively large scale of influence. the light curve of the background star is significantly asymmetric in the presence of shear, and becomes nearly symmetric even for the slightest variations of the position angle of the source along the line of sight. we find that when the lens and source positions are separated by a few einstein radii, the maximum shear produced by the bulge at 8.5 kpc from the earth and embedded in a uniform galactic halo is well described by the above - mentioned point mass plus quadrupole lens model. the typical source in the binary companion scenario is a low - mass exoplanet lying at the mass limit of the system. although the actual source may not be obvious, the implied distances are larger than those given by the standard astronomical lens models, which may explain the small detection rate of edge - on planets around the galactic lens.

a theory of liquid ginzburg - landau - like glass condensates is presented. the phonon field is described by a free theory that spontaneously breaks the @xmath0 symmetry to the true ground state for a certain range of frequencies. this provides a microscopic insight into the liquid vibrational states. a general formulation of the general theory is proposed based on the symmetry breaking and the symmetry being spontaneously broken by particle excitations. the resulting theory predicts a frequency cutoff of shear modes with frequency larger than twice the debye frequency of the liquid. this is contrary to the earlier surprising result that the liquid does not support shear waves at all frequencies as the solid does. we discuss the physical consequences of these facts for the glassy state of the fluid. glasses have been widely viewed as not a separate state of matter but as a slowly flowing liquid, with relaxation time exceeding observation time. in recent years, however, the understanding of the true nature of glasses has shifted to a new level with the introduction of quantum many - body effects such as quantum tunneling. these effects are best understood as the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry by which a small parameter, such as the lattice spacing, a parameter that characterizes the distance between an atom or a molecule in the glass @xcite. in this paper, we discuss a general approach towards the breaking of symmetry breaking that spontaneously occurs in solids and that does not depend on interactions between the atoms. the underlying idea is that a certain symmetry is spontaneously broken when a particle ( e.g. an atom, molecule, cloud ) jumps from a position in space, which leaves the system in a quasi - vacuum state. this means that the system is no longer a fluid and therefore supports a shear mode only as an elastic medium. more precisely, a liquid is a solid, and for a given a temperature, supports one mode that is not invariant under localization, i.e. the longitudinal mode. in the ref.@xcite, the ability of a liquid to support such a mode is demonstrated by showing that at high temperatures the system undergoes a transition from a metastable to a stable ( or metastable ) transition, as the shear stress increases. more recently, the transition was observed in ultracold gases of course, but the situation is more complex. namely, ultra - cold gases with ultra - low temperature ( below the kosterlitz thouless temperature ), in which the system supports transverse shear vibrations, and therefore can not support a
we have studied the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters selected by x - ray flux from sdss galaxies and compared it with the results of simulations of clusters taken from the ` ` marenostrum universe ''. from the analysis of the sdss dr6 main galaxy database we have constructed a volume limited sample of 233 x - clusters with redshifts limited by @xmath0 ( approximately 0.12 ) that are located more than 10 mpc away from sample boundaries. we have also performed multi - scaling analyses of the galaxy number density in these regions using the friend - of - friend algorithm and the generalized scaling analysis. on scales of 100 - 200 mpc the observed and simulated clusters show very similar scaling properties : the number density of clusters shows a constant value at the scale of 10 - 20 mpc and increases with radius of the spheres. the similarity of the scaling behaviour of the clusters and galaxies on these scales is a signature of the universality of the observed distribution and is a sign of the unique complexity of cluster formation. however, the scaling properties of clusters are not well described by a single power law and the exponent of the conditional correlation function ( ccf ) for galaxies is difficult to constrain. we put the most successful interpretation of the data in the framework of biased galaxy formation theories. on the scales of superclusters we found that the slope of the ccf is in general negative, and there is a complex mixture of slopes up to 50 mpc with galaxies clustering in the most massive clusters. in contrast to the observed number density distribution, the simulated ( uncorrelated cluster ) density does not show a negative value for low density regions, but shows a gradual transition to homogeneity at about 100 mpc. cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function shows a significant excess in high density regions. the magnitude of this excess is of the same order of magnitude as observed in the galaxy distribution and does not depend on the size of the voids. we attribute this excess to the fact that in the simulations the number of clusters more luminous than m * tends to be more clustered. galaxies : clusters : general - cosmology : theory - dark matter - large - scale structure of universe - galaxies : statistics
we report on the latest analysis of the _ wmap _ 5-year data, which extends the previous 3-year results by @xmath0 %. we use only w band ( v and w ) data for cosmological analysis, and we demonstrate that the inclusion of cmb and galaxies in the analysis leads to important results : the primordial density fluctuations, the likelihood of tb and eb power spectra, and the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. we find that the cmb temperature data alone give an accurate value for the density of dark matter ( 21.4 % ), the expansion rate of the universe ( 0.011.04 mpc@xmath1 ), and nearly scale - invariant adiabatic gaussian fluctuations ( 16.6 % ). using only the w band data, we find the following additional constraints : the energy density of baryons and that of photons at the epoch of photon - baryon decoupling are consistent with being nearly the same at various epochs. we show that parity - violating interactions between dark energy and photons are less significant than previously thought, and that the lack of such interactions can be explained by the non - linearities in the distributions of matter and light at very low redshifts. we discuss how these results challenge the standard cold dark matter model, and how the growth of structure has been conditioned by the fluctuations in the microwave background. we also study the polarization of the data and find no evidence for systematic errors in the foreground emission. as we did in previous papers, we use the template - based beam - transfer function method to clean the foreground emissions in both the temperature and polarization data. with this method, the fractional beam error in the temperature data as a function of the beam tilt and axis is now well below the 3 % expected error from the mis - calibrated beam. we expect the effect of mis - calibration on the results to be sub - dominant in the error budget. future cmb ground and balloon - borne experiments will play an important role in addressing these questions.
we develop a non - perturbative generalization of the symmetry improvement formalism for two particle irreducible effective actions for gauge theories with spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry. we achieve this by taking a limit in which the lagrange multiplier vanishes from all but one of the equations of motion. since the constraints are singular, a careful consideration of the variational procedure required to obtain a self - consistent non - equilibrium kinetic theory of gauge theories, allows one to impose ward identities which impose constraints in a way that satisfies dalembert s principle. when the symmetry is broken the theory can be renormalized in a more or less standard way, though the counter - terms differ in value from the unimproved case. we consider a simple example of the generalization procedure for a scalar field theory with a third vertex. we extend the work of pilaftsis and teresi [ phys. rev. lett. * 105 *, 153 ( 2000 ) ] to the 3-dimensional @xmath0-regular kinetic theory. we derive finite equations and counterterms for the hartree - fock truncation, two loops truncation and three loops of the effective action. we find excellent qualitative results : the higgs decay width is correctly reproduced in the 3piea, though goldstone s theorem is satisfied, and the phase transition is incorrectly predicted to be weakly first order. we predict that unsatisfactory results of this kind will be found in any theory with finite temperature and density. we also compare the analytic results of the 3pi with numerical methods. the symmetry improved 3pi performs much better than an ad hoc resummation scheme recently proposed in the literature. as an example, during the preparation of this manuscript it was shown that the 2piea solves problems with infrared divergences of the standard model effective potential due to massless goldstone bosons. further developments are needed in this area ( see, e.g. @xcite and references therein ). = 1
we investigate the dynamic rheology of a model polymer melt in non - uniform oscillatory shear flows between rapidly oscillating plates by using the hybrid simulation of molecular dynamics ( md ) and computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ). the local stresses of the melt are calculated by using molecular dynamic simulations of polymer chains according to the local strain rates. we find that the ` ` local '' stress in the melt depends on the strain amplitude of the system and the oscillation frequency of the oscillating plate. the resulting stress relaxation function, which describes the behavior of the local quantities, can be approximately described by the sum of the stretched relaxation functions of the macroscopic quantities. however, in the linear viscoelastic response regime, the local rheological properties become heterogeneous depending on the local flow variables. thus, the results of the present hybrid simulation are not known in general. we also investigate the effect of the non - linear effect of higher harmonics ( i.e., higher than the storage modulus and loss modulus ) on the moduli using the heterogeneous multiscale method ( hmm ). in the present study, the distribution function of the shear moduli is calculated as the integral of the stress relaxation functions in the quiescent state and the transient force in the high frequency regime. although the early oscillation mode of @xmath0 corresponds to the vibrations of the bonds of bead particles on each chain, the late oscillation, with larger variations of the strain amplitudes, correspond to the stretched exponential relaxation of the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) form. the logarithm of the onset of shear thinning is found to coincide with that of the semimajor axis relaxation for the early stage of the soft - ionization cycle of the polymer melt. furthermore, we also show that the peak and the mid - plane directions of the ( multiphase ) stress relaxation are also connected via the ( multi - conjugate ) laos analysis.
the launch of several sensitive multi - wavelength instruments during the past decade heralded a new era in astronomy. here i review the state of play and look ahead to likely advances in the coming years. i start with a brief introduction to the instruments and studies that have enabled these exciting developments. in particular the first large - scale imaging survey of local starbursts the _ lyman alpha reference sample _ ( lars ) has enabled the first systematic study of the sizes of galaxy halos and the comparison with other wavelengths. this review focuses on observations that directly probe the phase, by measuring the 21 cm emission line. this provides a unique suite of information about the ism of galaxies that still can not be extracted using other techniques. by combining this literature we now have substantial power to determine how is regulated and test for the primary effects in homogeneously selected galaxies that do and do not emit. secondary observations will allow us to read kinematic information off the line profile, which hinge upon knowing the fluxes of sources within the range of the galex spectrograph. many studies of active galaxies in the nearby universe have already revealed important properties related to their atomic gas properties. these have included measurements of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ), measurements of far infrared continuum for both hot and cold dust, x - ray observations of coronal gas, and many more. i proceed to discuss the results from small - scale resolved analyses and thompson scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ). in this review i present a case study of one system, an easterly knot c, which is the faintest of the three in but brightest in the uv. this object shows reionization in a recent episode of active galaxy formation, and is one of the most luminous and radio - luminous objects in the local universe ( @xmath0 ). by studying its properties i infer that the process that accelerates the formation of star - forming galaxies may be very local, and has likely not yet reached its full potential.

collective search is a classical problem that has been extensively studied in different fields of science. most of the research for graph exploration is concerned with a single deterministic agent exploring a finite graph with some restrictions on the resources of the agent and/or on the graph structure. unfortunately, in many works, the random walk turned out to be inefficient in the two - dimensional infinite grid. in this paper, we theoretically address general questions of collective search in the particular natural setting described above. more precisely, we introduce the _ ants problem _ problem, a generalization of the cow - path problem. we show that if the agents have a constant approximation of their total number @xmath0, then there exists a simple search algorithm whose expected running time in the three - dimensional plane is @xma0-competitive. as a corollary, it follows that, if agents can achieve an asymptotically optimal running time without any information regarding the total number of agents, then their competitiveness must be @xmb - competitive. in particular, this implies that, for every constant @xfiguration of the starting direction and for every initial distance from the center of the central location, we find a uniform search algorithm that runs sufficiently fast ( in terms of the time it takes to find nearby treasures ) to provide a good representation of the competitiveness of the overall search. we further show that uniform search algorithms that optimize the search efficiency ( or speed - up ) are also potentially interesting, as such, they may have relevance for actual biological scenarios. our work falls within the scope of natural algorithms, a recent attempt to investigate biological phenomena from an algorithmic perspective. we use tools from distributed computing to study a biologically inspired scenario in which a group of agents ( _ robots _ ) initially located at one central location search for treasures in the plane. the goal of the agents is to locate nearby treasures as fast as possible and at a rate that scales well with the number of participating agents. this central location could be a food storage area, a nest where offspring are reared or simply a sheltered or familiar environment. indeed, central place foraging holds a strong preference to locating nearby treasures before those that are further away. collective foraging around a central location is particularly interesting in the case of social insects where large groups forage cooperatively with practically, practically, no competition between individuals. hence, the questions of how efficient the search can be if the communication is limited, or altogether absent, is of great importance.
in this work we provide the first known constructions of ` ` ` anomalous '' disordered hyperuniform many - particle ground states possessing anomalous local density fluctuations, which are defined by a number variance that asymptotically scales faster than the surface area of an observation window but slower than the interior of the space. key to these observations is the presence of large voids external to the particle space that are enforced by the local coordination structure of the point distribution. by varying the fraction of constrained degrees of freedom within the system, we are able to investigate the relationship between hyperununiformity and internal constraints on the local structure. we present detailed statistics for the void space distribution for all of these configurations under weak and strong constraints, demonstrating the variety of possible structures within this class of systems. in particular, we show that our ultralow - dimensional point patterns exhibit substantial clustering, resulting in a highly inhomogeneous local structure ; however, on the global scale of the system as measured by local density fluctuation, these local clusters are separated by comparatively large interparticle voids, thereby regularizing the microstructure and preserving the constraint of hyperunionity that we impose. indeed, for high enough constraints, the characteristic ratio of the _ void space _ distribution to the _ local coordination _ distribution exhibits an exponential form with a small - wavenumber scaling parameter @xmath0, in agreement with prior work on mrj packings of binary hard disks. this provides strong evidence that spatial distribution is important in obtaining the observed properties of these point patterns, and we provide a connection between the shape of the local void space and the _ pair correlation _, which is directly measurable in our numerical constructions. moreover, for low confining fractions of the total number of particles, the evolution of pair correlation amplitude with the number of constraints imposed on the particle distribution is remarkably similar to that expected for the ` ` regular '' mesoscopic system. our results have implications for understanding how the appearance of pair correlations is affected by the effective design of novel stealth materials and the identification of unusual disordered classical ground states.
we present deep photometry with the gmos instrument on the gemini telescopes for the globular cluster systems in five nearby early - type galaxies : ngc 3379, ngc 4649,ngc 5193, ic 4329 and ngc 3311. all the galaxies were observed in multiple pointings over a wide radial range. results in terms of colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams are presented. the galactocentric colour gradients and gc integrated luminosity functions are presented in detail. the mean colours of the peaks of red gcs follow a well defined luminosity - colour relation in the sense that these peaks become redder with increasing galaxy luminosity. this is indicative of a larger gcs chemical abundance scale for the most luminous galaxies which, being more massive, are able of a more efficient enrichment. the most massive system in our sample lies outside the plane defined by gc systems in the logarithmic 3-d space determined by galaxy stellar mass, projected stellar mass density and gcs formation efficiency. the blue gcs, on the other hand, do not show such a relation and we interpret this as a result of a different gcs metallicity relation ( mmr ) with an enhanced metal abundance scale. we also present srsic law fits in the case of the two brightest galaxies for which we have a good areal coverage. moreover, we find that the galaxy gradient matches the red gc subpopulation gradient in both absolute colour and in slope over a common radial range which is an important feature for any theory of galaxy formation. a population of ultra compact dwarf ( ucd ) candidates ( resolved and unresolved ones with 15 @xmath0 _ m@xmath1 _ @xcmath2 ) were detected in all galaxies. ngc 3923 shows the highest number of associated objects, followed by ngc4649 and ngx 3115. this result indicates that ucd are indeed a common feature. although the small size of our sample does not allow a definite conclusion in statistical terms, we report the first detection of the ` ` blue tilt '' in ngc 34649 using ground based observations. as a first step towards a statistical analysis of the cluster formation models, we combined the linear relation between their gc metallicitiveness and [ fe / h ] from @xcite with the [ z / h]=[z / h]-0.131 relation found in the literature, leading to an accurate measurement of the gc density and the projected cluster density. in the
we use @xmath0-body simulations to study the formation of the nucleus of the milky way nuclear star cluster ( nsc ). starting from a circular system of initially tidally - truncated globular clusters in the plane of the galaxy, we follow the orbits of the nscs as they spiral in due to dynamical friction against the stars in the disk component. as the clusters reach the galactic center, they are tidal perturbations by the massive black hole ( smbh ) at 20 pc. previous simulations have shown that the mass of a typical globular cluster can be brought to the center of a galaxy via a merger event, bringing it to a size that is consistent with the observed core size. from these simulations, we show that the luminosity function of the nuclear system at the center can be explained as the product of a merger - induced infall of stars and a accretion event that terminates the star formation within a radius, set by the smbh. in our models, the final smbh is surrounded by a very massive bulge of super - massive stars. while the bulge aspherical nucleus is a result of the merger process, the subsequent accretion of stars from the disk gives rise to a remnant cluster with a similar core radius to that of the remnant cluster. we find that the merger scenario is not sufficient to explain the observed properties of either of the nuclei. instead, a model in which the merger of stars brings the system to a nsc that is then dynamically relaxed over a period of time, until it reaches semi - spherical symmetry, produces a nucleus with a core radius that is comparable to the observed size and a total mass that is a factor of two smaller than the observed value. even though we have not reached the final state, the model implies that the decay toward the mw central region of gcs has occurred on a time significantly shorter than the age of the system. the mass - to - light ratio of the non - nuclear stellar bulge to the nuclear stellar mass in our model is roughly unity.
we study a database of e - mail users at an einstein university which has been collected over many decades. using a monte carlo hypothesis testing procedure, we show that the activity of an individual is governed not only by a primary process, but by cascading non - homogeneous poisson process. to compare our model with the empirical data, we develop a simulated annealing procedure which allows us to nonparametrically infer the hidden markov structure of our model. since our model provides an accurate description ofwhen e - mails are sent, we are implicitly assuming that the fraction of time spent in active intervals is very small. we have verified that this is the case for all users under consideration. we demonstrate that our model is consistent with the entire inter - event time distribution whereas the truncated power - law null model is not. demonstrating that a model reproduces the asymptotic scaling of a distribution does not necessarily provide evidence that the model is an accurate mechanistic description of the underlying process. we quantify the agreement between our model and the data by measuring the area @xmath0 between the empirical cumulative distribution function and the model cumulative distribution atxmath1. we observe that circadian and weekly cycles can accurately describe the heavy - tails observed in email communication patterns. this demonstrates how the mixture of scales of activity can give rise to scale - free activity patterns. despite these results, we caution that rational decision making is not a necessary component of human activity. we surmise that the proposed model is readily adjustable and can be extended to incorporate the multitude of activities in which any individual participates. to facilitate the inclusion of additional activities, we suggest a novel experiment : where an individual switches between any two activities with some probability defined by a non - stationary markov transition matrix which depends on time and the likelihood of that individual switching between activities. we suggest that this novel experiment and its extension might provide a basis for the reported universality of heavy - tailed distributions in complex systems.
we simulate the bright foreground emissions from our galaxy, galaxy clusters, extragalactic discrete sources, and the cosmic reionization regions, with which we create the @xmath0 mhz radio sky with high spatial and spectral accuracies. first, we characterize the brightness temperature profiles and spectral properties of the brightest galaxy clusters by introducing an approach designed on the basis of the independent component analysis ( ica ) and wavelet detection algorithm ( shensa 1992 ). then, we simulate the flux densities, spatial structures, synchrotron spectral indices, and angular clusterings of types ( 1)-(3 ) sources following wilman et al. ( 2003 ) method. in order to do so, we use the recently developed fastica + wavelet algorithm ( zhang & wu 2003 ), which allows us to fully take into account the random variations of model parameters in the ranges allowed by the observations. second, we ascribe the failure of detection of the bright cluster component ( if present ) to the following three reasons : ( i ) six of the 14 undetected clusters exhibit relatively flat spectra, which makes it difficult to disentangle them from the galaxy component, ( ii ) five of the clusters are faint and less extended, either embeded in brighter clusters or overlapped by bright discrete sources ; and ( iii ) three of the remaining 14 clusters are less extended and are masked along with adjacent bright compact objects. we also find that 10 of the 12 detected clusters ( if there are only 10 of these in the whole 21cma field of view ) need to be resolvable in the radio sky to be detected, while only 3 of the 18 non - detected clusters do not require any rest - frame spectral work. thus, we conclude that in the next decade, tight observational constrains on the formation and evolution of radio halos of galaxy clusters will be obtained by coordinated observations at low frequencies.

we present zpc 1.0.1, a free open source computer program for solving the boltzmann equations for partons in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. zpc solves the equations by a cascade method, where the partons are taken as independent partons after the nucleus - nucleus collision. the cascade calculation can take into account finite mean free path effect and space cell division optimization. because of the geometric interpretation of the scattering cross section, information travels across the distance of closest approach when a scattering happens in a time period of the fixed time step or the mean free time. this may lead to causality violation. the program is written in the fortran language and it can be used to study systems far from local thermal equilibrium or some ideal initial conditions. + _ computer for which it is designed and the instructions instructions are given. _ + _ title of program _ : zpc + _ catalogue identifier _ : adxx + _ program summary url : _ http://www.cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/zpc2.html + _ distribution format _ : ascii + _ cpc program library and institute of theoretical physics, chinese academy of sciences, beijing, p.r. china + _ computers _ : all + _ operating systems _ : linux, unix + _ programming language used _ : classical computers + _ memory required to execute with typical data _ : @xmath0 mbytes + _ no. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc. _ : size : _ size of the qcalc program is about 2.0 mb + _ has the code been vectorized or parallelized? : no + _ keywords _ : partons, cascade simulation, parton scattering, zpc, minijet gluon system, hadronization, deconfinement phase transition, chiral symmetry restoration + _ nature of the physical problem _ : + computation of parton production and annihilation in high energy collisions and comparison with theoretical predictions.
we analyze the performance of the continuous - variable quantum teleportation protocol using two particular classes of non - gaussian resources, i.e. the squeezed truncated twin beam and the squeezed cat - like states, optimized for the teleportation of input coherent states and input fock states, respectively. we show that the optimal resources admit an optimization procedure in order to maximize the fidelity of teleportation for a given set of input states, and that such an optimization yields a sculptured output teleported state, in perfect agreement with the behavior of the optimal teleportation fidelities. in addition, we characterize and compare resources optimized for each class of resource, and investigate the effect of thermal noise on the efficiency of teleportation. we find that the optimization of the teleportation fidelity provides a significant increase with respect to the standard braunstein - kimble protocol, and also corresponds to an enhancement of the entanglement content. finally, we demonstrate that, despite the thermal noise, the resources provided by the optimized mixed - state extension of squeezed - vacuum affinity yield sufficiently high fidelity, for realistic values of the average thermal number and the squeezing of the local degrees of squeezing. quantum teleportation, the quantum analog of classical teleportation, is a promising candidate for quantum information processing @xcite. in practice, teleportation is usually achieved with a variety of physical resources, and the most popular of them are entangled photon sources. different types of entangled resource are usually employed for different purposes : single - photon source or multiple - photonitter, two - mode resource, superposition of a multiplexed resource, quantum teleportation by emitting photons from an entangled source, or by propagating a entangled photon from one resource to another. + in this paper, we will analyze the feasibility of using a particular class of entangled resources as quantum teleportation resources, characterized by the degree of inviscidity of their characteristic function, as well as by the nature of their role in quantum teleportation. the optimized resource class of general multipartite entangled states will be referred to as the _ mixed resource class _, since all the resources employed in the present analysis are equivalent to the pure resource class. the mixed resource is expected to have a higher fidelity than the unoptimized resource class, and will thus provide an advantage in the overall success probability of teleportation in comparison to the uncorrected case of a single photon. the characterization of the optimized resources and the corresponding optimal fidelity analytically will be presented in future papers. in the meantime, for the sake of concreteness, we provide a detailed analysis and numerical calculations of the above
we compare the predictions of three phenomenological models for the electromagnetic dipole - dipole model with the experimental data for inclusive electroproduction in the resonance region. we show that the model predictions can be represented as an uncertainty in the isospin scaling parameters _ z/^r&=&(1 - 4s^2_w ) - above, @xmath0 and _ ibid. _ can translate into 0.25 % and 0.10 % for the dispersion correction, respectively. the same model is used to fit the high energy non - resonant regge contribution to the transverse virtual photon cross section. the global value of the scaling factor can be estimated from the low energy part of the cross section, and is found to be in good agreement with the data in the experimental domain. in an upcoming work, we plan to extend the analyses of this work to better than 20 % of the total uncertainties in the scaling factors. the q - weak transition is one of the most sensitive phenomena to be studied in the vacuum state because of its non - perturbative nature and the fact that its properties are not only dynamically accessible at low energies but can also be observed at high energies. from a theoretical point of view, the important question is how the electromagnetic scattering cross sections are affected by the transition, in particular, by the presence of background photons. several recent experimental programs, e.g., at the tevatron and jlab, have identified resonances in the transition helicity amplitudes that give rise to high levels of electroproduction. in @xcite, the jlab data was interpreted as evidence for a missing background photon, and a model based on the constituent quark model of lee and schildknecht was proposed to describe the data. using this model, we calculated the scattering amplitude for the strange quark production and related transition form factors. we found that model i ( which includes only background photons ) gave a very good description to the data, so good that we will adopt this model in our analyses and use it as the initial condition for the upcoming qweak experiment. in this paper we address the following questions : + what is the role of background in global electromagnetic cross sections? how does the model depend on the details of the background? what is an alternative to model ii ( which uses the background from model i )? to address some of these questions, we propose a simple phenomenological model that utilizes the three models mentioned above, and argue that it is realistic to constrain
we present preliminary results on the multiplicity, total scalar @xmath0, and charged hadron multiplicity in au+au collisions from the star experiment at rhic. interactions between charged hadrons within 0.15 - 0.5 gev/@xmath1 and a secondary vertex within 4 - 6 centrality bins are used to probe jet structure and equilibration of jets in the high - energy nuclear medium created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ). a large number of high energy jets are observed on both the near and away side of the @xcite collision, where jet - like structures are seen to be modified compared to p+p collisions. notably, the away side jets are found to be softer with respect to the near side and stronger with centrality. also, we find that the scale of jet modification is primarily due to the medium creation rate, in general, to the energy of the associated jets. these results are discussed in detail in the star report. 1.0 cm * program summary * _ title of program : _ star : _ + collisions between heavy nuclei + _ number of participants : _ 0.14 + _ program obtainable from : _ cpc program, i.e., detectors and tracking devices ( e.g., flash su(2 ), mpi, lris, etc. ) + _ acceptance and tracking efficiency of the star program, including statistics and acceptance, is limited by the number of collisions performed per detector and acceptance acceptance. when the system is prepared for acceptance acceptance only, as in this case jets are selected only for central collisions. + _ programming language : _ fortran77 + _ memory required to execute with typical data : _ 8.4 mb + _ no. of bits in a word : _ 4 distributed over the entire statistical lepton data set ( including environment ), including all data received at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) during a run with beam energy of 0.06 mb/yr, which included 85 % of the run at the bnl for an integration time of 160 ks. the running time was 41.5 ks for the lepton energy recovery ( fwhm ), and the reaction rate was 5.3 mb / s.
we study the exact enumeration algorithm for generating monolayer size polymers on a @xmath0-site tree. we find that the efficiency of the algorithm increases with the dimension. for example on a d - dimensional hypercube the average time required to generate one configuration of a size@xmath1 within a monte - carlo run for a size of @xittlepix polymers is exponentially smaller than the time needed to generate the same configuration in a run of the same size. there are also important differences in the structure of the genealogical tree for self - avoiding walks and lattice animals. we define a priority rule for the selection of the priority sites, which is a slight modification of the action used for the enumeration of polymers. we show that the number of possible descendant sites is exactly equal to the proportionality of the degree of a node to the total number of its perimeter sites. the iie algorithm is a simple modification of ie by adding an algorithm to determine the probability of connection between two given sites. we compare the performance of ie with the equivalent of enumeration and find that it is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than is equivalent to iie. the analysis of the network structure in this paper is inspired by the large - scale search for metropolis evolution. many materials can be studied with the help of statistical analysis tools. for instance, dna is well studied and its structure can be predicted with good accuracy for a wide range of its properties. however, it is not easy to design methods that can handle large polymers and so one has to rely on the free choice of the dimensions in which the shapes of the polymers are parametrized. there is a large variety of free parameters that can be used for this purpose, for example the particle - particle interaction length @xcite, which depends on the size of the polymer. the parameters are determined by the interplay between interactions of the particle with the surrounding solvent and the effect of the presence of impurities. since the effects of these effects are usually rather small, one can design polymers with the desired geometry and geometry. the field of polymer science has seen dramatic progress in the last few years and a lot of research is going on to study the properties of small polymers close to the threshold size of their growth. the research is driven by the need to understand the physics beyond the mathematics of a particular type of molecule. the theoretical studies of polymer properties are also quite recent and there are a number of competing ideas
we apply our recently developed generalized relativistic equipartition arguments ( barniol duran, nakar, piran 2013, hereafter ` ` paper i '' ) to the radio data of the tidal disruption event candidate, sw 1644 + 57, in the most natural context of standard synchrotron emission. we show that this is a powerful tool that reproduces the details of afterglow - like models in a simple way. it provides a robust estimate of the radius and thus the lorentz factor of the radio emitting region, and it gives a minimal total energy required to produce the observed emission. in this context, we consider a relativistically jet with a wide opening angle ( @xmath0 ) and a narrow one as possibly the only alternative to the wide jet scenario used by zelles & berger ( 2011 ). we interpret both radio and x - ray observations as being produced by the same narrow jet. although different geometries of the jet launching region are possible, we find that the geometry of the outflow that is launched by a supermassive black hole is expected to be magnetically dominated. therefore, the energy injected initially in one form ( either poynting flux or baryonic ) and later converted in the other is naturally explained by the shock interaction between the jet that has produced the x - rays and the external medium. the decrease in the energy after the radio cutoff is almost linearly related to the energy in the magnetic field and radio emitting electrons. this is independent of the shape of the spectral line and of the type of jet considered. we find an overall increase in energy and consider variations on the geometry with time and also deviations from equiparted by varying the microphysics parameters to keep the energy constant. it turns out, however, that these variations are strong functions of radius and are independent on the origin of these conditions.

we study the effect of nonlinear phonon squeezing on superconductivity in driven electron - phonon systems and propose a mechanism for an enhancement of cooper pairing in the presence of phonon nonlinearities. the dynamical transition temperature is enhanced in a wide range of electron densities due to the coupled dynamical and static features of the phonon system. the increase of the superconducting transition temperature results from a dynamical enhancement of the effective electron mass and hence the dynamic cooper pair formation rate. we calculate the underlying hamiltonian parameters and associated renormalization of the electronic dispersion. the additional nonlinearity is a periodic function of the driving frequency and can be utilized to investigate the time evolution of the system parameters. we find both a static and a non - equilibrium ( temporally modulated ) nature of the nonlinear driving effect. in the steady state, we find that the combined effect of the static displacement of the raman phonons and the periodic modulation of the dynamics leads to a temporal proximity effect that enhances pairing. we further illustrate the suggested mechanism for the enhanced pair formation by studying the competition between the increased pair formation and cooper pair breaking and find that it is not limited to a specific material. the technique can be applied to any system that can be prepared in a state of intermediate electron density, e.g., a half - filling box, a vapor cell, or a quantum dot. it has been thoroughly studied in the context of condensed matter physics and has been applied to a wide variety of materials such as cuprates, superconductors, which often display quantum criticality at low temperatures. the collective behavior of the electron and phonon degrees of freedom in confined space has been the focus of theoretical and experimental investigations in recent years. the major discoveries in this area have been spin-1/2 particle - hole excitations in graphene @xcite and the recently discovered high-@xmath0 two - dimensional topological insulators in the cuprates and organic charge - density - wave ( dos ) cuprates ( i.e., kd(2d+3d)/2s(2s)+2d)@xcite. the pair - breaking rate of electrons in these materials is controlled by the magnetic field and temperature. while the excitations of the electrons are coupled to the conduction electrons via spin - orbit ( fl ) interactions, the resulting electron energy is not spherically symmetric in time and the quasiparticle scattering rate is decoupled from the electron energy
the recently discovered minor planet 2012 xe@xmath3 is a likely venus co - orbital and it is one of the few objects currently known to be in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with the earth. its orbit is well known to involve a small semi - major axis ( @xmath390.006 au ) and a highly resonant interaction with mercury. it has previously followed a tadpole orbit in the neighbourhood of venus. we show that it is currently following an horseshoe orbit. for most of that time, it was trapped in a lagpole orbit, a configuration in which the nodes are the same as the one proposed by morais & morbidelli ( 2006 ). a small perturbation from the earth at 0.00ev or even encounters with the sun at larger distances from venus can stabilise the orbit, and propel it to a higher eccentricity, if the distance to the earth is larger than about 0.03 au. during the last 2000s, wide - field neo surveys have found thousands of objects in various states of resonance with mercury and they are all tiny neos. some of them show periodic oscillations of the node between the orbits of mercury and the earth but they also have a tendency to move in the same direction as the earth and to align themselves with the nodes of the tadpole. however, they are usually too faint to be detected. if the venus / earth relation is not symmetric, any of these objects could be members of a new dynamical group ( similar to the so - called nodal points ). we compare the present and the near - future dynamics of 2012 x ee@xsmath3 with four previously known minor planet co - orbitals : ( 322756 ) 2001 ck@xfig.

we present a stellar population analysis of 27 elliptical galaxies belonging to 4 rich, intermediate - redshift abell clusters : a115, a655, a963 and a2111. these galaxies have been already classified as ellipticals, and we study their mean luminosity - weighted ages and a number of abundance ratios of species such as fe, cn and mg ; and their relation with the velocity dispersion of the galaxies. we compare our results with those obtained by other authors in less dense environments, such as virgo and coma. we find positive trends between the abundance ratios [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / h ] for our sample of ellipticals. however, in massive clusters, this ` ` clock '' seems to be insufficiently sensitive to the environment in order to analyze the different formation timescales between different species. we also find slightly shorter star formation histories in very rich clusters : at least @xmath0 km s@xmath6, most ellipticals have formed their stars on relatively short formation histories, and, in at least 2 environments, the star formation has progressed to near or even beyond the main eddington limit. on the other hand, galaxies with very massive masses are less dense in the environment than their less massive counterparts, suggesting that the real duration of star formation is more dependent on the galaxy mass than the density of the environment. our results are in good agreement with the predictions of simple stellar population models, which also predict that ellipticals become fully assembled on a relatively short timescale, around the epoch of the massive release of cn into the ism.

here we present an analytical framework for studying the robustness of networks that include both connectivity and dependency links. when nodes fail in a network containing both types of links, two different processes occur. ( i ) connectivity links are disconnected, causing other nodes to disconnect from the network. ( ii ) failing nodes cause other nodes that depend on them to also fail even though they are still connected via connectivity links ( dependency process ). we show that the synergy between the percolation process and the dependency process leads to a cascade of failures that can fragment the entire network. for networks containing a high density of dependency links, an initial failure of even a small fraction of the network nodes disintegrates the network in a form of a first order phase transition. the transition point, characterized by the sharp peek - point of the giant cluster, can be identified by the fraction of failed nodes that are connected to the remaining nodes ( fraction of nodes in the giant component ). simulations support our analytical results by proving that networks with a broader degree distribution are more vulnerable to random failures then er networks. dependency groups of size 2, which contain more then two nodes, show a second order transition, similar to the first order transition for networks with only connectivity links. topological studies in networks have revealed that complex networks with multiple interconnected components, including the internet, the world wide web and transportation networks, are potentially very resilient to random breakdown and failure @xcite. however, it has been shown that these resilient networks are highly vulnerable to the disruption of these components due to the failure of additional nodes and the consequent disconnection of those nodes from the networks. in the last few years, there has been mounting evidence that suggests that a large fraction of electronic circuits, both in the real world and in virtual reality, are vulnerable to disruption due to dependencies. this is because the presence of dependencies in these systems tends to make their functioning highly susceptible to the random failure of some nodes and, in turn, it makes these networks much more robust against random breakdown.
we study the opposition effect in the phase curves of saturn s rings in terms of the intrinsic brightening of the inner layers, and the amount of mutual interparticle shadowing. these two processes are traditionally considered to be the same, i.e., they yield just the intrinsic contribution. however, recent hst observations of the 2005 opposition showed that the brightness increase continued all the way down to zero phase angle ( @xmath0 ), indicating that the true opposition effect is in fact stronger and narrower than expected from a quite extended particle size distribution. we quantify this observation using different models for the intrinsic opposition effect, and show that the observed opposition effect phase curves are consistent with varying only the elevation - dependent part of this effect. we derive the phase function for the full set of models, and use the observed tilt effect at different wavelengths to estimate the contribution of multiple scattering to the light. in particular, we use two different fitting formulas, a linear - exponential model, and a simplified hapke model including constructive interference between the incoming and outgoing light rays. we find that models including strong backscattering ( cb ), as well as a shadow hiding mechanism ( sh ), can match the observations extremely well, and that a broad scale height distribution is necessary to match the opposition phase curve observations. finally, we compare our theoretical model results to the observations, and conclude that both mechanisms are important for the opposition brightening, but that they have distinct roles in brightening the inner ring. specifically, the b ring tilt effect ( the reflectivity increases with elevation by 30 % for the ground based geometries ), is traditionally interpreted as resulting from increased multiple scattering at larger elevation angles, but we show that this effect can also result from a reduced amount of multiple shadowing if the size distribution is broadened. the fact that the tilt effect undergoes a steepening with elevation is, however, not caused by this increased shadowing, but is due to an increase in the effective volume density of shadow cylinders.
we have studied the nature of the optical continuum and the stellar population in the nuclear region of the seyfert 2 galaxies mrk348, mrrk573, ngc1358 and mr k1210 using long - slit spectroscopic observations. in a previous work we found that none of these galaxies present significant dilutions in the equivalent widths w s of the absorption lines as compared with those of the extranuclear spectra from the bulge of the same galaxy, as it would be expected if a featureless continuum was present at the nuclei in the proportions found in previous works. here we extend our investigation with a more statistical approach, by including in our analysis the contribution of young and intermediate age stars to the nuclear spectra. we find that the young stellar component in these galaxies contributes with less than 20 % of the total flux in the optical waveband at @xmath0 = 5500, and that the continuum reddening factor is very similar to that found in the elliptical galaxy ngc6814 ( after correcting for the effect of the intervening starlight ). we also find no evidence for a significant contribution from the blue agn component to the uv continuum in any of the four galaxies. we suggest that the difference in the level of intrinsic polarization between the nuclear and stellar fluxes is essentially due to the ` ` dilution by fc2 effect '', which we associate with the young stars. this effect seems to be particularly important in starburst galaxies, where the starburst activity tends to wash out the scattered flux and to produce a blue continuum with a larger equivalent width than the continuum produced by the old population. a hypothesis that we propose to explain the lack of dilution in the absorption features of young stars is able to account for the results of our population synthesis analysis in the framework of the unified model. the increase of the intrinsic polarization in star - forming regions with respect to no polarization is likely to be a result of the overpredicting of the strengths of broad lines predicted by the theoretical models of cid fernandes & terlevich.
this paper is the cumulative exposition of a series of preliminary results reported in various scientific meetings and partly published in nemirprl06 and in @xcite. it concerns an important role of the fusion and breakdown processes of vortex loops in the dynamics of a network of one - dimensional singularities which appear in various physical systems. as examples we would point out out vortices in quantum fluids both in superfluid helium and cosmic strings. we would use the generalized wiener distribution, which allows to take into account the finite curvature. the ` ` kinetic '' boltzmann type equation for distribution function @xmath0 is obtained and we specify the coefficients, entering it. using this equation we obtain a stationary solution of the master kinetic equation. we show that the vortex tangle is formed due to kinetics of colliding vortex loops. in more realistic situation of nonzero temperature connection between interline space the negative flux appears when the break down of loops prevails and the cascade - like process of generation of smaller and larger loops forms. unlike the previous case of the direct cascade, there is no apparent mechanism for disappearance of the very large loops. on the contrary, they frequently merge and split, therefore these recombination processes are the fastest and the basic approach to study of superfluid turbulence should be grounded on consideration of a set of randomly merging loops. + * key words and phrases : * vortex tangles, recombination, vortex line density, kelvin waves, turbulence, planckian dynamics + * mathematics subject classification ( 2000 ) : * 60g55 ( primary ), 60g30 ( secondary ). * corresponding author, ` ` m. a. kuriyagawa, a. ikeda, k. matsumoto, t. tanimura, i. matsuura, and s. nagatsuka, a ` ` novel approach to the study of the evolution of networks of chaotic sets of lines '', j. phys. b - at. mol. inst. czechosl., ser. i. laboratoire de physique thorique ( umr 8627 ), universitat autnoma de barcelona, 08193 bellaterra ( barcelona ), spain. + e - mail address : m.k@phys.barcelona.ac.br http://www.harmony.berkeley.edu/@xmath1stumpf/
we report on the correlated spectral and timing properties of the new x - ray transient sax j1711.63808 during its first four observations with the _ rxte_/pca. the source is the brightest source in the 320 kev energy range and has relatively hard power - law spectra with a tail extending up to 6.5 kev. during all four observations the source was in a softer, softer, state, in which the x - rays show a broad band - limited noise component and a narrow qpo. the count rate and flux of the source decreased monotonically with time, which is in agreement with simple accretion theory. a correlation between the break frequency and the qpo frequency ( i.e., the frequency of the break at the soft end of the power spectrum ) is found, as would be expected if the source harbors a black hole. this behavior is also seen in the state - dependent power spectra of persistent neutron - star low - mass xmxb ( bhxb ) systems, and it is likely that the observed state behavior is a consequence of mass accretion rate changes. however, in contrast to these two systems, the count and the flux of xte j1550564 are tightly correlated with the spectral behavior, indicating that the source flux was not much higher than expected from the summing of the different state - transitions, and that the total amount of source flux could be hidden at luminosities above 20 kev in the bhcd limit. furthermore, we found that the rapid variability of sax jeng et al. ( 2001 ) 7.03.3115 is very similar to that of other bhcs, and the observed different states can be identified with the island state ( the soft state ) and the lower banana branch ( the hard state ). an upper limit to the temperature of the @xmath0 kelvin - cooled state could be inferred from the spectral data of observation three and four, but we can not rule out a possible neutron star component. the normalization of the count frequency ( between 0.2 and 2.0 hz ) between the soft and hard bands is not a strong correlation with the hard component.
the existence of a cut - off for the maximum attainable energy / momentum in non - relativistic quantum mechanics, hereafter compton wavelength, is argued. this may be interpreted in terms of the ` compton - schwarzschild correspondence ', which identifies the minimum attainable width of a higher - dimensional wave packet with respect to the @xmath0 spatial extent of the planck length scale. we suggest an interpretation of this as requiring the minimum possible positional uncertainty over measurements in any number of dimensions, in particular, for particles in spacetimes in which compactification is compactified on a single length scale smaller than the compactification radius. if, on the other hand, there are spherically symmetric in the three large dimensions but maximally asymmetric ( i.e. pancaked ) in the low and intermediate dimensions, then the effective compton length does not scale with mass and is independent of planck mass, so that there can be no tev quantum gravity regime. this scenario is supported by a recent observation that the hawking temperature of a quantum mechanical particle in a 3-dimensional planckian spacetime may be related to the effective wavelength of a black hole in a 4-dimensional space - time. in this scenario, the low - energy properties of quantum mechanical particles and black holes can be related via the compton temperature of the black hole, whose mass is localized within a _ maximum _ radius, whereas the energetic properties of a particle are independent of its mass. this provides a unified expression for the effective length scale, which scales with mass if and only if there exist compactified extra spatial directions in the heisenberg uncertainty principle. we also discuss how this relates to the standard uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the uncertainty principle is not an operator relation and that it may be based on extended de broglie relations. all these results are in the light of two main issues. first, it is argued that the choice of a low - dimensional or a hyperbolic fixed point or a high - dimensional fixed point, depending on the initial conditions, can make a judgment on the existence of black holes more difficult to make. second, the agreement between the quantum theory of quantum plasmas and that of condensed matter on macroscopic scales can be used to constrain the dimensions in which a particle can have an effective residence in the universe, thereby implying that there may be a location for the quantum mechanical black hole. finally, we show that the lower - dimensional uncertainty principle breaks the symmetry between particles
the detection of weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) signals via the direct detection of sub-100 kev recoils of wimps on detector nuclei is limited by the requirement of a deep underground laboratory to shield cosmic - ray backgrounds. such a deep laboratory provides a powerful ` smoking gun'; a directional detector needs only of order ten events to differentiate a wimp signal from isotropic background radiation for all halo models considered. we study the application of non - parametric tests, developed for the analysis of circular data, to the recoil data of a tpc - based directional wimp detector with a 2-d read - out. we find that if the signals are unambiguously sub - 100 kev, then between 10 and 30 events, depending on the spatial resolution and the velocity dispersion, required to reject isotropy of the reduced angle distribution ( with the direction of motion of the sun subtracted ) can be detected with of order a hundred events, regardless of whether the sense of the motions and distributions is known. in general the isotropy tests are applied to data with reduced angle distributions in the meridian and east - west planes, and in the horizon plane. for axial data the increase in number of events required is even larger, at least an order of magnitude. we also calculate the recoil angles required to detect a wolf - rayet ( ghz ) signal using the standard halo model, taking into account the time dependent conversion between the lab and galactic coordinate frames. assuming a flat local wimp velocity distribution produces a peak recoil direction slightly deviating from the solar motion direction, @xmath0, which can be investigated by a variety of tests. particularly suitable for zero - velocity tests is shown to give rise to anisotropy in the range of low, but non - zero events required to clear out isotropy in lab backgrounds. pacs : 12.60.-m ; 95.30.+x ; 98.80.ly -0.3 cm cosmology : theory ; dark matter ; particle physics ; large - scale structure of the universe 0.2 cm 16.cm 17.cm -1.0 cm
we examine the prospects for pop iii star clusters to be discovered in the reionized universe as a result of the epoch of photoheating by the photoionizing background. in particular, we show that the suppression of star formation in dark matter ( dm ) minihaloes during the early stages of reionization can lead to the existence of unenriched dm haloes with masses @xmath0 10@xmath11 m@xma5 at redshifts 3 - 6 which may host pop iii clusters. we derive an upper limit for the abundance of such clusters due to the degree to which galactic winds enrich the igm with metals, as well as on the minimum halo mass necessary for their formation. a molecule - dissociating, so - called lyman - werner ( lw ) background radiation field can quickly enrich the gas in these haloes, depending on the speed of the winds and on how quickly the metals are mixed into the pristine haloes. if the winds are sufficiently rapid, however, the formation of pop iii stars may be completely prevented in halo progenitors which contain initial supernovae ( sne ). in the absence of large - scale galactic winds, the only ways these clusters may be detectable in future surveys are likely to be within the reach of the _ james webb space telescope _ ( e - elt ), as has been shown by nagao et al. ( 2008 ). it is also possible that the extended press - schechter formalism, applied to perturbed dm universes, could allow these clusters to form preferentially within the environments of the descendants of the first galaxies, at least up to redshift 0.5. finally, we point out that it is possible that moderate - luminosity star clusters ( pop iii ) may be uniquely discovered in high - redshift dm minihalo environments, such as the h ii regions around the first dwarf galaxies at @x0 @xik1 20, if the stellar imf may be top - heavy ( i.e. of the order of 10 percent ) or if the star formation efficiency can be significantly higher than the current upper limit on the pop iii imf. upcoming observations of these regions with the _ elt will allow to test these theoretical upper limits.
background : : the kuo - sheng nuclear power plant has been chosen as a target for a low - energy neutrino - electron experiment using a arrays of csi(tl ) crystal scintillating crystals to study the effects of radioactive isotopes in the @xmath0 decay series. high - purity germanium crystals have been produced and characterized in the last two years using high - dynamic range 8-bit flash analog - to - digital - convertor ( fadc ) modules. the crystalline preparation and detector technology has been adopted for a detector array of 2 kg in mass and a data sample of 40 crystals. _ in situ _ studies have been performed on a subset of the crystals using the ks detector at the 1725 kg - day level taking with a versatile electronics and data acquisition system for a suited for low - background experiments. six isotopes have been measured, corresponding to the isotopes @xcite : nai, naiq, cdwo, cdsoft, gso, boron - loaded polyethylene, caf, baf, bose - einstein condensate and csiarray. the measured activities are roughly divided into two classes : single- and double - charged cases. the first class comprises all isotopes free of charge contamination and the second class comprises those which are contaminated by radiation from their long - lived parent isotopes. the events are identified by using correlated pseudoscalar and time - series radio - loud oscillations. the quasi - simultaneous events are separated into two groups providing information on the energy and the longitudinal z - position of the events. two - dimensional patterns are generated from these signals. two types of quenched pulses were investigated, i.e., single - charged and two - charged double - charge pulsed events. the pulse shapes for the two classes of events exhibited different rates of evolution, which can be related to the different fractional contributions to the total recoil energy of the target particles, and the relative contributions of the two groups. the data were analyzed using the qf@xmath780 model. methods were devised to determine the background levels and the quenching factor from these measurements. results are presented.
the radio through tev spectrum of sgr a east is modeled in a self - consistent manner as arising from a population of relativistic electrons and positrons colliding with the ambient proton distribution. we show that, in this situation, the @xmath0 ergs radio emission is due to bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering of the central ir and uv photons by a compact region of medium - density dust at the galactic center. this region may be a supernova remnant ( snr ), although the presence of such a system is itself a signature of the superposition of several components that occur in a variety of physical processes at different stages of evolution of the snr. in this paper, we work with the hypothesis that the egret bump observed in the radio spectrum is due primarily to a beam produced by @xcite pions. these pion decays may also be the origin of the inferred energetics of the radio emitting shell, but the dominant component here is likely to be due to collisions of these particles with ambient protons. we also show that the electron and positron distributions inferred from radio observations may be consistent with a steady - state distribution resulting from synchrotron - induced maser injection, cascade collisions producing secondary particles which feed back into the system, and inverse cd radio losses. in either case, the positron emission associated with these collisions is expected to be weakly nonthermal, most likely being produced in shock - heated dust associated with the remnant s black hole. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # 1= # 1,#2,#3,#4 # 1equation ( [ # 1 ] ) # 1 ( # 1 ) # 2 ( # 2 ) # 3 ( # # 1)@xmath5 # 1figure [ #1 ] # 1 = = = by -10pt = cmbx10 scaled 2 to * searching for the energizing particles responsible for a powerful radio burst of radiation * + + _ ( a ) observatory for space research, planetary systems laboratory, + code 662, los alamos, new mexico _ + ( b ) universities space research association, department of astronomy, university of miami, + p. o. largo, instituto superior tcnico, + largo alto, av. rovisco pais, p. edgario de abajo, lisboa, it
we present the results of our observations at millimeter wavelengths of the ab aur system with the iram 30-m antenna and the plateau de bure interferometer during 2000 - 2002. nine different molecular species in a dozen rotational transitions of co, c@xmath0o, cs, hcn, hnc, hco@xday1, dco@xsmath1, sio, and hco2co were detected. our interferometric observations revealed the presence of a dozen spiral arms, a dark lane, an underlying circular inhomogeneous structure, and a diffuse spherical envelope at @xmath439 au. as a by - product of this study, we obtained the most accurate determination of the physical, chemical, and dynamical parameters ( density enhancement, mass, radius, and enclosed mass ) of an ab aur - system to date. we apply a two - dimensional non - lte line radiative transfer code to translate the calculated molecular abundances of cs, co, hn, hcnc, and sio to the corresponding synthetic beam - convolved single - dish and interferomet spectra. we compare the observed and synthesized emission lines in a systematic way in order to determine the model parameters consequently. iterating these three stages of the modeling, we find the best - fit model of the a aur system for which the observed intensities, widths, and profiles of the co(2 - 1 ), ( 3 - 2 ), and ( 4 - 5 ) lines are well reproduced. we find that the model reproduces the essential features of the observed spectra : presence of clump - like profiles and the characteristic density e(b - v ) distribution along the lines of sight. the enclosed mass and the mass fraction of dust grains in the disk are relatively unaffected by the constrained parameters. for both the disk and envelope models, the time - dependent abundances and column densities of observationally important molecules were calculated for 3 myr of the evolution with the gas - grain umist95 chemical network supplied by dust surface reactions, reactions of deuterium fractionation, and co and h2 shielding. in general, our modeling results strongly suggest that local density enhancement in the nearby envelope plays a major role in regulating the dynamical evolution of the system. we discuss what the future prospects of this system are for its further evolution and conclude that it will remain a class ii object for the next few million years.
in the context of cellular differentiation, it has been proposed that pluripotency, an emergent statistical property of a population of cells, is a marker of their differentiation status. however, since these molecular signatures can discriminate cells of distinct differentiation stages from each other, there is no single quantitative measure that can correctly place a sample within the global differentiation hierarchy. using data from the stem cell matrix, we confirm this for 12 of the 13 notch pathway genes. we further demonstrate that network entropy, a relatively recently introduced system s property of cell samples, provides a sensitive and general measure of the undifferentiated state of cells. we show that it is a robust quantifier of the pluripotent state of a cell sample, and that it predicts a higher cellular heterogeneity in cancer cells compared to ordinary cancer cells. finally, we test our hypothesis by computing sample - specific network entropies for a large number of gene expression data sets relevant to cell differentiation, reprogramming and cancer, encompassing over 800 samples, including cell - lines and primary tissue. _ * significance * _ network entropy is a highly accurate tool for characterising the differentiate status of cells in diverse physical and biological contexts. it can be thought of as an approximate measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, which varies with cell type and level of proliferation @xcite. thus, the entropy rate gives a steady - state average measure of fluctuation in signaling information flow over the network. to facilitate comparison of data obtained from different expression arrays, we also compute the network entropy rate of a sample from its genome - wide expression profile. + based on the robustness of the measure in relation to cell - proliferation indices, we suggest that it may be considered an intermediate and more general tool for identifying cell types located further down the differentiation hierarchy, irrespective of normal or cancer physiology. + several recent studies have made claims about the cellular diversity in terms of cell - line intensities, network entropy and other measures of cellular heterogeneity. for example, it was demonstrated that terminally differentiated cells exhibit significantly higher network entropy than terminally un differentiated cells @xcitethat would imply that cancer is characterized by high levels of network entropy. in cancer, hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiated progeny are found to have a high network entropy compared to their normal counterparts. this is in agreement with the view that healthy cells are characterized by relatively low levels of cellular heterogeneity. in contrast, cancer patients, particularly those with healthy cells, tend to have higher network energies and a more pronounced level of
we compare the gas fraction scaling relations observed in the population of galaxies with detectable gas with those predicted by current semi - analytic disk formation models, in order to understand how gas accretion and quenching processes operate in galaxies. we find that the hi gas fraction and the h@xmath0 mass fraction predicted by the models are in good agreement with the data for galaxies with redshifts between 0.04 and 0.05, and with stellar masses in the range @xmath1. the ` ` cold '' gass survey is not able to account for the gas fractions observed in large samples of galaxies. the hi / co ( 1 - 0 ) line from the iram 30-m telescope and the hi line from arecibo are the best tools for measuring the atomic and molecular gas content of galaxies, and for constraining the amount of gas that is in the form of stars because the separation of star - forming and quiescent galaxies is too large. the models also fail to reproduce the observed sharp threshold below which all galaxies have a measurable gas component, in the sense that the gas mass fraction _ drops _ in the same way in the cold gass data. in answer to the second question, we conclude that the models do not _ track the evolution of the atomic - to - molecular gas ratio in galaxies as a function of stellar mass or galaxy stellar mass surface density _, and that the current observational data are _ not _ consistent with the models. this is particularly true if stellar mass is considered as a third parameter in the hydrostatic phase of the stellar disk, which is generally thought to be appropriate in models of how stars form in the early universe. our analysis elucidates which aspects of the models work well, and which ones fail. we also show that the transition between the population with _ cold _ and _ hot _ gas, as defined in the literature, occurs without a detectable gas component in post - starburst galaxies, which have high stellar surface densities. this implies that the black hole growth in these galaxies is not driven by accretion of gas, but is instead the result of a recent interaction.
we present the results of a deep, wide - field ( @xmath0 ) near - infrared survey of the carina cluster, based on _ chandra _ and _ spitzer _ data. the survey was motivated by the fact that young stars are thought to be the major contributors to the massive star formation process in the central region of the galaxy, and a good determination of their basic stellar parameters is essential for understanding the feedback effects of the massive stars on the formation and evolution of low - mass objects. the analysis of the x - ray data alone provides very limited insight into the properties of the young stellar populations in the cnc ; only a deep hst imaging survey can yield a reasonably clean and complete sample of young stars. using the hawk - i 5-meter telescope, we identify a total of 1578 infrared sources, which are likely to be foreground or background sources, of which the vast majority are unclassified. however, we also find that a significant fraction ( 1516 ) have likely counterparts in the more extended 2mass catalog, raising the total number of infrared sources in this field by a factor of 10. we use these 2mass counterparts to calculate stellar masses and metallicities, and compare the estimated masses to those of the probable background sources. we find that the mass - to - light ratio of the unclassified sources is quite similar to that of the general stellar population in the entire cnc ( down to the low mass limit ), whereas the slope of the klf is somewhat shallower, in agreement with recent studies of the orion nebula. we do not find significant evidence for systematic differences in the shape of the infrared luminosity function ( imf ) between carina and other star forming regions ( e.g., *??? * ), except for the _ infrared excess _, which is a tracer of circumstellar material surrounding young stellar objects. there is no evidence ( yet ) for a significant population of unobscured ( or shadowed ) high - mass stars. our results suggest that the imf in carina is consistent ( at least down to a few myr ) with that observed in the field imf, since evolved be stars, carbon stars, planetary nebulae, star - forming galaxies, and agn can easily be distinguished from the background.
the monte carlo simulations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) in an x - ray flux - limited sample of nearby galaxy clusters are used to quantify the uncertainties in the predictions of the inverse compton optical depth ( @xmath0 ) for a volume complete sample of 242 abell clusters. with the aim of quantifying these uncertainties, we have analyzed rosat pspc data on 22 of these clusters and quantified the errors in the rosat 5.5-meter spectral energy distribution ( seds ) on behalf of the entire sample. using a cluster - by - cluster modeling strategy, we find that of the 31 clusters included in our sample, which are complete at the 0.12.4 kev level in the ovro all sky survey ( rass ), 10 have baryon masses or upper limits consistent with icm intracluster medium ( icm ) models derived from einstein and rosat observations, while the remaining 21 have lower bound corresponding to icm models. we do not find significant evidence for the seds of any of the 21 non - recoverable clusters. using the density profiles derived from the combined rosat / ovro data on a sample of 44 clusters, we assess the statistical significance of the combined sample and find that within the uncertainties we can conclusively rule out the presence of significant substructure in the cluster gas. with this method we present predictions for the beam - averaged optical depth of the near - future advanced cmb interferometer ( acbar ) experiment. these predictions are robust with respect to the measurement errors, and are unaffected by the specific observing strategy employed to carry out the observations. we also present comparisons of our results with those obtained by other authors. we find our results are in good agreement with those of @xcite, who find an excess of soft counts in our simulated seds towards a478, but find that central cooling flow emission enrico fermi levels are insufficient to explain the observed seds. we will combine our data with the observations of myers et al. and produce a summary of the best - fit icm model predictions for this and other clusters.
we establish a new aspect of the ginzburg - landau - schrdinger theorem on the behavior of nonlinear yang - mills functions in one and more than one spatial dimension, thereby obtaining a nontrivial behavior of the eigenfunction of the operator @xmath0 in the presence of a barrier at the origin. the necessary condition for the existence of the qm-1 operator, that is, a black box self - adjoint operator, close to the laplacian and having analytic coefficients near infinity, is given by a question of @xcite : [ t:1d ] is there an approximate quantization condition on the normal modes of the unperturbed potential of the black box operator? since it is well known that the answer is yes, let us first give a derivation of the expected values of this condition in one dimension. then we will consider an approximate term of the galdoshapek law, and we will give a correction to this result in the other direction. indeed, it is crucial to distinguish the two cases in the following section. the first case ( *??? *, 8.3 ) is a detailed study of the sobolev spaces of hawking operators. the second case is a generalization of the action of a local field theory in terms of quasimodal potentials of black boxes. the role of the noise is played by a control term, and in particular by a bloch function. in both cases, if the cell number of the control operator is larger than a critical value, the resulting eigenvalue of the controlling ( nonlinear operator ) is sufficiently large. it is proved that the noise has a nonzero probability of being positive or negative. both cases ( as well as the special case of a negative potential ) have eigenvalues in the realm of analytical functions, and this is the case where the analysis is based on real numbers and not on kolmogorov s lemma 2.1. the use of _ local _ fields turns out to be ( on the one hand)$ ], and on the other hand, leads to the so - called _ operator - black box duality property_. one of the most interesting problems in the theory of quantum noise is to determine whether a given quantum harmonic oscillator has the correct " normal mode of the oscillator, i.e., whether the set of all harmonic oscillators in a given dimension is quantized in the appropriate sense to have a given
we discuss the homology of the configuration spaces of finite graphs. in connection with this the following statement is useful : [ euler ] let @xmath0 be a finite connected graph which is not homeomorphic to the circle. then the euler characteristic of @xfig.1 from @xcite is onto ( by proposition [ epi ] ). the number of edges of the graph not incident to the 14-dimensional homology not specified by the vertex group is the square of the set of all ordered pairs of edges. if the graph is surjective then this intersection form is onto the fundamental group. by the knneth theorem this form measures intersection of cycles in the graph. we prove that it is equal to the intersection form of the intersection tree. this result is a consequence of proposition [ thm ] which characterizes the aspherical geometry of planar surfaces. we also discuss the connection of this result with the well - known kuratowski graphs. our discussion may also help in answering a question of s. cappell and r.s. chuang : what is the best way to deform the configuration space of a finite graph, i.e. which is its deformation retraction into a pair of loops? in answer, we show that the answer is yes but there is an alternative way to do this and it is to change the graph s homology group. this is equivalent to saying that one of the fundamental groups of a graph is the ring of symmetric subgroups of the total group on the space of all smooth curves. the interest in this question is due to the development of the theory of infinite - dimensional topological invariants. the study of the topology of configuration spaces is partially motivated by the deformation of finite polyhedra by using vertex groups. a lot of work has been done on this question in the literature and a lot is still going on. however the results in this paper may be of relevance for the understanding of the cell - complexes of graphs, in particular the cell complexes of the laplacian and some related questions. in recent years there has been great interest in the intersection forms of finite graph configuration spaces. the main result in this area is the proof of the above and a more general result in anti - deligne - zakharov topology ( section 5.4 ). consider a finite non - degenerate infinite chain of alternating simplex and simplex - loops. for each vertex group the intersection of the loops is
we investigate the temporal and spatial response of bragg forward scattering to temporally short incident and laterally confined pulses of radiation. for a 0.1-mm diamond crystal, we find that the predominant temporal profile of forward scattering depends strongly on the crystal thickness, and we derive simple analytic expressions for the time response under the commonly used assumption of spontaneous scattering. using these relations, we derive conditions under which the forward - going wave system satisfying bragg s condition must produce a trailing power pulse with effective seed power greater than 10@xmath0 mw, even if the initial incident pulse is very short. we illustrate our methods with results for a 1-gw single - channel sase pulse, where the exact relation for the seeding wake depends only on the parameter @xmath1. in the frequency domain, our results are in general agreement with the theoretical predictions of sase, but we find differences in the power statistics between the transmitted and reflected waves, which we investigate. forward scattering, pulse - propagation in crystals, sase scattering 2.5 mm * program summary * _ manuscript title : _ bragg scattering in crystals : theory and numerical results _ + _ authors : _ y. akahane, t. asano, m. arikawa, s. kobayashi, takashi, h. hagino, k. koshiba, and t. mori, ` ` crystals as a platform for efficient energy harvest and storage _, '' phys. rev. b * 84 *, 041302(r ) ( 2010 ). _ program obtainable from : _ http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.55.09.2633 + _ licensing provisions : _ this work is distributed under the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction of published work, provided the original author and source are credited. + _ programming language : _ fortran 95, c++ + _ computer : _ any computer that can run the program ( tested on linux and windows ) + _ operating systems : _ sunos 4.1 and os / hsl + _ ram : _ 10 mbytes + _ number of processors used : _ 1 + _ supplementary material : _ manuals, websites, databases, and figures ( available at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0370157314003871 + _ keywords : _ scattering, bragg, monochromator
background : : measurements of @xmath0o(@xmath1 ) have been made in an effort to determine information on single - particle wave functions and spectroscopic factors. calculations were performed assuming one - photon exchange, current conservation and zero electron mass. the reaction was performed in parallel kinematics with the exchange currents calculated within a continuum model. results : : the reaction is well described by the recoil corrected continuum shell model ( rccsm ). it produces wave functions that are antisymmetric and contain no spurious components. it also produces near perfect agreement of reduction factors for responses and cross sections for the ( 460 mev / c, 100 mev ) and ( 172 mev/c ) experiments. a change of the model to a narrower recoil potential ( rpa ) was required in order to reproduce the data. reactions were also performed in the pion - exchange part of the two - body potential. conclusions : : this analysis shows that the mec contribution is small and that there is no significant dependence on the model parameters. this result puts in question the conclusions of previous optical model calculations, where a small contribution from mec was predicted. the conclusions in this work are based on a non - relativistic optical model calculation, and do not depend on whether or not the correct current is included. therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions from this experiment. the # 1#2#3#4#5#6#1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 dftt, institut fr theoretische physik, p.o. box 513, f-8614 mnchen, germany pacs numbers : 72.25.dw, 72.10.+q, 71.10.-z, 75.10bt 2 cern, ph.d., department of physics, theory division, + university of maryland, + college park, md 20742, usa
we demonstrate a pseudopotential for the repulsive coulomb interaction that may offer a speedup of @xmath0 times over existing dmc calculations. we use diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations of the ground state energy of the lithium and beryllium atoms as a benchmark system to evaluate the performance of the pseudopotentials. the three - body error is removed with the removal of the correlation between the jastrow factor and the electron - electron separation radius. we find a numerical test result for an error of order chemical accuracy of @xcite, and discuss the potential for this observable to speedup calculations in many other real - life systems. in condensed matter physics the accuracy is typically limited by the number of electrons present in a given system, typically three to four electrons. this limit is significantly reduced with the advent of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ), which allows the use of many - body interactions for the computation of complex models. the high accuracy comes at the cost of being cautious with respect to the calculation of individual atoms, with better knowledge about the systematic errors in the calculations than is feasible with classical physics. the electron energy uncertainty is typically several orders of magnitude larger than that due to the complexity of the system, making it prohibitively difficult to perform quantum computations with low computational cost. for example, structure prediction calculations require an order of magnitude more accuracy, for example to correctly capture the motion of stars during close encounters. there are a number of different techniques that are capable of accelerating calculations, such as density functional theory ( dft ), variational method ( vmc ), truncated ci, coupled cluster theory ( ci ), and mller - plesset theory. however, each method can only address a small fraction of the error in the final state, typically one or two percent. to reach the ultimate goal of clean calculations an understanding of the physics of the electron, atom, atom - atom interactions is necessary. this is because the full relativistic lagrangian is impossible in the inhomogeneous electron gas ( heg ). the development of effective dipole interaction techniques and the refinement of the formalism for vmc calculations will be crucial to the realization of these systems. the progress has been made possible thanks to the emergence of accurate scattering states for incident wave vectors and angular momentum channels found in an electron gas, for which the conventional berryllium atom is known to have an effective dipolar interaction. it is also possible to develop
the existence of an efficient nonradiative decay mechanism for dark excitons is well established. a theoretical model of exciton - exciton recombination consistent with experimental data was developed and applied to explain the power law decay in time resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes. the model was fully consistent with the experimental data. it predicts a quantum yield of 0.05 percent for a sample with less than one exciton per nanotube. further calculations show that this rate can increase linearly with the number of free charge carriers. the quantum yield is sensitive to the effective temperature of the exciton population and the materials that are involved. these calculations also suggest that the lifetime of an exciton is on the order of a few nanoseconds. it is a widely accepted concept in quantum mechanics that most physical processes are mediated by multiple scattering processes. the simplest example is the generation of mass for outgoing electrons, but there are many other processes that contribute to the scattering amplitude. among these are uv conduction processes, including uv polarization, photoemission, photo - dissociation, and uv fluorescence. the latter two processes are responsible for the heavy element excitations, leading to significant quantum yields, such as the heavy fermion condensate ( hfss ). a major new process that has received much attention is the auger process, which is an example of quantum decay dominated by pure exciton auger decay. this process was first proposed in 2004 by wang _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 75 *, 84 ( 1978 ) ] and has since been studied by many authors. it involves a two - body interaction and involves a minimal number of scattering processes, while the former are limited by the latter. although it has been studied for several decades, there is still no rigorous theoretical description of it. the key idea in the current unified description of auger recombination is that of two electrons interacting with each other but with a point contact interaction, giving a total scattering amplitude that is proportional to the sum of the squared masses of the incoming and outgoing particles. the method has two distinct advantages : first, it can take advantage of the fact that the coulomb repulsion leads to efficient recombination of electrons and holes, allowing for a higher exciton density. at low exciton densities, there are several reasons why this type of recombination should be inefficient : ( 1 ) the energy and momentum of the outgoing electrons can be
we present new results on the abundance ranges for extremely metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 3.5 ) in the ultra - faint dwarf botes i and dwarf spheroidal galaxies segue 1 and find that they are consistent with a luminosity - metallicity relation similar to that observed for the galaxy s halo giants ; [ c / fe ] = + 2.3. of particular interest is the report of the first high - resolution, high - signal - to - noise radial velocity measurements for four stars in the field of segue1, which we believe are the counterparts of the ` ` unmixed '' giants of the galactic halo. we find that the spread in carbon abundance is large, extending out to at least 1.5 times the milky way s nominal half - light radius. we identify four stars as radial - velocity member candidates, one of which has a somewhat offset velocity from the systemic systemic velocity. of the other three stars, two have high - quality radial velocities and one has an offset velocity that is consistent with being a globular cluster member. in fact, two of these stars appear to be the quadruple - lined spectroscopic satellites of a small, low - luminosity sgr. we have also identified a high - redshift ` ` jump '' star as a likely cluster member, based on a preliminary comparison of his / her radial velocity to that of a spectroscopically - confirmed planetary nebula companion. we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of all four stars and conclude that two of them are carbon - rich, two are extremely metal poor, and one is extremely carbon - poor with an ar / ew difference of only 0.18dex. for the third star, the abundances of several elements, including carbon, agree with model predictions of continuous mixing of ejecta ejected by the previous generations of supernovae, while the third member has a large spread in abundances, consistent with sustained star formation continuing to the very lowest luminosities. the existence of such clusters implies that hierarchical galaxy formation models require that the few dwarf galaxies currently found within the halo of the galaxy should be short - lived debris from an initally more luminous state. we discuss the implications of these results for the formation, chemical enrichment, and evolution of such systems. the most important implication is that these systems are likely the building blocks of the outer halo galaxy s disk, rather than the remnants of an earlier epoch of star formation.
we present a detailed study of the diffuse x - ray emission in a sample of 10 approximately edge - on spiral galaxies ( 7 starburst galaxies, 3 normal spirals ) spanning the full range of star formation activity found in spiral galaxies. because the sample is not large ( @xmath0 ), we present a variety of quantitative measures of the spatial extent, spectral hardness, and shape of ( extra - planar ) diffuse emission. for each galaxy we provide a detailed description of the data, including velocity, spatial and spectral structure, and discuss the implications of each for the original dataset. we find that ( a ) the extent of diffuse emission in the ( b ) host galaxy correlates with the star formation rate per unit area in the underlying disk, such that larger galaxies host more massive stars. ( c ) the total amount of soft thermal emission ( including but not entirely due to starburst - driven superwinds ) correlates best ( within a given distribution function ) with the the size of the host galaxy. ( d ) the radial extent and the azimuthal mean distance of the emitting gas are also well correlated with the galaxy size. ( e ) we interpret each of these results ( in terms of a theoretical model of superbubble blow out ) in the context of the return of mechanical energy to the interstellar medium from massive stars, which can be modeled as an acis - s=10 supernova. we demonstrate that a common spectral model can successfully account for the properties of all three normal galaxies in this sample, based on a ratio of the oxygen - to - iron abundance ratio within a molecular cloud of gas with a disk geometry. we argue that a good fraction of supernovae ( superbubbles ) blow out, which is favored by current observational data, can be used to argue against a single - bubble or blow - out mechanism being a dominant part of the accretion process onto the disk. we suggest future tests of this model, such as possible use of the observed cosmic microwave background to constrain the velocity and spatial extent of the blowout, or use it to test the accuracy of standard theoretical blowout models.
the strong and rapid x - ray variability of many seyfert galaxies, and the similarity in power - spectral properties of black hole x - rays binaries ( bhxrbs ), raises the possibility that their variability time - scales are scale with the central black hole mass. to be able to test this hypothesis, we need to know the shape of the broadband power spectra of agn. we present long - term _ rxte _ lightcurves for 4 agn, mcg-6 - 30@xmath0, ngc 5506 - 5548, and ngc 3516, covering a broad range of break frequencies. power spectral models fitted to the data show power - law breaks which vary between 1 and 6 hz with an average break frequency of @xmath1 hz, and a low - frequency break which varies between 0.04 and 0.4 hz. the power spectrum has two peaks, one at 1.3 hz and the other at 5 decades down the frequency axis. the break frequencies are consistent with what we expect if they are produced in the same part of the brain as the physical processes which power the variability. if so, it means that the physical mechanisms responsible for variability in agn are the same as those those which power xrbs. reducing the model size will allow us to constrain it with 95 % confidence. we use our power spectral measurements to estimate the black hole masses of the agn in our sample and discuss some of the implications of our results. the results show that the flattening we find is in good agreement with what is expected from simple models of the power - spectrum break. it is encouraging that the simple models can fit the data well, and that a simple scaling in the break frequency between the high and low frequencies naturally describes the power spectral flattening. however, we caution that while this flattening may be detected in some sources, it can not be unambiguously proven by observations on the whole sky.
in this paper, we discuss the problem of variational regularization of inverse and ill posed problems on closed riemannian manifolds. the analysis ( stability, convergence, and rates ) follows from standard results on convex regularization and is reviewed. the main contribution of this paper concerns the numerical analysis of such regularization methods and the numerical implementation. moreover, three inverse problems appearing in non - destructive evaluation and computer vision are discussed.

a sample of compact symmetric objects ( csos ), whose double - sided radio components are thought to be hot spots generated by relativistic jets in the ambient medium, is presented. some of them are found to have a core between the two outer components which are optically thick and double in nature. in reasonable agreement with the observed data, we find that the average radio luminosity of these objects increases as their size ( projected linear size ) increases along the first kiloparsec of their evolution. assuming that the jets feeding the hot spots are decelerating towards the point where they are expected to collide with the external medium, our theory predicts an evolution of the jet powers as a power law of linear size. this leads to a transition between models iia and iib in the very dense regime, where the jet energies are much higher than the magnetic energies of the surrounding medium. during this first epoch, we can calculate the age of a source within the first kpc assuming a constant jet power and a uniform density gradient. our study shows that sources evolve very close to self - similarity with the surrounding environment and having ages of @xmath00.3 to 5.0 years. the relevant physical parameters of the jets and the hot - spots are determined with very basic assumptions like synchrotron emission and minimum energy conditions. based on these parameters, a simple evolutionary scenario for these sources is proposed, in which the main features are that ( i ) the sources are located in very dense environments, so their physical parameters are closely constrained, and ( ii ) the advance speed of the sources is very small, because the colliding external medium is very dense. the model agrees with the fits of observational data for a sample of csos. we also conclude that csos are equivalent to frii, in the sense that a large fraction of them can be fit by a simple ram pressure equilibrium model.

we consider a mixed scenario where fluctuations from the inflaton and modulated reheating are responsible for cosmic density fluctuations today. in this scenario, we obtain the expressions for the scalar spectral index, tensor - to - scalar ratio and three non - linearity parameters such as the @xmath0-folding number, the spectral index in the hilbert space and the tensor amplitude. it is shown that all the inflationary parameters which are disfavored by the data can be liberated by adding the curvaton contribution. then, we study the effects of the contribution of the modulated coupling on non - renormalizable parameters of inflation, paying particular attention to in what cases non - gaussianity can be very large. for inflation models which are considered to have already been excluded by the wmap 5-year data, we also give discussions on what cases the contribution from modulation can liberate the model. after inflation, i.e. for models with inflaton oscillations around the minimum of its potential, we find that while the non - linearlyity between the modulus and inflaton gives a positive contribution to the cosmological scale, it generates a negative contribution in the presence of the curvature perturbations. moreover, the mixed model also gives a small energy of big - bang nucleosynthesis at some point of the phase transition from inflationary to radiation - dominated universe. we also study the inflation scenario where the energy density of the universe becomes negative before the time when the energy of neutrino oscillations crosses the hubble horizon. finally, we conjecture what the future will be like for the galaxy and for the primordial fluctuations. epsf # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) = cmr10 = cmbx10 scaled 1 = cmti10 scaled1 = cmmbx9 scaled1 # 1@xmath11 # 1 # 1[#1 ] # 1 [ firstpage ] cosmology : theory methods : numerical intergalactic medium large - scale structure of universe. ii. voids # 1 ( # 1 ). ii.1. formation of the cosmic microwave background. iii.2. the cosmic background. # 1section [ sec:#1 ] c|ccuss+u+u|q+u.1 + 1.5 cm [ cols="^ ", ]
we test the accuracy and limits of classical nucleation theory by comparing the nucleation rate calculated using molecular dynamics simulations to a rate found directly from spontaneously crystallizing simulations. at very high temperatures, the critical nuclei of crystalline silica crystallizes to stishovite, and the resulting distribution of clusters is found to be strongly deviant from that predicted by cnt. at the lowest @xmath0 g/@xmath1, the liquid exhibits the two - step relaxation in its dynamical properties characteristic of a deeply supercooled fluid, but it is still diffusive enough to reach metastable equilibrium on a time scale much shorter than the time scale for crystal nucleation. we study liquid silica as modelled by the barden - kirkpatrick potential, allowing us to calculate the free energy barrier to nucleation over a wide range of density, starting from an ensemble of independent simulations. in the metastable liquid, we find that the critical nucleus nuclei nucleate at a rate strongly deviates from the prediction of cnt, and that the kinetic prefactor required to explain the observed behavior of the nucleated nuclei is significantly larger than that calculated using cnt at higher temperature, raising the question of whether the theory is able to simultaneously account for the large, often overlooked rate of nucleation at this very high degree of supercooling. in order to determine the correct rate, we use a series of independent md simulations to track si and o atoms in a three - dimensional crystal disordered liquid. when the surface tension of the liquid drops through the critical potential, the si atoms follow a cluster - size distribution which, for a given cluster size, is roughly spherically symmetric. the shape of the clusters within the cluster is determined from the simulation time series, with a certain number of parameters. the clusters occupying regions of the cluster minimum are found numerically to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. at higher temperatures, however, the clusters lie close to, or at least within, the region of the phase diagram that is demarcated by the single - phase liquid, and this zone is poorly sampled in md simulations.
hensel lifting techniques are the basis of several polynomial factoring algorithms that are fast in practice. the standard approach to hensel lifting exploits the concept of preprocessing input polynomials that are sparse in the newton polygon, and then forces all of them to converge to a common, deterministic state. however, this method suffers from the drawback that it does not fully exploit the best merging structures available. in order to improve on this, we investigate the use of a caching - friendly mechanism, called funnel heap, for performing sums of products, and beyond, including batched chaining. funnel heap is a well known technique for chaining replicas outside the priority queue following insertions, and we show how it can be tailored to exploit it in a highly efficient manner. this leads to a chain of work that is asymptotically orders of magnitude faster in time, space, and cache complexity than the serialised version using a global funnel heap. this is achieved despite the fact that funnel heap requires a slightly more work overall. we conduct a detailed empirical study confirming the performance gains of funnel heap over the generic binary heap. specifically, we show that the cache - oblivious @xmath0-merger fails to achieve its optimal cache complexity when using funnel heap ; while the parallelised version does, in fact, achieve an order of magnitude improvement in cache complexity, funnel heap produces orders of magnitudes of speed reduction in work, space and cache reduction even when the latter is employed with the best possible merging structures. we further demonstrate that the sparsity of the input is the key to funnel heap s effectiveness, and that its performance in all three metrics is critically affected by the degree of input sparsity and by the number of distinct monomials residing in its inner workings. beyond its cache oblivious nature, funnel - hl is known to exhibit chaining that leads to an excellent traversal performance. we prove this again with batched - chain - based approach, and extend it to provide complete proofs of several other recent experimental results. this manuscript is the first part of a series that will see off the need for further research in this area. see the full paper at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2015.10.00668.
in this work, we study the influence of two different local treatments of convection on the calculation of the rates p at which solar radial modes are excited by turbulent convection. global models are built with the @xmath0 law of the model atmosphere using the mlt or cgm atmospheres. in the transition region where the mixing - length parameter is adjusted so as to reproduce the best agreement between synthetic and observed balmer line profiles, the atmosphere is gray and assumes eddington s approximation. the kurucz s model atmospheres are similar to the modified mlt atmosphere. we apply the same formulation to the atmosphere of the kcgm models ( the same parameters are used in both models ) and compare the computed rates p for each model with the solar data. the models are found to reproduce at best the solar radius at solar age and not the balmer lines. excitation rates p must be computed in the wavenumbers inner and outer of the atmosphere. for the inner region, the contributions of the convective eigenfunctions, the turbulent advection of entropy fluctuations and the solar radial oscillations contribute to the driving of the excitation modes. the frequency component of the adiabatic oscillations contributes the largest. we find that for the kmlt model and the cgm model, excitation propagates more slowly inside the atmosphere due to the different structure of very outer layers. on the contrary, for the emlt model, on the reverse effect occurs. the maximum excitation frequency of the radial modes is computed as a function of the solar optical depth. * *??? * for two models describing convection in the interior of a solar atmosphere * * * s. jadach@xmath1, * * b.f.l. mcclelland@xfig.1 * * 2.cm * * i.v. konoplevsky and v. shlyapvoda * * 1 cm * _ instituto de fsica corpuscular c.s.i.c./universitat de valncia + astrofsica aeroespacial + california institute of technology + madrid, spain _ + e - mail : k@femc.ific.uv.es _ + _ cern, ph department, theory division, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + *
we use the theory of low - redshift lyman - break quasars ( ltq ) to predict the fir - radio correlation ( frc ) for redshifts @xmath0. we find that the linearity and normalization of the frc provide strong constraints on the magnetic energy density in galaxies, which determines the strength of synchrotron losses. in high-@xmath1 starbursts, radio emission is expected to be strongly enhanced relative to the fir background because cosmic rays ( crs ) accelerate supernova remnants of massive stars. radio emission increases with the gas surface density and star formation rate in the galaxies. we directly calculate the predicted flux density from star - formation at 1.4 ghz and use it to compare the predictions with the observed cosmic infrared background ( cib ) and radio flux density at 10 ghz from radio - loud agns. our model predicts a radio excess with respect to the local frc that is a natural consequence of the different structure of star - forming galaxies at high redshift. we show that this radio excess is _ intrinsically _ different from that caused by their redshift and that it is thus unlikely to be simply due to cosmic ray losses alone. we propose a natural explanation of the radio excess based on the fact that radio emission traces ever lower electron energies in galaxies at higher magnetic field strength. the relative radio brightness of radio - bright submillimeter galaxies and other puffy starburst galaxies, as suggested by the recently - detected fir emission, is largely determined by their higher radio luminosity. we predict a radio - dimmer radio spectrum, with the predicted fraction of non - thermal radio emission ( or a ` ` radio dimmer '' radio spectrum ) due to inverse compton losses from cosmic rays. this dimming is found to be _ always _ higher in puffy than in compact galaxies. based on our model, we predict that ulirgs and other low - luminosity galaxies ( lirgs ) should have flat radio spectra ( with an approximate frequency distribution and a power - law spectral slope ), while massive sgrs should have flatter spectra with a steeper slope. this is in agreement with recent observations.
the ` ` three - body '' problem is as old as the study of physics itself. research has continued along a fragile path and to forte for approximation and/or distortion effects. two well established interpretations have emerged : ( i ) introduce a _ local momentum _, which depends upon the radial separation of two of the three particles through the logarithmic gradient of the continuum two - body wavefunction, and attribute the local distortion to dynamical screening of charges. ( ii ) reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of an effective charge potential, from which the generalized local momentum is deduced. a rigorous analysis of the mathematical and physical properties of the local momenta is carried out, and a solution for the problem is derived. it is shown that while local distortion effects generally fall - off in the asymptotic regions, they may alter the outcome of a scattering event by rearranging particles in the reaction - zone. the solution depends critically upon the form of the 3- body coulomb potential in the region, @xmath0, where two particles,@xmath1, are close together while a particle @xcite far away from both of them is infinitely far from any of them. this description is consistent with the observed asymmetry in the electron - positron triple - coincidence detection experiment. the experiment considered three large, very nearly equal mass, mutually interacting particles. with the appropriate total center - of - mass energy and reduced mass parameters chosen to reflect those used in the actual experiment, the predicted local effects are shown to be large enough to reproduce the asymmetry. this hypothesis is formalized and a semi - classical analysis reveals that while a real - valued, position dependent phase is added to the two- body continuum state wfunction, the remaining term in the expansion of that wavefunction remains unchanged. * keywords * : continuum atomic scattering, three body interaction, kinematic coupling, exact solution.
the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) is the largest and most well defined cosmological survey undertaken to date. it includes 596 unidentified galaxy clusters out of which 449 have a measured redshift. a complementary redshift survey for the northern celestial hemisphere ( reflex ) is also conducted within the rass. as a basic requirement for the reflex sample we use the x - ray observation ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) from the eso vlt. this allows us to search for galaxy clusters in the flux limited sample for a flux limit of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 @xmb2. since these clusters are expected to be over 90 % of the total sample there is sufficient sample size to study their properties and to determine their redshifts. in this paper we describe the construction of the reflex cluster sample and the optical follow - up observations that are necessary for the completeness of the cluster selection. we discuss the general characteristics of the agreement between the reflex and rass optical surveys and we show that the reflex optical data are of sufficient quality to allow a self - consistent analysis of the source properties with the help of an erg sharpness parameter and a fit of a lorentz function to the observed source counts. this technique is easily adapted for any other observing technique. we apply the method to the sample of 452 clusters and report a success of. we extend the survey into a region close to the galactic plane ( about 2/3 of the sky ) and obtain a missing fraction of clusters of about 2 - 3 % which can be recovered in the inner parts of the galactic disk and the dense stellar fields. we find that this region is too crowded to detect these clusters over the whole sky. the result is in good agreement with theoretical models of the formation and evolution of the universe which require a density of clusters to accurately reproduce the observed enrichment patterns. clusters : general cosmology : observations x - rays : galaxies : clusters
in this paper we present a deep optical photometric study of the hii region ic 2944/2948, located at @xmath0 kpc distance from the stellar cluster collinder 249, using information from the literature. our technique was complemented with archival data including radio, infrared, optical, and xmm - newton spectroscopy, in order to derive the fundamental parameters of the various stellar groups that surround this region. we could assess that there are several populations along this particular line of sight : a ) seven stars closest at about 700 pc, b ) six stars at 1.7 kpc, and c ) four stars at 3 - 4 kpc. we found that the closest stars are pms stars, and are as young as 2 - 3 myrs. we derived their imfs and we found their slope for massive stars is low but still compatible with the standard salpeter law. on the other hand, o - type stars in the area share similar kinematics and their representative values are different from that expected from galactic rotation models in this part of the milky way. regarding the mentioned young background population, we found it could have an apparent different kinematical structure, and it could possibly be responsible for exciting the nebula. out of the estimated stellar concentrations we could estimate the main populations of the three groups, two of them containing young stellar objects, one of them possibly belonging to the cluster collider 249. and the other two containing an old population that is believed to have been active for several myr. we compared the positions of all these groups and found them to be consistent with each other. finally, we compared their properties with those of young galactic clusters studied in the literature, and found that their properties are in good agreement with our estimates. this study helps us to better understand key astrophysical processes like star formation in the galactic disk and hii regions.
we present a 2-step protocol that exploits the feature selection of lower - dimensional transformation. we can transform high dimensional document vectors to low dimensional feature vectors, and in general it selects tens to hundreds of dimensions from thousands to tens of thousands. we call it feature selection _ fs _ in short. typical fs includes random matrix method ( rp ), random factorization ( df ), low dimensional transformation ( lf ), and feature selection ( pat ). we formally prove that fs can filter out many high dimensional vectors if they are non - similar, and we propose four different techniques as the discriminative implementation of fs. we first present a secure protocol, called ssdd - fs, that consists of three components : ( 1 ) the first step, namely rp ( remote processing ), df ( local frequency ), ( 2 ) presents a protocol that applies the secure protocol to @xmath0 dimensions, and ( 3 ) securitizes the document sets of alice and bob using their current vectors ( called alice - bob ) rather than disclosing them to another party. next, ssdd searches for similar document pairs whose cosine similarity is higher than a given tolerance, and it selects all such pairs by using the secure scalar product. the security of the proposed protocols is proven by showing that they are globally secure and show an increase in the performance by three or four orders of magnitude compared to the existing secure protocols. in the last step, we evaluate the performance of the secure fs and show that it provides the best performance compared with secure fs. document detection, feature selection, security, document encryption, similarity verification, similar document detection using two - step. + jiang et al. [ cols="^,<",options="header ", ] in this paper, we present four novel feature selections, called rp, df, lf, gf, and pat, which are all candidate feature selections for ssdd. their solutions are categorized into four categories : data perturbation, anonymization, distributed privacy preservation, and privacy preservation. ssdd can be considered as an application of distributed privacy privation.
we study the properties of poststarburst ( k+a or e+a ) galaxies using three - dimensional radiative transfer models. our models arise from a large suite of galaxy - galaxy mergers simulated with the radiative - transfer code sunrise. we find that the characteristic rapid inflow and consumption of gas during a major gas - rich merger is likely to be the cause of the observed high fraction of k+as in the field, but that the contribution to this population of galaxies may be split roughly equally. more generally, we study the evolution of gas fractions, aperture bias, and supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretion onto merger remnants, and find that realistically - simulated major merger remnants commonly satisfy the traditional line selection cuts, but there is significant deviation, in terms of both merger orbit and progenitor properties, due to differences in the expected lifetime of this phase. we show that for equal - mass mergers and for gas fractions that fall of roughly linear with @xmath0, physical mergers produce significantly shorter, or even no k+ a phase, than non - merger mergers. this deviation is particularly pronounced for gaseous, stellar - bulge - dominated galaxies. in non - merging cases, gas infall during the merger is typically short ( a few gyr ), and accompanied by a rapid starburst that re - forms the stellar disk. we provide analytic approximations to these trends that are plotted as the solid black curves in figure [ fig : parametersummaries ]. the differences between non - major and merger - induced k+ae are due to a combination of different dust attenuation, a bulge mass ratio, and agn feedback, the latter of which is controlled by the viewing angle of the merging inflow into the ism. we discuss the implications of these results for the role of mergers in driving galaxy evolution. we also demonstrate the ability of sunrise to systematically study galaxy spectra in a spatially resolved way. these tests illustrate that the magnitude and nature of the effect of dust in the diffuse ism depends in detail on the three -dimensional distribution of the gas and dust with respect to the a star population and star - forming regions.
in this paper we present a novel blind - deconvolution method for obtaining effective connectivity information in the context of blood - oxygenation - level - dependent ( bold)-functional magnetri ( fmri ) data : confounding effect of hemodynamic response function ( hrf ) and conditioning to a large number of variables in presence of short time series. the proposed approach uses granger causality ( pcgc ), a recently proposed biophysically informed approach. it is based on the _ cubature kalman filtering _, a property of the state - of - the - art state - space hubble filter [ 1 ]. the haemodynamics of large - scale complex networks can be modeled as a linear and time invariant system, i.e. with a hubble constant ( @xmath0 ). the parameters of the model are determined by the high - resolution electroencephalography ( eeg ), with and without explicit neural inputs. in this way, the structure and dynamics of the network can be reconstructed at the bold level by considering the network as a two - stage complex network, with activation and non - activation states embedded in different regions of the brain. the decoupling of high - level and low - level signals is achieved via a fast time transformation from neural activation to bold response. this transformation does not rely on any specific information on timing or a priori spatial information of events. however, it does depend on the fact that the time series could be the average of time series over a region of interest with any scale, or series extracted by independent or principal component analysis. a direct comparison between the results of the proposed method and previous studies on evaluating the usefulness of hrf for different task - related mri studies shows that the bold signal is still the most useful candidate for this purpose, despite the different theoretical approaches proposed so far. the presented approach could be a useful tool for the detailed characterization of the human brain network and for the understanding of the mechanisms which govern its topological properties. = 1
the highly - collimated molecular outflow from l1448c(n ), which is known to drive the extremely - high velocity ( ehv ) and jetlike narrow region of the molecular flow, was mapped with the submillimeter array ( sma ) at @xmath0=87, co ( j=32 ), and 350 ghz emission lines. it is shown that the compact component is elongated perpendicular to the outflow axis, which may be a circumstellar disk with a size of up to 250 au. the ratio of the velocity gradient to the radial velocity gradient indicates that the outermost part of the disk is more highly collimated than the innermost part. the observed deflection, wiggling, and velocity variation of the jet suggest the possibility that l14c( n ) is a close binary system, with an orbital radius of 2.44.2 au and a separation of 60 au. on the other hand, the separation of the central source is smaller than 40 au, implying a larger mass - loss rate due to the misalignment between the driving source and the line - of - sight. the sio observations by h. j. lezec, n. k. ong, and b1 on the azimuthal anti - center radio jet detected near the source reveal that the jet is extremely active, with two distinct components running along the axes of the lobes and a jet - like component extending up to 70 km s@xmath5. the quiescent jet has an orbital period of 412.03 yr and shows significant velocity variations at a time when it is 0.030.09 yr. the mechanical luminosity of the compact jet is 3.5 times larger than the bolometric luminosityof the central star, 8.6 times greater than the eddington luminosity. the masses of the circumstellar material and the observed jet+shell structure can be explained by the ` ` unified model '' proposed by bose et al. the compact nuclear outflow shell is estimated to consist of ambient material swept up by the radial wind from a young star. the mass outflow rate in the region enclosed by the jet and shell is much lower than that in the extended outflow region, suggesting that the former is triggered by the latter s version of the unified model.

we examine the effect of metals on the evolution of gas in protogalactic halos formed from cold, metal - enriched gas in a top - hat dark matter potential. we use particle - splitter simulations to follow the collapse of gas with metallicities as low as @xmath0. this set of initial conditions is an improvement over previous simulations that neglected molecular cooling, which assumed that fine structure cooling would dominate the cooling over many orders of magnitude in density. we find that cooling from atomic fine structure is sufficient to allow the gas to cool and fragment, but the gas cools very rapidly and fragments only if the metallicity is high enough to render the cooling time shorter the local dynamical timescale. with our arguably more realistic initial conditions, and improved cooling results, we find no threshold above which the gas can not cool beyond the resolution of the simulations. in the simulations presented here, we employ the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget, a lagrangian method described in previous studies of the formation of population ii stars. we first follow the thermal, chemical, and dynamical evolution of cold gas for several million years in order to gauge the extent to which metals affect the collapse. heating by the metal enrichment of the gas plays a key role in keeping the gas hot and prevents it from cooling very rapidly, even in the complete absence of molecular cooling. in low density gas, even without additional cooling, the metal abundance is found to be linked to fragmentation. we conclude that the transition from the primordial to the modern imf therefore depends on the conditions under which stars form as much as on the metal abundances present. we present the results of simulations with both zero and metallicities. our results show that the presence of metals at all metallicities substantially reduces the probability that gas fragments and cools rapidly, making it more likely to form population iii stars.

by using the homogenized effective material properties of doubly periodic photonic and phononic crystals, we show that negative refraction with positive phase - velocity refraction can be realized over a wide frequency range of the first ( lowest ) frequency pass band for the first time in these crystals. we develop a unified method to accurately and efficiently produce the homogeneized constitutive parameters of such crystals. to this end, we first consider the basic field equations over a unit cell composed of a typical unit cell and demonstrate the one - to - one correspondence between the type of wave vector and the total number of constituents of a given unit cell. then we present a general method to systematically average the periodic part of the field variables over each unit cell in such a manner that both continuity and periodicity are preserved. by working out illustrative examples for the two - dimensional and three - dimensional cases, we reveal a rich body of refractive characteristics, that has thus far been hidden, that can be realizing in photonic or phononic crystal with even the simplest unit cells. we find that the most interesting and unique feature of these crystals is the refractive response of their unit cells, which fully embody the original heterogeneous periodic composite. we then show how these unit cells can be controlled and modified so that they may behave as a so - called metamaterials, i.e. as follows : ( a ) by designing a rectangular lattice structure with a square or anisotropic anisotropy, one can readily identify the direction of the energy flow in a photonic crystal, ( b ) by controlling the relative to the group velocity vectors and the phase velocity vectors in terms of the wave - vector and frequency and wave vector ; ( c ) by using an isotropic dielectric matrix. in addition to this, one - dimensional method, we also consider a very simple unit cell consisting of a central hole and a square lattice for a negative - velocity sh wave. we believe these results and the proposed method of analysis are new and should provide powerful tools for designing novel photonic ( photonic / phononic ) crystals.
we present new data on highly polarized pulsars at 4.9 ghz. these data are sensitive to the pulsar spin period and to the properties of the surrounding medium. we find seven known associations with supernova remnants and a couple of snr - candidates. agreement in age is of great importance, since the age of the pulsars should not much exceed @xmath0 years. the characteristic age could therefore be overestimated by more than an order of magnitude. using the data, we discuss the characteristics of young pulsars and, where possible, theoretical relations are found. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 = cmr10 scaled1 = cmbx10 scaled 1 # 1@xmath1 # 1#2 avec pulsar b1915 + 13, submitted to _ phys. rev. _ c _ epsf.sty _ the results of pulsar polarization measurements with the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope show that b0833 - 45 is highly polarized and that there is a systematic decrease of the mean polarization with time. the degree of polarization is measured to be 30 %, which is higher than the polarization of 20 % found for other pulsars. we discuss a number of phenomena which could be connected with the high polarization. e.g., highly polarized sources are associated with snrs ( reich et al. 1992, kassim & weiler 1990 ). this is the case for the vela pulsar as well as for the crab pulsar. for the last two years, there is no clear evidence for a pulsar - snr association. if it is confirmed, the association would be very significant since it would imply that all these pulsars are part of the supernova remnant population. cep 377 - 43, ipmu 17 - 44, fermilab 11 - 62, and hep - ph/085004 * keywords : * pulsars ; supernovae remnants
the density distributions of visible and dark matter components in the andromeda galaxy, m31, are derived from a compilation of photometrical and kinematical data. stellar metallicities are estimated from independent spectral observations and colour - magnitude diagrams. we use these data as input parameters for chemical evolution models of galactic components, calculating the ages, masses and @xmath0 of the visible galactic components. in principle, the derived data can be used to calculate the luminosity and mass of a stellar population. we apply the results of the present paper to a mass distribution model of m31. the model is constructed on the basis of phase - space distribution function of stellar populations in axially symmetric systems. it includes formation time, star formation rate, initial metallicity and the effects of dust. in addition to this, the model includes a history of chemical evolution, a bar population and the elongated nucleus of the galaxy. to obtain an agreement with the measured rotation and dispersion distributions, we have also considered the case of a kinematically active galactic nucleus responsible for the absorption of the stellar signals. the models show that the presence of such a nucleus can not be ruled out in the present study. in the companion paper, paper ii ( *??? * ), we derive the density distribution parameters of visible stellar components and evaluate their cosmological significance. the derived parameters are compatible with the observed rotation velocities and velocity dispersions of the stars in the bulge and the disc regions. we find that the abundance of dark matter must be included in the final models, as it has been found from the observations. finally, the _ l _ and _ u _ colours of the galactic components fit the data better than the cuspy profiles of stellar haloes, but other colours are needed to obtain a better agreement.

the spin - down of pulsars is the result of a superposition of various mechanisms. in the present study, we track the @xmath0 evolution of the three best known pulsars : the vela pulsar, the crab pulsar and the young radio pulsar psr j1734@xmath163333. we have performed coherent timing measurements with the jodrell bank and parkes telescopes of these pulsars and measured the secular evolution of their braking indices using the markov chain monte carlo method. we report rather low values of the braking indices of all three pulsars. the results are compared with previous measurements and some preliminary results of the pulsar spectral energy distribution and stellar population synthesis models. the improved statistics, combined with the large number of measurements, will allow us to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the different behaviour of young pulsars, and understand how they evolve in time. pulsars are an important element of the galaxy s pulsar population and have a huge amount of information regarding the internal mechanisms that govern its spin down. the basic parameters of these mechanisms are, of course, the magnetic field and the dipole component of its magnetic dipole, and the characteristics of the resulting dipole - dipole interaction, such as dipole angular momentum and dipole magnetic field, the nature of the spin and timing noise and the effects of pulsar noise. in this paper, we report on our latest results and speculate on how we might expect these parameters to change with time and how this evolution might be observable. address = blackett laboratory, imperial college of science, technology and medicine, prince consort road, london sw7 2az, uk address = school of physics and astronomy, university of manchester, + manchester m13 9pl, england address = centre de recherche astrophysique de vela, cnrs, universit paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex, france address = department of physics, kavli institute for astro and particle physics, + massachusetts institute of technology, cambridge, ma 02138, usa address = max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik, giessenbachstrasse 1, 85748 garching, germany address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via emilio bianchi 46, i23807 merate ( lc ), it
we have used the new data presented here to improve the v band light curves of some cepheids in ngc 300, and to derive the period - luminosity relations of these variables in the v, i band. these relations have been constructed using the algorithms described in pietrzyski et al. ( 2002 ), and in our group. they were then used to determine the cepheid distance to this galaxy. a total random error of 0.04 mag was found in our determination of the distance, together with a possible zero point shift over the ccd. the systematic uncertainty of this distance result is @xmath0 0.05 mag, which is considerably less than the uncertainty of the lmc distance modulus derived from a similar dataset with a much larger random error, and almost twice the value of the random error in our adopted photometric zero point. thus, our distance is not significantly affected by the problem of unresolved nearby stars. the new v - band observations started on 2002 october 5 and lasted until 2003 november 11, providing a time baseline of nearly 4.5 years for these very modern data. we have discovered a new red clump giant and another possible blue supergiant, and no other red clumps or galaxies are known to us. the red giant branch of the i - band light curve does not appear to be consistent with the mekal luminosity of the galaxy, indicating that either we have lost 18 percent of the light which we were carrying out with this tool, or that we have underestimated the metallicity by a factor of at least 2. taking all these factors into account, we find a distance to ngc300 of ( 26.43 @xik00.04)@xmath1 0.13 ( systematic ) mag, combining other distance indicators obtained with the eso wide field imager. this result agrees very well with the results obtained with freedman et al.. on average, there is no evidence of any offset between the different datasets, and there is a very good agreement between the first and the second datasets also when the zero point is considered to be varying over the respective fields of the cameras we used. the position of the zero - point offset is found to be nearly constant between all datasets. our distance determination is essentially independent of the adopted zero point offset : it is simply a consequence of using the same total number of variables which would have been preferred if they were to be considered individually, and thus does not introduce any significant effect from met
we present a photometric analysis of the central region of the antlia cluster of galaxies, based on images obtained with the cerro tololo inter american observatory mosaic camera. the data set comprises 375 galaxies, of which 375 are spectroscopically confirmed antlia members and 375 are considered to be members of their antlia group catalogue. among these objects, four are late - type ce galaxies. the other two are close in projection to either one of the dominant galaxies of the cluster, and are separated from the locus of the early - type members in the luminosity - mean effective surface brightness diagram. they display some characteristics of ce galaxies, but they do not constitute a homogeneous class. the main difference between these two classes of objects is their high central surface brightness. the brightness profile of fs90110 is not a simple srsic law, but an amalgam of several general brightness profiles. it can not be fitted with a single one, as it is done for the other confirmed members. two of the brighter galaxies in the sample, fs90165 and fs90192, display a disky appearance, which could be caused by a giant distortion of the axisymmetric components of their stellar populations. the projected location of the objects is close to the centre of the cd galaxy ngc4486b in the virgo cluster, at a distance of @xmath0 kpc, and near the giant elliptical ngc5846a in the cluster abell 496. in addition to this, the objects also display a distorted appearance, with a distorted limb and a large compared to the others. they are compact with a shape similar to the elliptical galaxies in virgo and fornax. the objects are, however, broader in shape and morphological type than virgo early - types. we discuss these results in the context of their origin and in relation to the cluster dynamics.

we present the analysis of _ chandra _ data on the galaxy cluster rx j1720.1 + 2638. this cluster has recently been shown to possess a surface brightness edge on its northern side, which can not be produced by a shock front. we argue that the observed edges are consistent with the collapse of two different density perturbations in the primordial density field, onto nearly the same location in space, respectively. if we assume that most of the gravitational mass inside @xmath0 kpc belongs to the merger subclump, then we can estimate that the ratio between the masses of the merging objects was between 3 to 5. we show that, even though the inferred mass deposition rate obtained from the x - ray data is significantly lower than that obtained from, we can not exclude that this cluster hosts a massive ( or moderate ) cooling flow. in fact, we find that the temperature across the edge is higher than in the shock front, of which the temperature in front of the shock is below the ` ` post shock '' temperature for the region at the location of the edge. for this reason these edges are indeed the result of a new unpredicted phenomenon. we discuss the implication of the presence of a cold front in a massive cooling flow cluster. as has been suggested before with other clusters of galaxies, if the cluster is in the last stage of merging before it becomes fully relaxed, then it may be important to monitor the fluctuations in the cluster potential in order to determine the timescale of further merging. more generally, we need to be very careful in the evaluation of the mass estimates of clusters. our analysis suggests that the cooling flow mass could have been underestimated by a factor of 2 or more in the past. if this is the case, the cluster might have formed a few hundred years ago, but the mass accretion rate has been low, if it is not in the final stages of merging.
the discovery of several gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with durations of @xmath0 s permits follow - on optical observations that can now be performed routinely. the fraction of grbs that are associated with directionally coincident with optical transient counterparts or with optical transients within the field of grb x - ray afterglows has recently been estimated and is in agreement with previous studies. astrophysical scenarios based on the hypothesis that grbs are the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed grbs. the number and energy of extracted cosmic rays, produced in grb blast waves, is expected to be a small fraction of the total hadronic cosmic ray output of the universe. we investigate the possibility that grb sources can accelerate the highest energy protons and neutrons to observed energies through relativistic shock acceleration. we develop an external shock model for grbs and calculate the neutron and neutrino production spectra from radiation in the blast wave. the observed luminosity of star - forming regions in the universe is shown to be consistent with the predictions of a scenario in which the longest grb - period supernovae ( sne ) take the form of comoving neutron - decay halos. the cosmic ray rate density and energy release rate per unit comoving volume are derived, and the well - known tight upper limit to the rate of direct and indirect synchrotron radiation from sne is used to constrain the size and spectral characteristics of the extragalactic nuclei. it is found that in the large - scale stellar fields of galaxies with active star formation and nuclear activity will produce non - thermal comptonizing cosmic rays with energies at or near their eddington luminosities. most of the produced neutrinos will be bound to the central regions of their host galaxies, except for a very small fraction in the milky way. galaxies with intense star formation will, therefore, have regions of unusually high cosmic ray production rate and luminosity that will likely be detectable in the near future. gamma - rays : bursts - radiation mechanisms : nonthermal - cosmic rays : theory - shock waves
we examine a class of models for @xmath0 coupled, spatially separated quantum oscillators interacting with a common scalar quantum field bath at finite temperature, where the existence of exact solutions can provide unambiguous quantification of physical variables, thermodynamic relations and help to clarify basic issues in quantum thermodynamics ( qtd ). the model set - up contemplates three main components : the physical properties of the system, the coupling between the system and the shared bath and the way they interact. we first examine the nature of internal energy, heat capacity and the third law of thermodynamics for a fully nonequilibrium ( neq ) open system evolving to an equilibrium state. the conditions for traditional td theory to be well - defined and operative for a classical or quantum system are very specific despite its wide range applicability : a system of relatively fewer degrees of freedom in the presence of a thermal bath of a huge number or infinite degrees of free time, or in the case of a canonical ensemble of ensembles, it is simply shown that the extensive property of the internal energy in the final equilibrium state is the same as that of coupled oscillators in conventional thermodynamics, that is, in the vanishingly small coupling limit the system is eternally in a thermal equilibrium state by proxy with the bath which is impervious to any change in the system. these properties are independent of the spatial arrangement of the oscillators, the inter - oscillator coupling and the system - bath interaction strength. thus it is clear that the behavior of the open system is a many - to - one relation and many different initial conditions can produce the same final steady / equilibrium state irrespective of the bath arrangement. by contrast the behaviors of the thermodynamics of strongly interacting quantum systems - especially in a zero temperature regime - are very different from the ones we are familiar with from the perspective of open quantum systems. as an example we examine the heat capacity of the coupled harmonic oscillator system at low and zero temperatures and find a power law behavior. we demonstrate with numerical simulations that if the system initially is prepared in a state that is not in thermal equilibrium with the common bath, then the reduced system will equilibrate at late times and its behavior toward zero temperature. we also show that even weakly coupled strongly interacting systems can have an asymptotic extensivity of heat capacity as long as the zero temperature behavior is above the minimum temperature that can be regarded as a requirement for entanglement. the extensive heat capacity near absolute zero is shown to be proportional to the
we study the dynamical evolution of an @xmath0 strongly out of equilibrium initial quantum field theory, prepared in a high temperature, high density qcd plasma that undergoes high energy, heavy ion - ion collisions. the initial state is characterized by a particle distribution localized in a thin spherical shell, a ` ` tsunami '' and the onset of bose condensation of pions. we study the dynamics in the leading order ( hard ) approximation in the momentum correlation volume for a large number of particles per correlation volume. the dynamics can not be described in terms of hydrodynamic evolution. since the processes under consideration are collisionless, there is no local thermodynamic equilibrium and an equation of state is ill - defined. we model the dynamics using wave - functionals of the system in the schwinger - keldysh representation which allows us to track the evolution in the non - equilibrium, perturbative aspects of the particle production and hadronization. in this description we identify the phase transition and the formation of chiral condensates ( dcc s ) despite the simplification of the dynamics with respect to a spherical shell. the evolution is studied with boost - invariant relativistic hydrodynamics. we present analytical estimates for the parameters of the wave functional, discuss the implications of the results for the matter flow on the dcc scenario and propose a measurement of the ` ` pion wall '' effect. + pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm numerical studies of dynamics during the early stages of the electron - positron collisions in heavy ion collisions s.m. kobakhidze@xmath1, m. kozhuharov@xfig.gov, + v. andreev@v2.in ` ` pancakes collide to form pions in the hot quark - gluon plasma '', + _ at. mol. opt. phys. _, * 127 *, 23112314 ( 2005 ), + * 99 * * a.v. shor, a.d. missevitch, and n. tretyak, ` ` the dynamics of an ` ` atoll dipole '' in high temperature and high density plasmas, '' phys. rev. lett. * 98 *, 075005 ( 2009 ). r. remillard, p. skubic, and w. tittel _ ` ` jets and outflows in high energy heavy ion physics ''
the gluon propagator is studied on the lattice by looking at the euclidean two - point correlation functions. a procedure for deriving its effective energy is proposed, using the techniques of monte carlo generation, which allows for an independent determination of the parameters of the theory. it is found that the effective energy violates the spectral decomposition condition, and that, for high momenta, the value of the dimensionful parameter @xmath0 is found to be a non - monotonic function of the momentum. the region of free volume contains many points, which can be used to check the stability of the fits, and the infrared cut - off. some of these points are so isolated that their existence can not be investigated by the usual methods. anticipating some of the results, we have suggested a method to detect the presence of infrared and ultraviolet effects. this method has proven to be useful in the study of the continuum limit, for it carries much more sensitivity to the details of the underlying lattice than the spectrum analysis. + pacs numbers : 11.15.hh, 11.25.jh, 12.38.bx = -0.3 cm = -1.5 cm = 23.cm = 24.2 cm = 25.6 cm = 16.7 cm = 5.0 cm @=11 caption#1[#2]#3 @=12.7ex @=8.5ex gev mev ev kev tev s_w c_w s^2_w q_eff m_z m_pl ^-2 ^-1 _ cp u#1^#2 # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( 19#2 ) # 3 # 1 # 2 # 3phys. lett. b * # 1 * [ # 2 ] # 3.#1#1_phys. rev. _ d#1 _ proc. cam. phil. soc. ed. _ # 1 _ # 2 ( # 3 : # 4 ) # 1 hep - ph/960131268 address= max - planck institut fr physik, knigstuhl 17, d-69117 heidelberg, germany address = jagiellonian university, ul. orla 171, 30 - 244, ljubljana, slovenia address = department of physics, tokyo gakugei university, koganei, to

we consider a situation of equilibrium between two states, i.e. india and pakistan. we assume that both states have enough nuclear deterrence to annihilate each other and the state capability it is similar ( not true in reality but the aim of this work is to study the influence of others factors on equilibrium ), the study of assymetric nuclear and economical situation will be adress to fututre works @xcite. + the hypothesis was made to fit a small number of macroscopic variables, which represent the temperature of the gas, number of moles, volume occupied by the gas and pressure made by the nuclear deterrence of the state. in this context one can say that escalation dominance could be a threat for equilibrium : if a state makes too much ( or too littll ) pressure it would be very hard to reach equilibrium with another state. an interesting fact is that also in this case a nuclear war can occur when the pressure from india is large enough. + to determine the pressure that a state is able to do, we use a state equation : a constitutive mathematical relation, that s gives the possibility to estimate one of the parameters if the others are known. let s suppose that the two states have a low interaction with other states, e.g. the attention of international establishment or of neighbour state is elsewhere, if this occurs it describes a dramatical situation, since not equilibrium can anymore occur. + if the temperature is high, then attention of external states can enlarge the worries of the states that compose the system, so this will cause a temperature increase. + using a thermodynamics toy model, we simulate the action of each state as a different temperature, that means that in this scenario the behaviour of one state is the same as that of the other states. + in geopolitical analogy it is a critical parameter, because a gas can be compressed until it reaches @xmath0 value, if the mentioned conditions hold true then the system will be divided into two parts and the abnormal state will be contained in the region where it is unstable. we show that the most important issue for reaching a geopolitical stability is the presence of non - state actors or internal instability of a state. the importance of nuclear powers in the area is not mainly cause of instability and it is not sufficient to be cause of a war. it is important to understand if factors due to instability or conventional military forces are fundamental to reach an equilibrium, usually this kind of factors are taken away using the unitary actors theory. + our results
this paper reports results of calculations of time dependent diffusion in evolving white dwarf models. since diffusion is only slightly broadened by diffusion in the outer layers of white dwarfs, we evolve models with equilibrium diffusion profiles in the interiors. the time scale to reach equilibrium increases dramatically with depth and with a shallow gradient. in realistic models, diffusion takes a long time to approach equilibrium in deeper layers, and equilibrium concentrations are reached from the outside inward. bradley & winget ( 1994 : ` ` bw '' ) studied the slow evolution of the pulsating prototype of the db pulsator pg 1159, using a different evolutionary code and input physics. they constructed evolutionary models that closely matched the observed properties of this star. in this paper, we compare the results of our models with the ones of bw for the closely related neutron star gd 358. our results suggest that diffusion is an important ingredient in white dwarf evolution, and that it might be important in some of the evolution of blue compact objects as well as red compact stars. * pulsation diagnostics : * a review * of the latest pulsation experiments and of models that have been used to constrain the compositional structure of red supergiants. * the james webb telescope ( jwst ) has revolutionized the study of pulsation properties of stars. by discovering pulsation spacings that have a ratio of one - year to one - thousand - year intervals, it has discovered a rich population of pulsating neutron stars. these neutron stars, whose pulsations can be described by a few universal pulsation modes, have enriched the stellar interior with elements from a wide variety of elements, including carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and helium. these stars have a unique spectrum, with over 200 separate pulsation frequencies. euve, rosat, & al. ( 1995a ) found that the surface composition of the star is roughly 33 % he, 50 % @xmath0, and 17 %@xmath1 by mass, ( werner et al. 1991 ) ; the composition transition is where the helium mass fraction drops to zero, but the surface layer remains pure helium. bw introduced a model that accurately reproduced the pulsation spectrum, capturing the essential features of this object. we show that our own evolutionary models are unable to match the observations of pg 358, because they deviate greatly from the original evolutionary model. in particular, our models seem to be very similar, even though each evolutionary model begins with a very different initial mass function and composition transition.
observations of the x - ray emission from oe / be stars have shown that the mg xi @xmath0 line emission arises in a region of gaseous substructures well upstream of the dense disk from which the ionized gas is heated. this region is well described by a model of a magnetically torqued disk ( mtdgd ). the model is based on the assumption that be stars are rotating at their traditional values of about 70 percent critical and these rotation rates are sufficient to explain the observed emission measures for the entire set of observational data within the context of the mtd picture. to this purpose, the model has been tested to see if it can explain the basic x / o star emission properties ( line widths, profiles, line shapes, and ) without adjusting other model parameters. the response of the model to the detailed structure of the stellar winds has not yet been determined, so we are using the observational data solely as evidence for the rotation rate and gravity darkening effects. in this paper we focus on the emission from the region of the disk where the emission measures are most sensitive to the stellar wind velocity and rotation rate. we compare model predictions to the emission measure derived from observations with the stellar parameters : the mass flux from the disk, the euv density of the wind around the star, the amount of disk material that is in the form of hot dust, the location of the hot wind, and the ratio of the radial to the azimuthal magnetic field strength. we find that the model can produce adequate fits to the observations of three main spectral types of b stars ( b2 v, b3 v, and b4 v ) for all values of these parameters ( critical, g0.1 - 0.4, weakly magnetically magnetized and moderately magnetized ). there are only two main results of this paper. ( a ) the model reasonably predicts emission well above the ionization level and consistent with observations, although the model does not require extremely large amounts of gas. ( b ) the derived model parameters are adequate for the production of x - rays from the stellar surfaces. furthermore, the inferred line width is within the range that is predicted, even for the lowest mass stars in the sample. this emphasizes the need for a model that includes self - gravity and that takes into account the effects of rotational gravity on the disk.
the origin of the light elements be and b, and their ratio, the libeb abundance versus mass number, drew a serious attention within the last 10 gyr. this issue was addressed in detail in the context of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis, in which it was demonstrated that these elements are produced by i ) fast ( p,@xmath0 ) co nuclei on cno in the ism at low energy ( primary ), ii ) fast co on h, he and/or o in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and iii ) slow co on sn ii. the genesis of beb was so obscure that they were referred to as x the process leading to its production. four parameters are influential to the spallative production of light elements : the reaction cross sections, the energy spectrum of fast nuclei, the composition of the beam, i.e., grain products and cosmic rays. the best known result is that the ratio of be / h to [ fe / h ] = -1 and that the b / be ratio lies in the range 10 - 30 ; this is another proof that nature follows the rules of nuclear physics. analyzing all the physical parameters discussed above, two main producers of libeb in the early galaxy emerge, the first one is the standard gcr ( spectrum 1 ) in which fast p,xmath3 nuclei produced and accelerated by massive stars ( wr and sn ii ) fragment on h and he as they fragment on the h - rich ism. this mechanism is related to superbubbles ( s ) through a scenario proposed bykov ( 1995 ), parizot ( 1998 ) and vangioni - flam ( 1998a ). the second mechanism is a more distant process related to sn ii, the reverse to the gcr in which sn ii decays via supernovae ( sb and sb, respectively ). this idea is supported by observations ( for a review see e.g. di vita, 2009 ). it is based on an extrapolation over the whole galactic evolution assuming that all the other ingredients are the same as before including cosmic rays and @xmath4 4. possible alternates between the two mechanisms are discussed. one of them, the supernova - driven wind of massive stars, makes the predictions of the superbubble hypothesis quite plausible although it is difficult to confirm through observations ( boesgaard 1998 ). # 1 # 1 1.25 in.125 in.25 in
we show that quasinormal ringing can be excited by relativistic particles falling into a black hole at an appropriate rate, and that the resulting gravitational waveform can be interpreted in terms of the waveform for the black hole. this is confirmed by detailed simulations of rotating gravitational collapse and head - on black hole collisions. our review emphasizes areas that remain to be studied, but which, in fact, are already covered in a number of different publications. for simplicity we consider the process of clumps of mass @xmath0 falling into black holes with sizes much smaller than the schwarzschild radius. recent numerical simulations based on the free - fall ( oppenheimer - snyder ) collapse model for the infalling clumps show that the total radiated energy is in general smaller than that radiated by a single particle, but larger than the energy losses found in recent calculations of rotating stellar core collapse to protoneutron stars. thus, the excitation of gravitational perturbations of kerr black holes by this process is limited. we discuss excitation in the context of other physical scenarios, such as gravitational collapse, evolutions of single distorted black holes, and colliding black hole systems. # 1_#1 _ = # 1 1.25 in.125 in.25 in for a considerable time there has been much progress in our understanding of the mechanisms by which gravitational waves are emitted from black holes. almost all the works on the subject focus on the physics of the source, rather than on the astrophysical processes involved in the emission itself. still, there is a lot of interest in the mechanism because of its connections to quantum mechanics, and in particular its possible applications to particle physics. for example, it is important to understand the how gravitational waves propagate in the first place, and to identify the physical processes responsible for the emission of gravitational waves in the universe. efforts to establish the fundamental parameters of gravitational wave propagation have been quite successful, and a great deal of progress has been made in recent years. this has been especially the case for the type of charged particles that dominate the gravitational wave signals from supernovae and gamma - ray bursts. in this review we show that quantum wave propagation in the perturbative regime can be indeed excited by clumpy, unmagnetized matter. we will first summarize the results in section [ sec : qw ], and then give a brief discussion of other results and open problems. from the analytically derived results it is possible to apply these results to different problems, such
in this paper we examine isolated black holes ( ibhs ) as possible jet sources. we propose the idea that bhs with spherical accretion i.e. without formation of an accretion disk can be sources of relativistic jets powered by rotating bhs ( blandford - znajek mechanism ) or, e.g., by accretion from massive binaries in close binary systems. we find that the non - thermal efficiency of these sources depends strongly on the density of the surrounding medium. specifically, if the density is high enough, in the case of high enough density, the ibh can act as a source of electron cr positrons via both synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) channels. on the other hand, in low density environments, ibh jets are expected to be powerful enough to launch non - thermally charged particles up to vhe. jet powers launched from ibh in high density environments are characterized by a larger power and a stronger magnetic field. the luminosities radiated via these two mechanisms should be similar, since the expected energies of the target photons are comparable. the dominant target photon field for the ic is expected to come from the local interstellar cloud, while that for the bh itself is dominated by the intracluster medium. if a significant fraction of the material can be accreted by an ibh jet, the bolometric luminosity of the source should be significantly higher than that of the local bubble. moreover, the ratio of the escape time to radiative cooling time, @xmath0, decreases with increase of the strength of the magnetic field and lowenergativity of the forward shock. in this case, for typical values of the mc density, typical of low radio to soft gamma - ray spectral energy distributions should be comparable to the standard bohm - diffusion regime. the frequency of ibh detection potential of future space missions should be directed towards these high density jet sources in order to better understand physical conditions within the host mc. black hole physics methods : numerical stars : neutron pulsars : general radiative transfer ism : jets and outflows x - rays : general.
we present an _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) _ observation of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc 4151. the observation was made in two phases. a preliminary 4.3 ks observation was taken on dec. 4 1999 in ` ` alternating mode '', in which single exposures with a 0.1 s frame time were alternated with two contrasting 0.4 s exposures. this allowed us to evaluate the effects of the ` ` pile up '' in the bright inner regions of the nucleus and extended regions. comparing the results from the two phases, we found that the nucleus is significantly piled up in both the 0.2 s and 0. 1 s observations. the resulting x - ray spectra are poorly resolved but show both warm and collisionally ionized emission in the extended region. a comparison with grating observations from the _ chandra _ hetgs shows the presence of both gas in photoionization and collisional ionization. in addition, there is a clear difference in the spectral properties between the two gas phases, with the hot gas ( @xmath0 k ) emitting in the broad line region and the cold gas in the narrow line region. we reanalysed some of the data with the latest version of ciao v2.1.2. the change in derived parameters, such as the photon index, bremsstrahlung temperature and emission line properties, agree well with the observations of ogle et al. ( 2000 ). we also obtained new ` ` compton '' resolution images of the extended 0.5 kev emission far from the nucleus. the extended emission comprises of bright, unresolved emission near the center of the galaxy and more faint, extended emission about 22 sw of the center. although we can not uniquely assign a timecale to the relative motion of the total emission in either phase, the short time scale of the soft emission suggests it is most likely to be thomson - scattered nuclear radiation. the 20 kev photon index of the 29 kev component is not resolved in our observations, but there is evidence for a spectral - flux correlation above 2 kev.
we present a general scheme to analyze the supercooled water phase diagram in terms of the interplay between the strengths of the directional contribution to the h bond interaction and its cooperative part. we identify a critical point in the phase diagram that terminates at a liquid - phase critical point. our analysis applies to a number of different models that have been proposed for the behavior of the pressure temperature @xmath0. a question that naturally arises is whether the macroscopic thermodynamic descriptions are in fact connected in some way. using the scheme presented here, we show that the steady state behavior of liquid water is can be understood as the sum of several contributions, the first of which is the london dispersion interaction. the second component is due to the repulsive interaction between the electron clouds. this component includes both the weak directional component as well as the strong isotropic interaction of the hydrogen bond. throughout this interaction, water s anomalies are the effect of the excitation of locally favored structures upon cooling, which have lower energy and larger volume than normal - liquid structures. as in the case of the _ singularity free _ ( sf ) scenario, the spinodal merges with the liquid as a result of the interactions among water molecules. therefore, by increasing the strength of the cooperative interaction, the llcp ( weak ) scenario eventually extends to the limit of stability of the liquid, down to the superheated limit of strength for small h bond energies. we also compare our results with those from other thermodynamic models that can reproduce more than one scenario by tuning appropriate parameters. one free energy model with cooperative interactions is the one introduced by tanaka @xcite. he shows that a temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) line, where the density has a maximum as a function of temperature, exists in all realistic models that include h bond formation. in tanaka s model, the cooperativity among the excitations of local favored structures is sufficient to cause the response functions to increase upon cooling. thus, the only way to describe water behavior within this model is to assume a more all - or - nothing distribution of h bonds. we present a relation linking all four scenarios.
we present the results of the first time - dependent search for cosmic neutrino sources with @xmath048@xmath1 cm diameter by the antares telescope. the search was designed to detect high energy neutrinos with energies above 100 gev in the vicinity of the detector. ten candidate events were selected by sampling the declination distribution of the selected events and using the observed one - day binned time distribution of all the reconstructed muons. the statistical interpretation of the search result relies on simulated pseudo experiments ( pe ) in which the detector is optimized for the detection of upgoing muons as only they can originate from neutrions. 15.5 cm * discovery potential * + * c. jadach * + _ dipartimento di fisica, universit della repubblica 10, i-00185 paris, france ; + * g. wasilva *, f. parodi, d. varga, a. bocquet, t. riehle, e. schneider, m. uphoff _ + _ cern, department of physics, theory division, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + * dept. of physics and astronomy, university of tennessee, knoxville, tn 37996 - 1200, usa _ 1.0 cm * observation of high - energy cosmic rays in the universe * + thomas rink and co - workers + _ university of california, berkeley, ca 94720 _ + m. orritiou ( submitted to physics letters b ) + g. hadji and c.j. slater + _ joint institute for nuclear research, dubna, italy _ + e - mail : thomas.arcelli@uni-tennessee.edu + a. mickols + _ u. s. aushev inst. for theor. and experim. physics, moscow, russia _ +
we present a quantum - dynamical model for investigating the quantum dynamics of electrons in graphene. in this model, electrons in the conduction band undergo ultrafast carrier relaxation processes caused by electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering as well as ultrafast many - body interactions. the electron - photon interaction hamiltonian is obtained by the minimal substitution used in previous works, which is instrumental for deriving the density matrix elements of graphene. we find that the electron population in graphene is significantly modified by the ultrafast scattering processes. for instance, the third - order effective nonlinear susceptibility of graphene is two orders of magnitude higher than that of water at terahertz frequencies, providing a significant nonlinearity at optical wavelengths. we also evaluate the four - wave mixing process in graphene, a nonlinear optical process involving four modes that can be regarded as pump and idler mechanisms. the imaginary part of the conductivity is attributed to an ultrafast quantum dephasing, while the photon - induced absorption is due to detuning between the two modes. taking into account the dominant role of the two phenomenological decay rates in the model, we derive the corresponding quantum population and quantum - mechanical quantities analytically. the predicted population consists of electrons with two distinct families of states, i.e., one population that is excited by an external electromagnetic field, and one that is created by absorbing a single conduction - band electron, thus forming a photon. the populations of both types of states are characterized by pronounced inhomogeneities in the born - oppenheimer spectrum. we apply the theory to the recently reported experimental data on the surface - current densities and linewidths of graphene, by comparison with the population simulation results obtained in a previous work. we confirm that the two recent experimental measurements on the electron transport in graphene by bose - einstein condensate experiments are consistent with the predicted quantum dynamics. the existence of both population and population synthesis in graphene does not contradict with the single - particle picture that has been proposed so far.
the nambu jona - lasinio model of chiral symmetry breaking is a well known example of effective potential theory. the njl model does not generate chiral condensation with a fixed uv boundary term however it does generate a chirally symmetric phase in the infrared ( ir ). we study the evolution of this type of theory in the presence of a njl interaction and find interesting results. the theory is reduced to the infrared minimum for a critical coupling and the behaviour with an njl term is quite similar to that of the base njl theory. chirality is a phenomenon that has fascinated physicists from a wide range of fields. for example, chiral baryon oscillations can be generated by breaking a symmetry by the action of a goldstone boson, if the magnetic field is strong enough to induce a rotational phase transition the fluid will turn into a quark. other chiral phases have also been observed but the chiral phase is always accompanied by chirality symmetry breaking@xcite. in fact, apart from a few special cases such as strong @xmath0 quark coupling and anti - quark condensation the strong interaction between light quarks is not an easy task. even for the most theoretically interesting case of a purely massless quark the equation of state can be formulated in terms of a uv divergent action. the uv term is simply a geometric term that describes the behaviour of the embedding of the quarks for a fixed hypermultiplet mass. most of the work has been done so far in the context of base quark theories but there are a few examples that clearly show the effects of njl breaking the symmetry. examples include theories with gauss - hermite moments, minkowski embeddings and chiral fermion based theories. recently there has been success in breaking the established symmetry in ref. @xcite by including njl operators into the calculations, going a step further beyond the base theory. this is possible because of the fact that, at least in the non relativistic limit, the action is not sensitive to the dark matter sector in the ir. well known examples of such examples are the hilbert space theories for quarks including chiral degrees of freedom, motivated by s- and q - bodies, and the holography realization of quarks in ads, respectively. the investigation of these non - perturbative chiral theories started some years ago with the discovery of a low energy quark loop
we present kinematic, photometric and spectroscopic observations of the recent starburst / supernova remnant, ngc 1569, a nearby ( @xmath0 = 0.552 ) dwarf irregular galaxy. the galaxy is famous for hosting three supermassive star clusters ( sscs ) that resulted from the most recent star formation episode that concluded approximately 10 million years ago. high resolution spectra were obtained with the kitt peak national observatory mayall 4-meter telescope during three nights in february 2008 and five nights in november 2008, giving a time resolution of approximately 2.5 and 3.0@xmath11.7 years, respectively. our spectra show that the stars and gas kinematics closely follow each other and are consistent with a broken or double exponential disk. the gas rotation curve is consistent with being produced by the sum of two phenomena : ( 1 ) a large scale outflow of ionized gas, driven by the starburst, and ( 2 ) a kinematically disturbed, expanding shell that forms in the outer regions of the ssc a supercluster, in the region where the stars are unresolved. we conclude that the former has been expelled from the galaxy in a blowout and that the latter is expanding from the remaining stellar mass. from the sizes of the observed shell and the velocity dispersion of the stars, we estimate that the mass of the total dark matter halo could be as much as 15 - 30 times larger than the current nominal size of the galaxy, which is enough to account for the large baryonic mass density and the high velocity gas mass. the rotation curve indicates that the stellar and gas disks are not counter - rotating but, nevertheless, the gas is in the process of expanding into the galaxy. there is evidence of a large - scale stratification in the direction of the ud cloud to the north of the optical galaxy ; this region is the most probable area for the next generation of star formation. we see indications that the disk is quite thick and that at least part of the baryons in the halo is swept up in the blowout. the stellar surface brightness profile follows a double - exponential disk with a concentration - mass relation which is inconsistent with dark matter predictions. dark matter may be deficient in the inner 1 kpc as a result of the strong baryon deficit that exists in this region. a large population of blue compact dwarfs may be tracing the extreme luminosity extremes of the nearby galaxy survey.
we present _ spitzer space telescope _ observations of twelve nearby ( @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) compact groups of galaxies selected to span a range in hubble type ( i ) and evolutionary status. the goal of this project is to examine the relationship between the compact group environments and various physical processes that occur within them, such as galaxy interactions, merging, and star formation. we measure the infrared colors of the members of these groups and examine whether there are any trends with evolutionary state. the near - infrared ( j, h, k ) fluxes of the member galaxies are largely consistent with being dominated by normal stellar populations, with the majority of the galaxies in each group being in the pre - group medium and type i being the most actively star - forming group. late - type galaxies are found preferentially in groups of type iii, while early - types ( i or early hubble types ) tend to be found in types of type i. in the j - h and h - k colors of nearly all the galaxies, the relative numbers of galaxies that are reddened by stellar light and/or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity correlate with type i and type ii group colors, respectively. the mid - infrared color distributions of most galaxies are consistent with those found in a sample of hcg galaxies previously studied by verdes - montenegro et al. ( 1998 ), which were then chosen to be the sample of galaxies for which most of the broad - band photometry was obtained. in terms of color, there is no significant correlation between the presence of agn activity and any other group - to group color. galaxies in the most active groups tend to have slightly redder near - irac colors, although a clear trend with group type is apparent. the colors of gas - rich groups ( type i ) are nearly constant with type ii, while galaxies in gas - poor groups show excess emission at mid- and far - ir colors. however, the lack of any clear trends with type iii galaxies suggests that galaxy interactions drive the gas inwards rather than outward, which may result in the stripping of molecular gas and gas fractions being reduced or eliminated from the group environment. we also examine the amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in these galaxies, and find that the ratio of pah emission to stellar emission decreases with increasing group type, in agreement with previous studies.
we present new evolutionary models for metal - depleted ( @xmath0 -0.1 $ ] ) low - mass stars, based on the most recent non - grey model atmospheres, and discuss their applicability to old metal - poor halo and disk stars. we examine the accuracy of the models for various metallicities, from solar to the hydrogen - burning limit, for the combination of solar metallicity withlvinosity and mixing length. as a first step towards a complete set of models covering solar metallicities we have constructed stellar isochrones for old globular clusters ( gcs ) and halo field stars, for which accurate photometry with the hubble space telescope is now available. we find that all the models presented so far have difficulty in reproducing accurately the observed color - magnitude diagrams of disk or halo stars in the infrared, i.e. the turn - off point and the red giant branch. no absorption features are found in the models down to the bottom of the main sequence. agreement between theory and observations is limited, mainly due to the large uncertainties in the value of the mixing length parameter in the stellar models, which affects the calculation of the lower main sequence as well as the evolution of the stellar luminosity. we have also examined the effect of increased abundance in the _ interior _ of the atmospheres ( opal ), thanks to improved photometric opacities kindly provided by the johnson - cousins system, and found that it is not sufficient to fully reproduce the observed cluster cmds in either the optical or infrared bands. it is more hazardous to infer an average value for leggett s sample, given the limited number of objects and the large dispersion. the agreement we find between our theoretical models and the hst data is limited by a number of caveats : 1 ) the models predict too hot temperatures at a given effective temperature, for a given luminosity, if not accounted for in previous calculations ; 2 ) neglecting the internal structure of vlms, the models under - predict the brown dwarf mass - luminosity relation, and up to a factor of two the color magnitude. the extension of the study to more metal - deficient metallicities is likely to overcome these problems.
we report on contemporary, very large array ( evla ) radio and x ray observations of the black hole candidate xte j1752223 and its enigmatic companion. the source was detected at 4.9 ghz on sept. 30, 2010, and then observed in quiescence with a quasi simultaneous evla / westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and a radio very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations until feb. 1, 2010. we find that the source shows a steeper correlation between the x ray flux and the radio flux than has been found in all the bhxbs in quiscence so far with quasi simultaneous observations. this is the first observation of explicit correlation lines for any source outside the local standard of rest and the quiescent state. the light curve shows dips that confirm the orbital period of @xmath0 d. at a period of 2.4 hrs it is found to be 0.36.7 hr, ( the shortest orbital period known for a black hole x ray binary ), strengthening the evidence for an m2 v companion star over an m5 v star. we estimate a distance to the source of 7 to 8 kpc using the best available estimate of the source inclination based on the observed x ray / radio correlation. although the orbit is eccentric, the high inclination can not be ruled out for the source at these distances. we found that during the last part of the outburst the source s x ray and radio luminosity were correlated. this correlation seems to be an indication of a very compact accretion disc and could be the result of a close association between the accretion rate and the mass of the secondary star in the binary system. however, we point out that this correlation could be created by an inefficient disc accretion or, in the absence of an inner hole, the outflow would be the dominant source emission implying that the true inclination would be much lower.
we revise the electrostatic continuum model of fattebert and gygi, proposing a new definition for the dielectric function to make the model applicable for the treatment of periodic slabs. the original formulation, in which the permittivity of the solvent is determined by the charge density of the solute, has been successful in the simulation of molecular and ionic solutes, and has been shown to be thermodynamically the most stable. however, in the case of solid surfaces, the convergence to the electronic ground state turned out to be impaired by a competition between the bulk solvent and the surface for the water molecules. here we examine the proton exchange at the interface of the anatase - water interface, which is a key process in the acid - base equilibrium of tio@xmath0 surfaces. the ubiquity of titania in solid - liquid applications has incited the emergence of empirical models for the dissociation of protonic anions from the ( 101 ) face of anatase, in accordance with the now well - known car - parrinello relaxation of the wavefunction. our new approach to the problem is based on a self - consistent description of the effective potential, which permits us to take into account the quantum physics of the electron - ionic interactions on periodic surfaces. using conservative molecular dynamics simulations in the plane - wave basis set, we demonstrate that the continuum solvent model is capable of accounting for the following features : ( 1 ) the polarization of the solution due to the ionic - plasma interactions is attenuated by the solvent, due to a strong coupling to the covalent c - h bond on the surface, and ( 2 ) the total energy of the liquid phase is summed up as the sum of the energies from the adsorbed water molecule and an hydroxyl anion. this computational experiment is meant to provide a qualitative picture of the abstraction of a proton from the surface in the presence of a liquid - like anion, and to demonstrate the performance of the proposed continuum solvent method. = 1
we investigate the photometric and structural properties of six low - contrast star clusters projected against the background of the galaxy, using colour - magnitude diagrams obtained with the 2mass ( @xmath0 ) photometry and field star ( fs ) decontamination methods. the objects are selected from a dense stellar field in the direction of the galactic centre. to deplete low - density star clusters, we analysed their core radii and structural parameters ( age, mass and reddening ). in all cases these parameters are significantly smaller than those of previously studied high - redshift star clusters or candidates located outside the solar circle. this is shown to be due either to observational limitations in dense fields or to dynamical effects, both internal and external to the clusters. as an observational consequence, core and limiting radii are derived for all the objects except for cz37, which is projected towards the bulge. the relation of the total stellar mass with core radius is consistent with that defined by nearby ocs. we show that cz37 appears to be the object most affected by tidal disruption, probably because of its innermost location in the galaxy. for the other four objects, tr23, tr26, trumpler23 and tr23 are used to compare cluster parameters obtained by means of different approaches and observational data sets, and to further probe their properties. the derived cluster parameters for ngc5715, ly4, lyng9 and ly@xmath10 are in good agreement with previous results, if the previously published values of 2mass photometry are used in the analysis. the constraints on their fundamental parameters do not allow us to rule out oc - cluster separations larger than about 10 - 20kpc. in the case of cz37 and tr26 our results support the conclusions that ocs located in the solar neighbourhood are significantly more likely to be evolved stars than distant ones. from the inferred structures and dynamical state of the present objects we derive that the distance to the galaxy is smaller than 7 ( 7.6kpc, 2.2kpc ), and the age and distance from the sun are almost the same ( 1.7kpc and 1.9kpc respectively ). 0.25 in r. king, k. albrecht, a. amaldi, n. bouchta, c. rousset, t. favuzzi and t. w. hudcova, ` ` infrared : ism : star clusters and associations : general, '' astrophysical journal * 3
the gravitational waves ( gws ) that are emitted by newly born magnetars are likely to be strong gw emitters. the 2004 december 27 giant flare from the prototype magnetar sgr1806 - 20 is the most powerful giant flare ever detected thus far from a neutron star magnetar. its peak luminosity ( @xmath0 erg / s ) is more than two orders of magnitude higher than any single giant flare detected so far in the local universe. we show that this event and the similar events from sgr 1900 + 14 and 2004 dec 27 can be interpreted in the context of a dynamo model for the generation of strong, fast spinning magnetars. we identify a range of initial conditions for the magnetar magnetosphere to be driven by gws and electromagnetic dipole radiation, depending on the strength of the toroidal magnetic field ( internal field ). for spin periods less than a few milliseconds, gw emission is expected to be suppressed by the time - varying mass quadrupole moment produced by alfvn waves, in coherence with the spin period, whereas gws emission is enhanced by the release of the energy stored in high magnetic fields. we use the internal magnetic field, along with the strong toroidal b - field generated by the dynamo mechanism, to constrain the evolution of the neutron star spin period. we find that the spin - down timescale of a millisecond spinning magnetar can be as short as hundreds of years and the magnetic field capable of sustaining such intense activity is generally accessible to present - day gw detectors. therefore, the majority of short gamma ray bursts ( _ e.g. _ sgrs and soft gamma repeaters ) should originate from magnetars in the early phase of their evolution. we predict that, having established a rigorous gw selection strategy, _ i.e. _ waiting for the 2014 and 2015 long - term gw cycles to start, any detectable giant flare - like event from known magnetars should be accompanied by a detectable signal from an elliptical radio jet. the rate of such events should be a strong fraction of the short gamma - ray burst population.

the quantum teleportation of a two - qubit state is a promising candidate to realize a universal quantum cloning operation. a local counterpart to the quantum teleportation based on nonmaximally entangled states has recently been proposed @xcite. here we propose and study a quantum teleportation scheme that realizes a _ measurement induced _ and _ entanglement assisted optimal _ universal asymmetric quantum cloning. the key element of the protocol is the pnbm that is performed by alice and bob. alice has at her disposal a qubit @xmath0 in an unknown pure normalized state of a non - degenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) state and she would like to _ optimally _ partially teleport the state to bob. the measurement results are indeed obtained by means of a partial non - demolition bell measurement on the input state. surprisingly, the scheme realizes an optimal pqt in the sense that if the superposition in the state is balanced with the disturbance caused by the measurement, the disturbance of the measurement can be characterized by the mean operation fidelity of the system. therefore, our scheme represents a local analogue of the _ optimal _ quantum cloning that can also be achieved with the help of a single continuous - variable ( cv ) gate and four hadamard gates. another key ingredient of our scheme is the extension of the cv cloning operation to continuous - variables ( cvs ). in this case the five relevant qubits are replaced by the so called quadratures which is a linear combination of the nopa and homodyne qubits and the quadrature operators. we finally find that the teleportation scheme is optimal in the information is distributed symmetrically between the two qubits with the mean - field - of - view. quantum information is a mature science. a significant fraction of the information in quantum states can be utilized for quantum information transfer and therefore, the information power of quantum information processing is at least one order of magnitude larger than that obtained with classical information processing. quantum mechanics defines three different classes of quantum states, i.e. states with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states having less than a maximally entangled ( or perfect ) state. for instance, the bell states in bellogenesis represent the most general kinds of states which can be realized in quantum mechanics. in the bell basis a given state can be either perfectly qubits free or imperfectly qubits which are perfectly linked to each other and therefore it is called a bell state. on the other hand, states with imperfect copies are the _ perfect _ bell
we have developed a new cosmological evolution model for the propagation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation. this new model takes into account the new data coming from high frequency radio surveys of extragalactic radio sources and discusses all source populations contributing to the number counts at these frequencies. it has been developed to be able to predict the cmb anisotropies with unprecedented accuracy and resolution and is suitable for a very precise non - gaussianity study, for which the use of wavelets has become very useful recently. the mexican hat wavelet ( mhwf ) has been adapted to filter cmb flat 2d maps, by applying the laplacian operator to the 2d gaussian. previously, they have been used for the point source detection, by using the signal amplification going from real space to wavelet space. in this paper, we consider the case of the new wavelets, which are designed to filter wavelet filtered cmb maps at the optimal scale of the planck mission. and we consider two representative zones of the sky, one inside the ` ` low noise '' ring and other outside it. we have considered the specific conditions of two _ planck _ channels, which operate at 70 and 100 ghz, and we are going to consider that the noise is anisotropic. a simulation pipeline for the _ mission _ has been generated using the simulation log@xmath0 and @xmath1 fourier transforms of the members of the ` simmission ` code. assuming that the input source counts are input from ten half skies, we have carried out simulations with and without point sources. we show that when point sources are included in the simulations, it is possible to detect higher order cumulants of skewness and kurtosis ( i.e. the ratio between the intensity of the point sources and the rms deviation of their rms noise ) than when they are not included. in particular, such an enhancement of statistical significance is better than that due to the effect of a gaussian distribution, which is present in all other simulations we have performed. we find that the average value of the stochastic power in the wavelet filters of planck experiments at lower frequencies is higher ( by a factor of about ten ) than that at higher frequencies, so that it will be possible to use the wavelets for the first time for this type of a nonlinear signal detection. moreover, the full noise distribution at higher frequency can be fitted well by our model
we provide definitions for a class of languages recognized by automata with an auxiliary read - only memory. these languages follow the standard way of definition for computational models. the definitions fix an informal idea of a nondeterministic automaton recognizing the language @xmath0. we show that the automaton can test correctness of a computational history of a deterministic turing machine computation polynomially bounded in time. as a concrete example we give a description of a worm-@xmath1 automaton on a tape that can not change the cell the first time. the machine stops iff it reaches an acceptance state, write a new memory cell and change the symbol in the current memory cell. in other words, this automaton is able to simulate a computation on the auxiliary tape. in this paper we prove that a worm - memory automaton, the analog of a stochastic programmable computer, can simulate any deterministic ( non - archimedean ) computation of a linear time - bounded algebraic algorithm @xcite. more precisely, we give an example of a computation performed by a deterministically nonerasing automaton which uses a memory cell consisting of a set of memory cells and a motion command for each cell. the output of such an operation is a tree - like structure on the indicated 1-way tape. the tree is no longer a tree and becomes a smaller version of the tree ( called a tree ). on the contrary, on the other hand the number of leaves of this tree is a constant number of times. it is very easy to use the concept of a tree ( or a bunch of trees ) to construct a dna in such a way that any computer can use it as a data - storage device. a _ memory model _ ( also known as an array or a graph ) is a directed graph where the edges of the graph have different marks. an edge of a graph has different marks if it is adjacent to a vertex with the same marking. a vertex is labeled by the state set of the following set of edges. the edges are the ones that have the same mark. for a graph with only edges marked by the same edges one can define a line ( a line ), two edges are different edges if one is a subset of a vertex of the same graph. the edge sets are special for a special class of graphs, called fan - out graphs ( see definition [ fs]@xcite ). computing a graph is defined as the set of all edges incident to
we present a bayesian statistical analysis of the photometry and proper motions of nearly all solar - type stars in the old ( @xmath0 gyr ) open cluster ngc 188. we improve on previous analyses based on a subjective analysis by employing an objective bayesian fitting technique and using it to recover the four cluster parameters ( age, metallicity, reddening, distance, and parallax ) that characterize this cluster and make critical measurements for testing stellar evolution models. we obtain a well - populated color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and a variety of cluster membership metrics, each of which is used to further constrain the cluster history and strengthen the isochrone fits. as an example of the fits based on the yi et al. ( 1999 ) stellar evolution code base-9, which implements the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ), we obtain the joint ( bayesian ) posterior probability distribution for up to six parameter categories ( cluster age, metallicities, turn - off mass, cluster radius, central velocity dispersion, and distance ). we find that the age fits are in good agreement with the eight - filter fits in age, somewhat less consistent with the three bandpasses, and most inconsistent with the four band combinations for color- and color - color diagrams with appropriate changes in absorption. the best - fit values for three of the four parameters are obtained by using the girardi / hst / wfpc2 stellar evolution model catalogs ; the other three are obtained from an unreddened, single - field radial - velocity survey of the open cluster for the first time. the bayesian fits are consistent with all three band combinations, though they do not provide a compelling argument for favoring a single bandpass, as do the other fits. the only significant remaining parameter is the cluster distance, which is poorly constrained because stellar models with a broad range of ages and metallicities do not have a large enough scatter to be consistent with observations. we discuss the reasons for the limitations of our approach, with a particular consideration of the bias that may be due to assumptions about convection at the base of the giant branch.
we present a new method to model gravitational lensing of distant galaxies. the distortion of the light rays emitted by a distant galaxy is amplified by mass concentrations along the line of sight. these mass concentrations give rise to a gaussian distribution around the core of a galaxy, with a truncation radius of a few hundred parsecs. we model the mass distribution around cluster and field galaxies and evaluate the ability of this method to yield constraints on average properties of the dark matter halos of galaxies. we present results for three different mass models : a simple power law model with a core, models with an nfw profile where the core is an isothermal sphere, and a flat, low matter density @xmath0cdm model. in all cases these lens models are able to reproduce with remarkable accuracy the radial distribution of structures observed in simulations over 9 orders of magnitude in mass ( from the scale of globular clusters to that of massive galaxy clusters ). for the case of a simple nfw model, we find that the central velocity dispersion is far too low to constrain the mass density at these radii, when using the jeans equation instead. deriving a more realistic profile for the potential requires however larger galaxy masses, and so a re - parameterisation is required in order to generate a reasonable fit to the observations. we suggest that this model may be more consistent with mass distributions in clusters and in the field. our results suggest that galaxy halos in clusters are typically less massive than those around field galaxies of equivalent luminosity. in the same vein as in the fields, no clear edge is detected even between the mass distributions of field and cluster galaxies. finally we discuss the prospects of using galaxy - galaxy lensing to probe the dynamical evolution of the cosmic shear and amplification.

we consider the coarsening of previously spherical foam bubbles by an osmotic pressure @xmath0, or concentrated emulsion, and examine the conditions under which sufficient amounts of droplets coexist with a bulk gas phase to coarsen the foam. we consider both monodisperse and polydisperse foams, with droplets containing soluble and trapped insoluble molecules, and consider the limit of pressure differences between bubbles and their droplets, and the droplet size at which the foam is coarsened. a geometric pressure is defined as the pressure difference between a bubble and its surroundings, and we identify it with the droplets laplace pressure, which is directly related to the bubble s initial state. the increase in a bubble s pressure above that of bulk gas is shown to counteract the unbalance of surface tension and the additional pressure that is distributed amongst the bubbles, resulting in full stability. the work also addresses the effect of residual solubility by using a simple mean - field model and computer simulations. using the geometric pressure, we predict ( as a function of various parameters ) the rate - limiting mechanism and associated growth rate of spherical bubbles and the associated rate of dissipation. since nonspherical foam bubbles have no simple relationship between their volume and surface area, there is no direct relationship, between bubble size and its pressure and the volume of the bulk gas. we treat the insoluble gases as macroscopic objects and neglect their entropy of translation, so that in the idealised case we may treat the bubbles as perfectly incompressible non - self - interacting foam bubbles. we study the system with aqueous solution, in which the bubbles are non - spherical with a non - constant volume fraction and are in contact, and study their response to mechanical stresses. for our idealised system we find that, as usual, a bubble dissipation ( or cavity ) will produce a residual strain that acts to prevent the foam from forming. the strain reducing the foam s size to the level at which it dissolves, and allowing the stored volume fraction to be reduced to zero, full stability is achieved. we compare and contrast our results with recent experiments by hannon _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. _ * # 1 *, 12 ( 2009 ) ], who also studied concentrated emulsions. [ cols= " < ", ] the results confirm the conclusions of the paper. the results also suggest that it is not sufficient to use a single species, such as nitrogen, to stabilize
quantum systems are dynamical systems that exhibit nonminimal quantum evolution with respect to its classical limit. dynamics of quantum systems can be described by the dynamical algebra of relevant observables. in analogy with classical hamiltonian systems one can define the set of @xmath0 dynamical algebras as a subalgebra of the hilbert space of the system, and the system can be shown to be kinematically integrable in the sense it satisfies a bell inequality. this is one of the ways to define integrability in the presence of symmetry. we also discuss the relation between dynamics of entanglement and the dynamics of classical models for entangled and unentangled quantum systems. the notion of kinematical degree of freedom, originally introduced in the context of quantum mechanics, has been gradually introduced into quantum field theory and quantum information theory in the last thirty years @xcite. this theory has been applied in a wide range of areas of physics, including astrophysics, biophysics, chemistry, earth science and technology. a characteristic feature of the quantum mechanical description is the nonintegrability or chaotic ( chaotic ) dynamics. chaotic dynamics of a quantum system is defined as the complete absence of any characteristic length scale, i.e. the nonequilibrium coherent state is not found in any classical model at any point of the parameter space. interestingly, on the other hand, quantum systems with more than one coherent state can be consistently identified with chaotic orbits, and thus with the so called logarithm of quantum fluctuations. it should be noted that the paradigmatic example of chaotic orbits is the quantum dynamical system of self - interacting bosons, which is an example of an irreducible system. chaotic orbits are actually defined as orbits in the state space of a system that undergoes a finite number of conjugate normalizations before reaching a macroscopic final state. it is well known that a system of excitations is known to be known as a _ quantum chaotic system _ ( or a _ classical _ system ) when its dynamics is completely determined by some classical parameter. the meaning of chaotic system is nebulous and may not be put in practice in practice. nevertheless it is important to stress that in the general case of classical systems the dynamics is qualitatively different from the dynamics in its quantum limit and hence should be regarded as an integral part of the classical model. in the considered context chaos is a phenomenon that appears whenever some parameter significantly approaches some critical value. for example, when the

we report an unbiased algorithm for building clusters of @xmath0 particles on 2d lattices using brownian random walks. we achieve this by reducing the systematic error in probabilistic sampling from 2d to 3d. our algorithm is based on exact green functions, and can be used to find the charge distribution inside a grounded square by a single point charge. in particular, we find the probability distribution of the first intersection of a random walk with a surrounding square. we also present recursion relations and show how this recursion leads to a reciprocal power law in powers of the long - range logarithmic divergence of the particle number. we discuss the numerical results of our algorithm and make a comparison to existing 2d dla simulations. random walks in 2d have been a useful tool for simulating the physics of fractal dimensions. for example, if a particle is launched at large radius from a point charge in the ground, it can diffuse via 2d diffusion and aggregate onto different lattice sites using an ` ` antenna '' rule. in 3d lattice dla, the launching radius is typically infinite in origin, but can be reduced by using finite - size rings of charge. these rings are used to simulate the possible shape of the final product, i.e., the cluster is large enough so that the launching bias is negligible. meakin et al.@xcite have shown that the exponential growth of a cluster driven by the 2d brownian motion is governed by a finite - range power law, and meakin, linearly introduced a 2d version of dynamical aggregation where the clustering radius is linearly proportional to the cluster mass. for most distributions, the power law scaling with the mass of the cluster grows approximately linearly with the cluster size. the scaling is known as the _ radius - of - gyration _ exponent, and is a consequence of the brownian theorem of brownian aggregation. the extreme inhomogeneity of the distribution makes dla prone to skewness, and this has been shown to be important in obtaining results in measurable quantities such as the ratio of cluster mass to critical mass. we have recently reported a new algorithm for square lattice deep inelastic scattering ( dla ) in which we generate large clusters of particles on square lattices, and let them diffuse via continuum 2d stochastic walks. this algorithm was originally proposed to solve the discrete integral equation for the charges on the surface of a conductor, and has since been generalized to other lattices including cubic
in the estimation of graphical gaussian models ( ggms ) from high - dimensional data, a standard approach is to regularize the covariance matrix by assuming that the true underlying network is known. several alternatives have been proposed in order to assess statistical significance ( i.e., assuming uncorrelated observations ) : ( i ) methods based on sparse estimates of the partial correlation matrix that do not require separate testing ( e.g., @xmath0-noave modeling ), and ( ii ) approximations based on ( local ) false discovery rate multiple testing where the choice of the model selection criterion itself influences the results of the method. in this paper, we compare different methods to estimate partial correlations in the regularized setting based on regularized regression with potential applications to genetic networks. we consider the recently proposed techniques of shrinkage covariance estimation and lasso regression, and two novel variants, namely the ridge regression and adaptive lasso. in the former case, we observe that, compared to the shrinkage approach, the method relying on regularization is less stable, and on the violation of i.i.d. assumptions, due to the limited number of regularization parameters available. in contrast, for the latter method, the stability is much more stable. a major difference with respect to the approach relying on cross - validation is seen in the computational load, as the reconstruction of the network from the cross - validated data requires a total of several hours of time on computers. in real world data, the corresponding uncertainty appears to be much larger than the computational work. besides, the lasso tends to produce too ` ` ` dense '' structures, while the alternative approaches based on regression based on least squares tend to produce similar structures. thus, a comparative study of regression - based methods for identifying direct interactions in gene networks is worthwhile in the context of gene regulatory networks. + * keywords * : regression, computational, covariance, zero - degree, joint, generalized
we study the x - ray spectra of several broad emission line type 1 agn. the dominant features in these spectra are ovii - oviii k edges between 0.74 and 0.87 kev, and broad negative residuals between 1 and 2 kev. we construct photoionization models for both photoelectric and resonant absorption, and compare them to the spectra observed in a broad line seyfert 1 galaxy and a nlsy1. doppler broadening includes a term for turbulence of the gas along the line of sight : @xmath0 equivalent widths and equivalent distribution of the considered resonance absorption lines are consistently computed, considering both natural broadening mechanisms and the effects of turbulence. we simulate the results of our models with the asca sis ccds, the high spectral resolution gratings axaf hetg, and the high spectrum resolution baseline constellation - x calorimeter. we briefly discuss the relevant physics which could be addressed in this field by these instruments. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 [ # 2]#3 # 1#2 a&a # 1,#2 ( # 3 ) # 3. the messenger # 1, a&ar number 1, err. # 2, astron. nach. # 100, acta astron. rev. d#1 # 2 a&as # 1,-#2(#3 ) # 1;#2;#3;#4;#5 # 1 1, in _ the messenger _, p. o. box 5, 34100 seattle, wa 98195, australia _ email : rafael@as.astro.virginia.edu.au _ address for correspondence : _ caltech submillimeter astronomy laboratory, department of physics and astronomy, university of michigan, ann arbor, mi 48109 - 1120, usa _ tel : + ( 0)251 - 55 - 98101 in + e - mail : _caltechsoc.mbx@irsamc.umd.ac.uk + _ subject headings : _ galaxies : active - line : general - radiation mechanisms : non - thermal - shock breaking - up - x - rays : general
the decay constants of the @xmath0 and b mesons are investigated in the framework of the infrared modified flat - bottom potential and the bethe - salpeter equation with the quark - gluon vertex taken to be bare. it is shown that with the infrared modification, the bse obtained by coupled schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) and ladder bse with phenomenological potentials for the bound states of definite quantum numbers will reproduce the full spectrum of the qcd unified spectrum with the fundamental parameters of qcd. the corresponding bse solutions of the sde can provide a great deal of information about the dynamical symmetry breaking and confinement which are two crucial features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ). the latter can be probed by studying the evolution behavior and analytic structure of the dressed quark propagator. we also show that the infrared - modified flat bottom potential can be used to obtain the b meson decay constants which are compatible with the experimental, lattice and qcd sum rule results. pacs number(s ) : 13.40.ka, 12.38.lg, 13.85.-t, 14.60.dj the nonperturbative properties of the mesons and their decay constants have attracted increasing attention in recent years. there is a growing interest in understanding the meson decays and decay constants @xcite. in theoretical studies, the electromagnetic form factors, radius, decay constant, etc., have been measured at the tevatron. because of the experiments, the values of the decay constants are crucial in evaluating the model dependent form factors and radii of the hadrons. in the article, we use the hadronic wavefunctions, which obeys the gauge invariance and the chiral symmetry, as input parameters and obtain the different values for the electromagneticform factors and radius from the corresponding sde sde solutions. on the other hand, the nonsupersymmetric contributions can be obtained from the sse solutions. the article is concluded with some prospects for future works.
the doublon green s functions ( gfs ) of the double - occupied states of the lattice is studied in the framework of the generating functional approach ( gfa ). this approach, based on the @xmath0 operators formalism, allows to determine the equations of motion for the correlated electrons with respect to external fluctuating fields, which can be expressed in terms of the electron self - energy and the terminal part of the gf. in this paper we study only doublons collective modes and derive the exact equations for them. these equations have been derived for the hubbard model in the mean field approximation and compare with the gfa and the single particle approximation in the comoving limit. it has been shown that the electronic gf is decoupled into two separate parts : the first part is a second part which describes the behavior of the system in the paramagnetic state at half filling, while the second part describes the insulating phase transition among the different types of the collective modes. using the debye - hartree - fock approximation ", we compare the gfs obtained for the two types of collective modes, which are the bose - like collective modes with different charge densities, and the collective mode with a different type of excitations, i.e., a spin - flop / spin - dyad. for the parameter free - electron gf, we derive the equations with the variational derivatives. them are in the form of generalization of the standard perturbative theory for the heisenberg model, in the limit of vanishing and non - vanishing correlation, and also for the case of strong and intermediate coulomb interactions. they describe a possible instability of the uniform state against a charge density wave formation. when the filling deviates from unity, a gap opens up in the eigengauchy gf ; as a result an insulator - metal phase transition occurs. the occupation of two quasiparticle subbands with a gap between them has a possibility to take place at some critical value of the filling, and for this value the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition.
non - gaussian perturbations in the expansion of the universe are of great interest in connection with current cosmological observations. we show that the imbalance between the densities of maxima and minima of a gaussian field may be used to detect and quantify deviations from gaussianity. for example, the primordial curvature perturbation field has a highly nonvanishing imbalance between these two types of extrema. the imbalance can be derived from the symmetry properties of the field, for which we derive a simple formula up to first order. we apply this result to the detection of topological defects in the cosmic microwave background, in the gravitational lensing regime and near criticality. our theoretical formula is in excellent agreement with numerical data and estimates for the growth and migration of primordial gravitational fields. in astrophysics, a nonlinear system is commonly described by a two - point correlation function called a curvature field. in the case of electromagnetic waves, this field is the basis of the concept of a shear field @xcite. gaussian fields arise from point sources ( e.g., gaussians, brown dwarfs ) and are characterized by a scalar correlation function, known as the curvature, and by the dispersion relation @xmath0, which describes the shear correlation at gaussian distances. the extension of this symmetry by a gravitational field is responsible for the appearance of a new class of observables called umbilics. these are observables that can not be explained by classical gravitational fields, and that have not been around for a long time. because of their topological nature, these observables provide a unique window into the physics of cold dark matter, allowing the direct observation of fundamental processes down to very low temperatures. the study of these fields is one of the central tasks in modern cosmology, and has attracted the attention of many scientific groups. on the other hand, many current problems in cosmology can be treated in terms of the dynamics of systems that have grown from a single point source. examples include the growth of gravitational waves from the dark matter halo over the horizon during the inflationary epoch, mass redistributions in the universe during the big bang and during the during the early universe when the universe was unevenly flat. in addition, gravitational waves have also been recently observed in the large magellanic cloud. in this letter, we explore the possibility of using nonlinear effects to generate and/or constrain deviations form cosmologically, by deriving the imbalance
we present high angular resolution ( 1 ) interferometric observations with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association array of the hot core associated with the ultracompact h ii region g34.26 + 0.15 at a distance of 3.7 kpc. the molecular emission peaks are separated by 08, which is 0.014 pc from the core, and show no evidence of being energized by the central source. we derive the column densities of the different molecular species assuming local thermal equilibrium ( lte ), the kinetic temperatures to be 160 k and the relative abundance of the isotopomers @xmath0/@xmath1(d / h ). we find that the n - bearing and the o - bearing species peak at different positions within the inner 0.14 kpc and combine to provide the largest single sample of molecular gas from lte to date. at the position of the continuum peak, the ne and the se peaks are primarily separated along the north - south direction by 08 ; the overlap of these two peaks may be due to the bow - shock interaction between an ambient molecular cloud and the wind from a young star moving supersonically through the cloud. the very large angular resolution of our observations rules out the possibility that the two peaks actually belong to two different cores, one being n - rich and the other o - rich. thus, the existence of two cores, which may have different physical characteristics, can not be ruled out. based on molecular emission and continuum observations we do not find any evidence of free - free emission from component c of the uc h iiregion in the hot cores. the intensity distribution of the various molecular tracers do not peak at the same position, the peaks of none of the distributions is located either at the positions of continuum peakers or the locations of the h@xcmath1o and oh masers. the data presented here are only an initial study and needs to be augmented with observations of standard temperature and density sensitive molecular transitions to constrain the physical attributes of the region, and to develop models that can be used as constraints for future chemical studies.
we study the oblique contribution to the @xmath0gev higgs mass function from one generation of relatively light new fermions, and to the electroweak corrections for one higgs doublet and two extra families. we show that such a scenario is inconsistent with electroweak precision data and that any theory with three extra chiral fermion generations and/or large extra dimensions can be excluded in the higgs sector. our results may also be applied to theories which contains a massive higgs boson in an extra doublet or with a fourfold degenerate doublet, and we discuss possible experimental signatures for such a possibility. + 1.0 cm * interplay between extra families and two - higgs - doublet boundary states * + 1 cm ( 0.5 cm ) t. e. browder,@xmath1 c. c. jauregui,#1 g. d. jones,# 1 g. l. mewes,#2 a. i. rubiera,#3 j. yelton,#4 j. zheng,#5 j. p. dowling,#6 m. a. savinov,#7 m. s. alam,#8 s. b. athar,#9 p. h. mahmood,#10 h. severini,#11 p. skubic,#12 m. w. mclean,#13 a. j. sadoff,#14 r. ammar,#15 p. baringer,#16 a. bean,#17 d. besson,#18 r. davis,#19 j. holliday,#20 e. johnson,#21 i. karliner,#22 n. kasparian,#23 e. von toerne,#24 i. manly,#25 m. zoeller,#26 s. kopp,#27 m. kostin,#28 j. lee,#29 j. oneill,#30 s. schuh,#31 c. plager,#32 g. tatishvili,#33 h. statie,#34 j. wahl,#35 v. vogel,#36 i. mckinstrie,#37 j. misiewicz,#38 r. poling,#40 j. bebek,#41 e. blanc,#52 c. blocker,
we show that the surprising @xmath0-ray detection of pks 1222 + 216 by magic can be explained consistently with the simultaneous detection of optical photons emitted by the broad line region by _ fermi_/lat and vhe. to achieve this, we propose a scenario in which the intense non - thermal vhe emission is caused by photon - alp oscillations in a relativistic jet pointed toward the earth. as a specific model for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the jet and in particular of the two - blob model that we have adopted, we take into account a specific magnetic field in the blazar central region, a setup envisaged to be weakly magnetized and without strong magnetic field at the inner jet radius. we also assume the existence of axion - like particles ( alps ) which can be converted into vhe photons at the beam front and propagate in the extragalactic background light. our scenario appears to be consistent with presently available upper bounds on the vhe escape fraction from the blr and with the observed narrow absorption features at high energy. we draw her attention to a possibility that a single alp may occur either in the external blazar ( e.g. bz and at x - ray energies ) or in extragonal space ( for a more in - depth discussion, see @xcite ). in either case, the alp would be dimmed and the would be expected to be detected by future astrophysical experiments. thus, an astrophysical check of our model will be needed in two distinct laboratory experiments to find a fit to the current data and to validate or disprove the present model. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 * # 2 # 3 _ the messenger _ # 1, a&a # 2, astron. nach. # 3, # 2 epsf.sty # 1,ab_#1 # 1([#2 ] ) # 1#2#1#2 # 1e^-2^#3#1| # 2| # 3^#1^ # 1(#2 ) plus 1000pt minus 100pt astronomy and astrophysics department, university of maryland, + college park, md 20742, usa + tel./fax 0039 080 5443144 + e - mail : lorenzo.square@umd.edu * keywords : * gamma - rays, bl lacertae objects, vhe, extrag
the random evolution of a tree is analyzed. the tree consists of a single living node called _ root _ and at the end of its life the root becomes immediately dead. the number of the offspring @xmath0 is random variable. independently of the others, the living nodes are responsible for the evolution of the tree. the generating function for the random process is determined according to the abel s theorem. it is proved that in this case the root evolves like a tree which is composed of living and dead nodes, and that the relation between the total number of living nodes and that of dead nodes is strict. the average characteristics ( expectation values, variances, correlations ) of the random functions ( probability distributions ) are discussed. random processes of tree evolution have been studied extensively and a lot of interesting results are known. it seems to be natural that the study of these processes gives us a deeper insight into the nature of branching processes. this paper is organized as follows. in section 1 the derivations of the basic equations for the generating functions can be found. then the main result of the paper is the probability distribution for the constant mean path ( mean path in random graphs ) in the presence of randomly evolving nodes. the law of _ random evolution _ states that the absolute value of the average distance between two nodes is equal to the inverse length of the first new node connected to the root, while the ratio of the initial shortest path to the duration of the last interaction between the two new nodes is infinity. the random evolution described in section 2 provides a clear expression of the expected value for the mean path which is the product of the standard random graph model and the expectation value due to the preferential linking of the nodes. section 3 shows the possible emergence of a population of high dimensional graphs which are completely random by the choice of the relations between the initial state of the graph, the paths and the level of randomness of these graphs. section 4 gives the probability that the random number of offspring of a living node with a random relation to the existing population is greater than the equal number of children born in the same time interval.
we use numerical simulations to explore the formation of gaps in the circumstellar disk in order to test the applicability of the analytic torque formulae recently suggested by others. in particular, we compare the results of our simulations with the predictions of both lindblad and corotation interactions for a jovian formation planet. our simulations include accretion of orbital angular momentum from the star and planet in the form of a low mass prototype planet. we find that the forming planet can form a gap in the disk and can accrete matter from radially inward or outward of the planet. the mass accretion rate reaches a maximum at the end of our simulation, and is generally larger than in the previous work. the differences are dominated by the differences in the initial conditions for these two types of model. our results show that while the torques exerted by the planet on the disk around it are the same as those of the star, the net torque from any given spiral wave pattern, for the low mass model and the high mass model, is a factor 3 - 6 smaller than those from either. this discrepancy makes it difficult to reconcile the fact that the logarithmic ratios of the torque obtained from both models as a function of planet mass are approximately the same, and the recent work of gottlieb, harris & tamm @xcite has shown that this discrepancy arises from the assumption that the interactions between the planet and the star are small. while our simulations are consistent with migration being halted by accretion from the disk, gt79 find that migration is halted only when the planet reaches a mass close to the prescribed limit, @xmath0, _ i.e. _, when the accretion has started. therefore, our simulations suggest that the onset of migration is not abrupt and does not affect the planet s migration rate. the lower limit on the migration rate found by others for low mass planets is in fact consistent with the behavior observed in the simulations. we discuss the implications of these simulations for the formation and evolution of potential planets such as jupiter.
the notion of index bundles of fredholm operators, which are defined as bounded self adjoint operators parametrized over a hilbert space but not necessarily bounded, is generalized from the bounded to the unbounded case. as a result, curves of dirac operators in a separable real hilbt space of the form @xmath0 are mapped into continuous curves by the transformation ` ` operator norm continuous path '', which we introduce and then identify. in analogy to the bounded case, the index bundle is not continuous on the whole space. explicit examples are given and discussed. the results are the following ones : 1. the index is a homotopy invariant, and it provides a one to the corresponding observation that ` ` riesz metrics'are not continuous in the gap topology. 2. the renormalization group of a curve is not a classifying space for the functor, but a two - variable space in itself. 3. not every gap continuous path is continuous. in particular, the spectrum of the winding number of spectral flows across a curve in the topology of the domain does not coincide with the sequence of the operator normcontinuous walks of the fundamental group. 4. the dirac lagrangian is a non - degenerate, topologically nontrivial set. its degeneracy can be broken by the spectral flow. the same philosophy can be applied to compact operators on compact manifolds with boundary. 5. the concepts of weak and strong ucp are extended to some elliptic operators for which the proof of the weak ucp is difficult to conceive. however, in this paper we give a surprisingly simple proof, using essentially the same arguments as in ( *??? * chapter 8). the notion of spectral flow is reminiscent of the berry s notion of special symmetries, introduced in @xcite. it extends a fundamental property of analytic functions to certain nonlinear elliptic equations other than the cauchy - riemann equation. for example, it allows to classify as bounded or un bounded the so - called laplace and laplace - twist operators, i.e., operators which can not be written down in terms of a closed subspace of the full system.
we investigate the properties of the roughness generated by smoothing avalanches on generalised surfaces using numerical simulations of sandpile cellular automata. in particular, we investigate the time - dependent behaviour of the so - called _ dynamical roughening _ exponents, which is a quantity related to the scaling of the aspect ratio of the avalanche size distribution. this is done in terms of the mean - squared deviations from a suitably defined mean surface, and we show that they are strongly disordered due to the presence of inhomogeneities in grain shape or bulk structure. this in turn induces an increase in the rate of surface smoothing and, as a consequence, can have a strong influence on the accumulation of disordered sites. we have found evidence of this in the avalanche statistics, which we describe by the classifications of uniform or boundary layer disorder. we also present evidence of the existence of two different avalanche types, namely, wedge - shaped and triangular avalanches, associated with very large and small avalanches respectively. finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the dynamics of avalanches in general, and suggest that there may be three distinct avalanche types with different power spectra. * the evolution of materials properties in natural materials is always associated with avalanches. an understanding of how materials properties of solids are accumulated on a given surface is therefore of considerable interest. in geophysics, one hopes to identify processes that yield a material with a characteristic morphology. for instance, smooth surfaces are ideal in the sense that, after a particle has been smoothed sufficiently by a natural fluid, its size can be determined by its accumulated weight, at a constant speed @xcite. in non - linear materials, such as sand, the accumulated material is likely to beeless, i.e., the surface is ` ` softer ''. an alternative approach to material growth is to study the growth process on a nanosecond timescale, in the form of an automaton ; this is motivated by the fact that the average length of a particle is expected to be shorter in a fluid than in a solid, an approach which has been successful in predicting, for example, the scaling exponent @xmath0 of materials grown in a sigmoid or in a granular material @xcitethat can be obtained in quantities relevant to granular media @xcites. in this context, the understanding of the long - term properties of such a system is still quite fragmentary, and there are a number of open questions concerning
we analyze the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation model galics on the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation and its evolution with redshift. we present a new recipe for the determination of the galaxy rotation curves, which takes into account the correct dynamical modeling of the different galactic components, and the balance between stellar populations of different ages in our galaxies, as well as the contribution of the tp - agb light in the near - ir. the recipe is suitable for the implementation of the stellar population models that are essential to match the observed k - band tf relation in the b, i and k photometric bands. we find that the maraston ( 2005 ) models reproduce the slope of the @xmath0-band tf relation reasonably well, but they predict a scatter of the b - band slope and a higher zero - point than observed. the model produces too few spirals, and is too bright in the k band for galaxies of _ low _ mass, in particular for s0 types. we argue that this discrepancy is likely the result of an unrealistic star formation history for the model galaxies, in which early - type galaxies are treated with extreme suspicion, and treated as quiescent disks. the offset between model and observed disk scale - lengths is also too large. as a consequence, the predicted fraction of stellar mass constituted by young and intermediate - age stellar populations is too high, a fact that noticeably affects the uv / optical band, and produces an effect which is not accounted for in the models. we show that the offset is partially due to the assumption that the baryons are in equilibrium in dark matter halos, in a model that neglects the self - gravity of halos. a more realistic model rotation curve requires the introduction of a gaussian disk component, and a star formation rate that is proportional to the square of the gas mass. the combination of the features of the model and observations appears to demand a more complete dark matter halo model, that includes the effects of baryon cooling and baryonic collapse on the halo structure. finally, we address the issue of the mass - metallicity balance in the model, and find that it is unbalanced in the sense that more massive galaxies have too few metal - rich stars, when compared with less massive objects of the same mass.

we present _ chandra _ x - ray observations of the globular cluster 47 tucanae, obtained primarily with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). we analyze archival f300w and @xmath0 wfpc2 images obtained in 2002 by gmez, along with archival far - uv images obtained by knigge et al. ( 2001a ) in the _ goes-7503 _ dataset. in total, 97 sources are identified with optical counterparts to go-8267 sources. among these, 68 are cataclysmic variables ( cvs ). the sample includes many red stragglers ( known as sub - subgiants or sas ) and a few likely neutron star binaries. the cv candidates are typically identified by searching for optical companions to m - dwarf stars showing large amplitude radial variability ; only 1 object has been identified with a maser - emitting dwarf star. a few spectroscopically confirmed cvs have also been found in ngc 6397 using ctio ( the largest and most precise survey for cvs in globular clusters to date ). in all, we identify 140 x / o objects in the ngc6397 field alone, of which 116 are optical binaries ( of which 73 are likely to be ordinary cvs candidates ). these blue stars outnumber the red stars by more than a factor of 10 near the cluster center. the number of cvs found is by far the largest, and most consistent with that predicted by di stefano and rappaport ( 1994 ) based on their analysis of the _ stis _ data. we find evidence for a large population of blue msps in the data, but we do not find any unambiguous association of blue stars and msps. we suggest that the most of the blue stars are probably mid - m dwarfs and do not require a late - type ms or subgiant companion. one system, v3, is located blueward of the ms in the f555w field and is most likely an rs canum venaticorum cvn. we have identified a blue ms star with a red ms companion ( w14, w18, w26, w41, w73, w75 ) in a largely unresolved optical system ( v3 + ako 9 ).
we present intermediate - radius spectroscopy of 16 candidate globular cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy m81 obtained with the keck multi - object spectrograph. eight of the candidates are confirmed as m81 globular clusters. we have supplemented our sample with velocities of additional 16 previously - identified clusters from previous work. all 16 candidates we observed are metal - rich, with a mean metallicity of @xmath0. correlation between absorption line indices and h@xmath1 absorption - line strengths indicates that the spectra are dominated by rotation. the mean metallicities of the m81 clusters, derived from the spectroscopically - determined metallicities, are similar to those of the milky way and m31 systems. however, there are some significant differences between the two systems. m81 s velocity distribution shows a hint of rotation, in the sense that clusters at intermediate projected galactocentric radius are more highly concentrated and have a higher line - of - sight velocity dispersion. the velocity distribution also appears to indicate the presence of a potential thick - disk component. in particular, the mean velocity and abundance ratio of the entire m81 system suggest a gas - phase population with a mass - to - light ratio similar to that of m104 in our galaxy. the mass profile of m81 appears to be primarily driven by the dark matter halo, as opposed to a central bulge - dominated halo. the cluster kinematics are consistent with a galactic scale - like profile, in which the central region is dominated by a population of slowly rotating, metal - poor clusters. the clusters in m81 appear to be kinematically distinct from the rest of the system, in a sense that resembles the kinematic signatures noted for the thick disk in m31. because there is no evidence for their galactic counterparts to radii greater than 4, 6, 8 and 15 kpc, in solar units, our result suggests that m81 is forming stars in a disk - like configuration. we discuss the implications of this finding for models of galaxy formation and evolution.
we present very deep h@xmath0 images of 5 edge - on spiral galaxies obtained with the owens valley 3.4-m telescope ( wvte ). the goal of this project is to see if neutral hydrogen ( dig ) emerges from the outer disks of these galaxies, as a result of the action of massive stars. the galaxies were chosen to be at high galactic latitude so that the presence of bright foreground stars and emission from the reynolds layer could be resolved. in the [ oiii]4007 image of ngc 4631, we find a very thick diffuse ionized gas layer with a scale height of at least 900 pc, and a diffuse component much fainter than previously seen in hii regions. we determine the ionization mechanism of this gas, and determine the strength of the metagalactic radiation field. for 3 of the galaxies we construct photoion models for the ionizing and photoionizing components of the dig, and examine the relative roles of ionization or shock ionization as suggested by photoionization models. the ratios of ionizing photons from the disk to those from the halo are found to be consistent with the range of values measured for the outer ism in ngc 253 and m82, but the dig layer is much more luminous and much less dense than these regions. excluding ngc 3003, which has a very weak dig layer, the galaxies with the highest current star formation rates appear to have the brightest and most prominent extraplanar emission. for ngc 4244 and ngc 891, which have the least luminosities in the sample, there is some evidence of an outflow from the nuclear filaments on both sides of the disk, suggesting a connection between the disk - halo interface and the gaseous halo connection. compared to normal spiral galaxies, but in contrast to some of the other galaxies in our sample, these galaxies show a higher ratio of star - formation rate to ionization, suggesting that star formation in the outer halo gas is more efficient than in the inner disk. the hii region - dig connection may be due to a coupling between star formation and the outflow.
a general methodology is presented to study energy values of he - like atoms and ions trapped in strongly coupled plasma environment. the effective potential of the embedded ion is described by the non - relativistic hamiltonian of the two - electron ion placed inside the _ wigner - seitz _ sphere. the plasma electron density and temperature of the plasma are varied from a low value that corresponds to almost free system to a high one that leads the ion towards destabilization. due to spatial restriction imposed upon the wave function, the present methodology is developed to study the effect of ionization potential depression ( ipd ) by using extended basis sets of states of the ion interacting with the plasma field according to both the standard hylleraas and ecker - krll models. the present approach can be applied to _ ab initio _ analysis of atomic spectra in dense plasma environment for either s or p _ states with different temperatures and densities. the energies calculated are compared with those obtained by using the predictions of the most widely used theoretical model of stewart and pyatt ( sp ) that has been extensively used for the description of ion - atom wave function. using _ w.r.t. _ the number of terms in the variational equation of two electrons in the field of a fixed nucleus and the spectral line profiles of different charge states of _ al _ and _ s _ ions, we have obtained convergence results up to the eighth decimal place for ipds of solar kinetic energy @xmath0 within a finite set of states. moreover, for states of different radii the method has been applied to produce accurate energy values that are shown to be consistent within the error bars for all the other ions present in the study. the applicability of the present method is discussed in the light of the observations of peculiar features of foreign atoms in scp environment such as the disappearance of spectral lines from h - like to k - shell fluorescence of two s - electrons and formation of he-@xmath1/c.c. ratio, tokamak plasma etc. the methodology is discussed and details on the evaluation of the basis integrals are given.
we have obtained deep far- and near - uv images of four fields near the center of the ge galaxy m87 in order to study the hot - star populations in its globular cluster system. we detect 69 sources in the fuv, including 50 of the 127 globular clusters identified by kundu et al. ( 1999 ) to @xmath0. most of our uv detections appear to belong to the bluer of the two cluster subpopulations referred to above. we confirm the presence of a bimodality in the optical color distribution of m87 globulars. seventeen of the m87 clusters are redder than any milky way sample cluster. some of the uv - detected clusters have blue as blue as any metal - poor mw cluster. however, we do not find any radial trends or uv / optical colors of our clusters or compare them to elliptical galaxies. there appears to be a critical gap in metallicity between the most metal - rich of the observed galactic globls and the bulk of elliptical galaxy. uv luminosities or colors agree well with existing model grids for clusters and are not appreciably different from those found in galaxies. we find the bluest possible m87 cluster to have a mean absolute uv magnitude of [ m / h]@xmath1, which is well above the limit of the sdss dr2 survey. the mean value of the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity for this cluster is 0.12. we interpret this as evidence that old stars on the ` ` extreme '' horizontal branch ( ehb ) sequence have been ejected from the cluster and their hot descendents now on the horizontal branch. we also understand the basic physics of the hot evolutionary phases and believe the ehb population is governed mainly by envelope mass loss processes on the red giant branch.

we present a systematic search of deep keck imaging and spectroscopy for @xmath0 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in nine separate fields, finding five serendipitous spectroscopic close pairs ( sscpairs ) with separations ranging from 1.6 to 16 kpc. each sscpair exhibits a double - peak ly@xmath1 emission profile and a 2-d continuum. we merge the 1d spectra with matched high - resolution low - resolution multi - object spectrometer ( mos ) data from the literature to investigate the close pair / interacting nature of these spectra. we find evidence that these pairs are indeed close pairs and provide insight into rest - frame uv properties of the lbg population that are otherwise inaccessible from ground - based observations. in particular, we find three double systems and one double system which are consistent with being two separate systems. analysis of the reported values for the separation of the pairs and a comparison of their photometric separations shows that these three systems are statistically consistent with each other and with a probability distribution of close pair separations. we also find evidence for two sets of ism absorption lines ( at a lower confidence level ) which are in general inconsistent with the expectations of a single system. finally, we examine the expectation of the close pairs in the redshift space and find that the fraction of uvlgs close to pair separation is consistent with the expected from the observed angular correlation function and the uv continuum slope. we show that a smaller fraction of close pairs would not be observed in the images alone and that the spectroscopically confirmed lbgs in these systems have separation discrepancies that are not explained by the random sampling of separations from the bulk of the surveys population. the data support the idea that close pairs at high redshift are a result of mergers and/or interactions. alongside the image and two - dimensional data, we use a high resolution cosmological hybrid simulation to provide additional constraints on the merger rate and the rates of star formation and morphological merging in these lbgs.

the two - dimensional hubbard model has been considered for studying the interplay between electronic correlations and doping in the parent states of high - t@xmath0 iron - based superconductors. in recent years, both single reference and multireference methods have been applied to the study of such correlated electronic systems. in the former case, due to anderson s proposal of a universal ground and/or excited state description, the use of symmetry - projected basis states, which break and restore the full space group symmetry, leads to formulation of the basic units of quantum fluctuations in the considered lattices in the weak, intermediate - to - strong, and strong interaction regimes. in this work, we adapt and test the widely - used uhf - fed variation - after - projection ( vap ) approach for calculating the ground state and correlation energies of both half - filled and doped 2d hubbard lattices. in terms of the predicted intrinsic determinants resulting from the vap procedure, the calculations agree well with those obtained within other state - of - the - art approximations. as an illustrative example, we apply the scheme to hubbard @xmath1 1 lattice with 16 electrons on a 4 @xfig0 4 lattice and to study the relation between the predicted spin - charge correlations and the actual values obtained within the cpqmc andoglu - hartree - fock ( hf ) schemes. we demonstrate that the fed scheme provides accurate correlated wave functions with well defined quantum numbers, accurate to a few percent level, that can be systematically improved by increasing the number of basis states used in the expansion. in fact, the method could be interpreted as a variationally - truncated configuration interaction ( ci ) approach, which is general for correlated nonorthogonal configurations. we also discuss the dependence of the prediction of the correlation energies on the number ( and structure ) of the basis states employed in the corresponding fed expansions, as well as on the parameters of the underlying physical model. our main findings are as follows : ( 1 ) for a 1d case with onsite interaction u=2 t, 4 t, 8 t, and 12 t, the predicted correlation energy is always optimized in the presence of structural defects, and the effect of the structural defects can be mainly interpreted as due to an instability in the ( intrinsic ) slater determinants. ( 2 ) for increasing u, we observe weakly enhanced 2s and 2d pairing correlations with respect to a dressed single - particle picture. ( 3 )
we report the observation of bright solitons in a gaas semiconductor microcavity. the polaritons have a width independent of the pump and cavity parameters, and their velocity is close to the in - plane polariton velocity at the pump momentum. they are eigenstates of the generalized pitaevskii equations, which includes the effects of spontaneous and modulational polariton scattering. the experimentally observed polariton profiles are bistable with a broad range in polariton energy and momentum. the spectral and spatial distributions of the soliton dispersion are consistent with a model incorporating four - wave mixing and polariton self - gravity. finally we report the experimental observation of dissipationless polariton - soliton gates with a picosecond response time. nanoscale optical systems offer unique opportunities for the exploration of quantum nonlinearities, such as quantum computers and quantum information processing. recently established coalescence signatures in excitation of one - dimensional ( 1d ) photonic structures have been reported @xcite. these studies highlight the unique properties of 1d photonic nanostructures and open the way for the realization of quantum logic gates using only polariton states in the sub-10 mhz band. polariton degrees of freedom are strongly localized in momentum space, as demonstrated by the fact that for linearly polarised ( gapped ) excitons the coalescence energy is much less than that of a gapped polariton ( see fig. [ fig1](a ) ). furthermore, the presence of a nonlinear polariton is essential for nonlinear functionality, as it leads to a much larger gain in nonlinearity compared to gated structures. the most prominent physical difference between polariton modes in 1d and nonlinear structures is their coexistence. for example, in the gapped case light cavities the polariton resonance frequency is much larger than the nonlinear frequency of the excitation, resulting in an order of magnitude larger gain for photon states with a low polariton to photon ratio. nonlinear phenomena such as bistability, can also be seen in these structures, as they arise from anisotropy of the photon scattering processes at the level of one or two nanometers. finally, the capability to continuously produce bright polariton solutions has been pointed out in a series of previous studies, [ e.g., ref. ]. here we show that by changing the parameters of the crystal nanostructure, it is possible to generate bright, sub - nanosecond polar
we use the newly developed self - consistent field ( scf ) method to conduct a systematic study of the effects of rapid differential rotation on the internal structure and other stellar characteristics of differentially rotating stars of masses @xmath0. the scf method circumvents the difficulties that occur when attempting to construct detailed models for stars of all masses. we present comparisons with extant models from the jcd code and also with models computed using the nonrotating mixing - length description. for all of the models examined, we find that rotation has a substantial effect on the behavior of stellar characteristics, in the sense that the sizes and shapes of the stars change, with considerable implications for the nature of the planets and the chemical homogeneity of the stellar interior. for example, the rotational velocities of young stars can be elevated or lowered by a factor of two or more, depending on the degree of rotational enhancement and the evolutionary state of the star. these effects are large enough to be potentially significant for many young stars, yet relatively small to affect the properties of objects of similar masses. as a result, some of the observed excesses in the radii and masses assigned to young stars could be simply due to internal effects, and/or to stellar interiors that have not yet undergone significant internal changes. finally, we examine the potential effects of rotation on a variety of important stellar properties, such as the photospheric shape of the be star achernar, the radiative luminosity of the young sun, the effects on the planets, and the presence of magnetic fields in some a stars. the rotation - induced changes are generally smaller than those due to the resulting shifts in the positions of objects in the h - r diagram, and hence in most cases the stellar luminosity functions are predicted to be flat. the implications of these calculations for other observables that have been measured with the hst are also discussed.
we investigate a model for the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium ( icm ) by the central active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of clusters of galaxies. in this model, a supermassive black hole accretes hot gas at the bondi rate, converts a small fraction of the rest - mass energy into cosmic rays that are accelerated by shocks within some distance @xmath0 of the cluster s center, and uses mixing - length theory to describe convection and its effects on the icm. the model includes thermal conduction and cosmic - ray diffusion ( viscous dissipation ). the mass accretion rate within the central bondi flow is also regulated by feedback from the central agn. we apply this model to a sample of eight moderate - density cooling - core clusters of eight galaxies. for eight of these clusters, measured from their iron abundance profiles, we find that good agreement is found between the model predictions and the observations of the inner regions around the brightest cluster galaxies. the observed amounts of iron in these clusters are consistent with the abundance profiles of the central brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ), for which we derive an estimate of the mean iron yield per supernova ( per free - streaming supernova per century ). in six of the clusters, snia have a significant relative abundance excess, while the remaining four show little or no iron enrichment. the remaining two clusters, however, show a significant amount of iron excess, mainly from snia and stellar winds surrounding the central bcg. we estimate that the remaining iron excesses may originate from the stellar winds of an evolved population thought to have originated from the early in the bcg s history. our results suggest that a moderate degree of convection ( vis - a - vis the turbulent velocity ) is required to account for the iron enrichment in these abundance excesses, and that substantial additional heating due to ` ` supernova feedback '' may be required to explain the cooling - flow component of these abundance profiles. we discuss the possible implications of our results for the variability of the agn power during a cluster s lifetime.
we compare single stellar population spectra of the metal - rich galactic globular cluster 47 tuc to the integrated spectrum of the same system in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ). we use two sets of state - of - the - art theoretical isochrones : one by salaris and collaborators, and the other by salasnich et al. to fit the cmd. we assess the effect of a number of key model inputs, such as the @xmath0 and rgb fluxes, the luminosity function of the upper red giant branch ( rgb ) and the metallicity of the cluster, on the spectroscopic age of the old stellar populations. the calibration of the models is very important : the ratio of the contribution of the turn - off stars to giant stars ( excluded ) provides a good gauge of the impact of the underestimate of the number of bright stars used in the computations. we find that a 1 gyr uncertainty is caused by an error of 75 k in the giant bolometric luminosity, 0.50 in the continuum width of the integrated light of old stars, and 0.1 in the temperature of the atmosphere. thus, a relatively high level of accuracy is required to obtain a good match to the data. the best fit to the cmd is achieved for an isochrone with age 11 - 12 gyrs, and for a lf - corrected model with age 15 - 17 gyrs. such revised ages are in excellent agreement with the ages inferred from fitting both sets of isochrons to the cluster s cmd. in the cmd, balmer lines show too blue by 0.07 mag, while metal - lines are systematically too weak and the integrated _ ( b v ) _ and _ ( cv ) _ emission are very well fit by the lf corrected models. when taking into account the absence of first - ascent giants in the rgb and the agb, the theoretical lfs provide too low of a correction for the lack of metal - line stars in the upper giant branch. however, even after correcting for a systematic mismatch of the rgb in the main sequence, the corrected lf is still unable to account for the 3 gyrs difference between the models and the observations.
we present multi - wavelength optical imaging and photometry for a sample of 19 very luminous infrared galaxies ( vlirgs : @xmath0z@xmath00.07 ). these objects have been selected from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) and, as such, they are a well studied local group. we use the multi - color - magnitude diagram to compare the present sample with previously studied samples of ulirgs. the main conclusions of the present study are the following five main ones. \1 ) in the color - magnitude diagram, the nuclei and the systems have well defined distributions which run along the reddening line, suggesting that part of the observed scatter is due to extinction effects. the average luminosity ( 2.2 - 15.6 jy in rest - frame ) and color ( 1.0 - 0.4 jy ) of the v lirgs is 2.3 magnitudes higher ( 0.6 magnitudes in b, and 0.5 in v ) than that of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) sample. \2 ) the objects in the sample cover a wide range in optical properties ( i.e. luminosity, color, and absolute magnitudes ). the present data are compared with those from previous optical imaging studies of luminous ir galaxies to establish the similarities and differences between the properties of the two groups. \3 ) the present results suggest that the type of galaxies in our sample are cousins to those in the uv bright, high - redshift systems, as has been suggested by a few previous studies. \4 ) for the majority of the objects, the bolometric bolometric luminosities, the intrinsic colors, and the optical to ir colors are consistent with those of the local unobscured population of galaxies. \5 ) the similarity of the morphologies, the frequency of interactions, the fraction of agn in the samples with low luminosity nuclear sources, and, if extrapolated to higher redshifts, the number of galaxies with active nuclei, in young systems, suggests that the evolution of these systems is more dominated by instanteneous starbursts, while the evolution during the late phases is more likely dominated by extended starburst, though some objects may evolve into a qso - like object. \6 ) the distribution of optical to near - ir colors of these objects agrees with previous works which have suggested a correlation of type of nuclear ionization with bolometric ( far infrared )
we present the first results from our _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) cluster survey of the luminous clusters lynx e and lynx w. we obtain a total of 217 galaxies within 2 @xmath0 from these two clusters at z=1.26. of those galaxies, 50 % are ellipticals. the color magnitude relation ( cmr ) for both clusters is tight at redshift around unity, with a slope of m / l@xmath1. the scatter around the cmr, however, increases towards the cluster centers, suggesting that galaxies closer to the cluster center are older elliptical galaxy populations or that there are more interlopers in the cluster outskirts. weak lensing analysis of the images show that both clusters host on going luminous mergers. although the morphology, mass and star formation rates of cluster galaxies at these redshifts are similar to local cluster galaxies, there is a clear evolution in their galaxy distributions, with mean galaxy fractions and axial ratios decreasing with increasing redshift. our analysis shows that the bright red early type galaxy population is already in place in both clusters at reddenings between 1.5 and 2.0. in lynx even, two luminous red merging ( s0 ) galaxies are located on the same cmr as the ellipticals, and they are found to follow the same slope of cmr. the presence of both s0s and ellipticals in the same environment confirms that bright cmr galaxies are formed from hierarchical mergers of less luminous cluster galaxies. if this is a general trend, it will permit us to discuss the evolution of cluster early type galaxies in the redshift range 0.775 - 0.5. we compare our results with other clusters that show more extended clustering or an evolved early type population. we find that the relation between cmr color and mass may not be continuous across the cluster. there are regions where the relation breaks down, such as for rdcs 12522927. these regions might be undergoing a mass assembly as the two clusters merge.
we study the effects of the bulk motion of x - ray flares in the coronae of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) on the line properties of the underlying accretion disk and the reflection line at 6.4 kev. we perform a joint relativistic calculation ( combining both special and general relativity effects ) to investigate the impact of the small - scale ( @xmath0 ) and long - time scale ( ew ) variations of the line profile and equivalent width of the fe line ( which is thought to be produced by the fluorescence of cold disk material and is accompanied by the compton - scattered continuum ) on reflection spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies. in particular, we consider the case of a maximum kerr black hole ( kerr = 1 - 5 m@xmath1 ) and a corona with approximately constant ionization state. we assume that the primary x- ray flare is located above the inner portion of a thin disk, in the region very close to the black hole and are illuminated only by the coronal x - rays. the illumination flux from the flares is then directed into the disk, and the line flux increases with increasing continuum flux. we calculate the time - average and time - varying fe line profiles for different flare locations and different corona geometries using a ray tracing technique and elliptic integrals. the line profiles are found to be broadened and skewed with respect to a point - like flare in the general axisymmetric emissivity law, which is attributed to the doppler ( or boyer - lindquist ) effect. the equivalent width is found to increase with increasing fluorescence intensity and also with increasing line profile shape. we discuss how these effects may be interpreted in the context of current observations. future works using _ bepposax _ and _ ginga _ observations should be able to distinguish between the magnetic outflows near the central objects with neutral or ionized matter and the outflows flowing out from more distant objects.

i have analysed the physical properties of fifteen transiting extrasolar planet ( tep ) using high - precision photometry and the predictions of five different theoretical stellar model sets. i have also explored the effects of residual gaussian noise in the tep light curves. i show that the parameters measured for most teps are severely underestimated by inclusion of the third light in synthetic light curves representative of good ground - based observations. jktebop codes and models are used to approximate the light curves, but they do not provide an accurate description of the variability of the parameters and their uncertainties are discussed. in particular, the limb darkening ( ld ) coefficient, which is widely used in model analyses of transiting systems, is not included as a fitted parameter in these models. instead, the velocity amplitude and the fractional radius of the parent star are measured as a function of the orbital semimajor axis and the ld coefficients. the resulting physical properties are statistically compatible, and any structure in distributions of parameters is maximised. from the light curve analysis of each tep i have obtained the orbital inclination and fractional radii of the two host stars. these are sensitive to the companion star mass and the extent of occultation. from a homogeneous analysis of the spectra of the host stars i find that the companion stars are fainter in the @xmath0 band than indicated by the current photometry. as a guide, 5 % of third light would make it possible to rule out the presence of a very faint star ( for which wasp-2 ) which is known to be a close companion of a tep.

in this article we reexamine the model independent data analysis method for determining the mass of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) from data ( measured recoil energies ) of direct dark matter detection experiments. we take into account a fraction of residue background events, which pass all background discrimination criteria and then mix with other real wimp induced events in the analyzed data sets, and want to determine with high statistical certainty the reconstructed wimp mass from these ` ` ` impure '' data sets how ` ` dirty '' these data sets could be to be. first we review the recoil spectrum of elastic wimp nucleus scattering. then we introduce two kinds of background spectrum for wimp scattering : the _ target dependent _ spectrum and the _ constant _ spectrum. the unique needed information is the recoil energies recorded in _ two _ direct detection experiments with _ two different _ target nuclei. we consider first the measured energy spectrum for different wimp masses with two forms of possible residue background spectrum : the target dependent exponential spectrum which contributes relatively more events to the high energy ranges ( e.g., between 0 and 100 kev for 250 kev ) and the constant background spectrum, which mainly contributes to the low energy ranges in the exponential background spectrum. by using the two different background spectra, and taking into account the fact that the target depend only on the target mass and that the background spectrum of the constant spectrum is relatively _ sharper _ compared to the one of the exponential spectrum for a light wimp ( @xmath0 gev ), as well as the one that exhibits the galactic ` ` c''-like velocity distribution function, we show that the reconstructions of the wimp(s ) can be carried out by a relatively _ sharp _ background spectrum with relatively _ no _ flux in the background, i.e., zero or one percent of the total background spectrum in the entire energy ranges up to the maximal background windows allowed by the experimental data ( energy ranges of wimpless wimp detection experiments ). in contrast, the minimal background spectrum presented in this article does not have such high enough levels of sharpness to make a significant contribution to the background reconstruction in the highest energy ranges, but it is still possible to reconstruct a reasonable approximation ( with relatively low statistical uncertainty ) of the full wimp spectrum from the measured recoil energy data sets.
the existence of heavy stable charged particles of relativistic nature, correlated with nuclear interactions with the radiation field of cosmic plasma, can provide explanation for anomalies in high energy cosmic positrons spectra observed by pamela and by dama / libra experiments. we approach the study of ohe, slowed down in the matter of dama detector, in the framework of @xmath0-inspired dark matter scenario. in this new form of dark matter the ohe can be an effective dark matter particle, which decouples from baryonic matter. it can form a few kev bound state with nucleus, in which ohe atoms play the main dynamical role in the development of gravitational instability, triggering large scale structure formation. in detectors with different chemical content inside the nucleus strong nuclear attraction takes place. the energy of this bound state, proportional to the temperature above the cosmic ray threshold, can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of the standard cold dark matter ( cdms ) model, leading to the existence of significant ohe ionization signal. annual modulation of this signal in the range 2 - 6 kev can be detected by using cryogenic detectors, although such signal is below the current experimental errors. the agreement between theoretical predictions and the analytical results of experiments is discussed in the context of walking technicolor model. * non - homogeneous dark matter with exotic nuclear interactions * + * r. hildebrandt@xmath1, h.j. griehammer@xcite, j.a. khalaidovski@xiuc.ac.cn + * g.i. stefs. zhou * _ lebedev physics institute, moscow 119991, russia _ + * pacs number(s ) : 12.38.bx, 12.39.jh * keywords : * cosmology : theory, dark matter, cosmic rays, diffuse radiation + * msc ( 2010 ) : 95.30.+g, 98.80.-k, 95.80.+e, 97.20.cf + * a&a * abstract * + a composite dark matter of nuclear interactions + with cosmic plasma and nuclei * + h.c. wong _ universidad tcnica federico santa mara + instituto de fomento, av. rovisco pais, p.o. box 513, 1049 - 0013 lisboa, portugal _ + e - mail : h.p.
we investigate non adiabatic quantum phase transitions from a quantum paramagnetic to a quantum ferromagnetic phase in the presence of optimal driving fields and find the optimal control fields. the study is motivated by the fact that the gap between the ground state and first excited state closes as a function of the size at the critical point, in agreement with recent results from numerical simulations. moreover, we show that by optimizing the driving field, the speed up of the evolution can be significantly increased with respect to the non optimized case. we propose a generalized landau - zener - model and compare it with the gsa and lmg models to better understand the physics of the process. the description of quantum many - body systems through the manipulation of an external field has been one of the most prominent areas of research in condensed matter physics for the past two decades @xcite. in this context, analytical and numerical approaches to model the behavior of such systems have been intensively developed during the last two decades _ partly _ in order to understand their properties and to _ in principle _ to predict the outcomes of certain dynamical transformations. changing the parameters of the system may speed up a process that starts with a slowly evolving initial state, evolve towards a rapidly increasing target state and finally reach a non - evolving target state on the contrary side of the gap. this phenomenon, called quantum phase transition ( qpt ), has drawn a lot of attention in the physics community, as it is known that it is impossible to achieve a qualitatively different dynamics on the equal footing with the environment at any finite size. nevertheless, the transition from a microscopic quantum mechanical system to a macroscopic one can be qualitatively understood in the context of a large finite size effective hamiltonian, with the initial state acting as a continuous set of lagrange multipliers. this is precisely what we report in this paper : in a very general sense, a qpt is a process in which a small number of particles move at constant speed along a geodesic in the atmosphere. the set of particles consists of electrons, in which interaction between the electrons plays a fundamental role. this process is rather simple and, as far as we know, has only been studied once, in a physical system. here we explore a possible extension of the schrdinger equation, by assuming that the energy is in the form of a potential, we can study qpts in a quite general way. the idea to exploit the quantum properties of a given system is to characterize the process by means of numerical simulations
we consider the propagation of primordial anisotropies in hot clusters, using a covariant kinetic theory approach to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect. we present analytic formulas for the spectral distortion in the limit of small optical depth, including relativistic effects to second - order. our formalism is independent of scalar, vector or tensor decomposition, and it is suitable for calculations in a flat, cold dark matter universe. we use a version of the covariant perturbation theory developed by ellis and coworkers for electron temperatures @xmath0, and are able to describe the evolution of the density, as well as the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the frame of the plasma. we consider effects due to the plasma rotation, and to the energy exchange between the radiation and the baryon plasma in the fermi acceleration regime. for this purpose, we present equations for scalar - valued, first - order gauge - invariant variables describing the advancement of density inhomogeneities, and the cmb anisutropy for quadratic scalar perturbations in a universe which is approximately a free - streaming model. these equations, along with the kinetic theory equations given in this bulletin, form a complete description of the radiative evolution of a hot cluster. we find that the application of the relativistically extended kompaneets equation, developed previously by fabbri and coworkers, has important consequences for the calculation of the hubble constant by this method. in particular, these effects cause a reduction in the asymptotic constant of the effective temperature, of about a factor of three, and a magnitude decrease in the ratio of the apparent to rest - mass energy of the universe to the experimental energy density. = cmbx12 scaled 1 22v_2 2m_2
in multi - user systems, multiple transmitters / receivers share a common communication medium, and therefore, there is an inherent competition in accessing the channel. information theoretic results for such systems imply that in order to achieve a high spectral efficiency, the users with stronger channel should have a higher portion of the resources. the drawback to this is the loss of the fairness among the users. to provide fairness, we want to find the corner point for which the minimum rate of the active users is maximized ( max - min corner point ). this problem is formulated by considering a point on the face of the contra - polymatroid. a simple greedy algorithm is introduced to find this corner point. based on this algorithm, it is shown that the problem of deriving the time - sharing coefficients and rate - splitting can be decomposed into some lower - dimensional subproblems. _ _ a criterion based on nash bargaining solution in the context of game theory is proposed. this criterion generalizes the proportional fairness and increases the efficiency of the system. as a special case, we consider a multiaccess system in which the distribution of inputs are independent and equal to @xmath0. particularly in some multiuser systems, the boundary of the capacity region includes a facet on which the sum - rate is maximum ( sum - capacity facet ). in such systems, one can benefit from the available degrees of freedom, i.e., determine the fairest rate - vector ( the uniform minimum rate among all users ), and determine the fairness coefficient as well. as the first example, we show that a subset of the convex hull of these corner points forms a polymatoid. in fact, the polymetroid structure is established first by establishing a relationship between the existing capacity region of the simulating multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast channel ( both positive semi - definite diagonal and non - diagonal covariance matrices ), then by determining the best linear combination of these two matrices. the result is proved by proving the optimality of the above algorithm. the optimal dynamic power allocation strategy for time - varying multiple - access channels is also discussed.
the star he 21481247 was selected as a candidate extremely metal - poor star from the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ) using automatic spectral classification. moderate resolution ( @xmath0 ) spectra, taken with the new technology telescope at the european southern observatory, la silla, chile, have shown large enhancements of the heavy neutron capture elements, in particular na and zr. these enhancements are similar to those recently found for several other extremely metal poor stars from the he s, including hd 186478, which is a c - enhanced star. the enhancements of c and n, which are very rare among very metal poorest stars, have been observed in several such stars, and usually not studied in the visual band. an eu abundance analysis has been performed on top of the existing fe abundances to determine the possible origins of the enhancement of these elements, which we find to be significantly larger than the solar value. using the laws of stellar physics to take into account the contributions from the two neutron capture processes, we have derived radial velocities for the unblended, pure atomic lines of ba, la ii, eu ii, and nd ii. the line strength is found to be comparable to that of the stellar continuum at 4500, but much larger than that of any of the emission lines detected in the uv spectrum, indicating that the non - lte broad absorption features are enhanced at the 1.6@xmath1 level in this particular region of the spectrum. an abundance analysis of the complete set of atomic lines has been carried out. we demonstrate that the abundance ratio of pure na to heavy eu is close to solar, while the comparison of the na to zr abundance shows that zr represents the most overabundant element of the solar inventory. we discuss the implications of these results for the nucleosynthesis of elements which were produced in the very early epochs of star formation, and for the efficiency of mass transfer in binary systems. we have also discussed the nature of the extremely heavy elements used to analyze the spectra of very metal poor intermediate mass binaries, and we speculate that they may be due to mixing of convective material in the binary systems during the initial stages of binary evolution.
we present a rapid, data - driven method for the identification of galaxies containing a young ( @xmath01 gyr ) stellar population, but no significant ongoing star formation, in the spectrum of a galaxy. we start from a set of synthetic spectra of stellar populations of ages spanning a range of ages and metallicities, constructed from the single stellar population models of @xcite. the spectra are characterised by strong hydrogen balmer absorption - lines ( hbs ) together with a lack of significant [ oii]3272 emission, implying a recent ( i@xmath00.1 - 0.5 ) starburst, but only little evidence for on - going star formation. we develop a bayesian formalism to solve the inverse modelling problem, as well as to objectively assess to what extent such a hypothesis is supported by the data. we find that the bulk of the stellar content of early - type galaxies can be represented by two components, one which represents contributions from old, metal - rich stellar populations, and the other representing contributions from young populations. the two component model spectra can be accurately fit by a conventional two - component model distribution, with the amount of the ` young'component significantly increasing with age. physical interpretations of the results are robust, in terms of both physical interpretability and the ability for predictive generalisation to previously unseen data of the same type. the bayesian framework employed here allows us to automate several functional requirements within a single statistically sound formalism, where all modelling assumptions may be explicitly encoded. hence, our components analysis is able to rapidly identify post - starburst galaxies, without the uncertainties inherent in the measured equivalent widths of the balmerino absorption and [ oiop emission lines. in contrast, as our method utilises all the information present in the long - baseline spectra, it is a more robust diagnostic of recent star - forming activity. using the wealth of data available in the sdss and the 2dfgrs, with signal - to - noise as good or better than the data we analyse here, we may map precisely in what environments star - formation is suppressed ( e.g. in groups or clusters ).

we report the results of a systematic chemical analysis of the metal - poorest galactic stars. these stars belong to two halo subsystems, an accreted halo and a protodisk halo. the first subsystem was formed by the stars and globular clusters captured by the galaxy at different times from debris of dwarf satellite galaxies disrupted by its tidal forces. secondly the stars of the second subsystem were formed from the matter of a collapsing single protogalactic cloud. it is shown that the pattern of variations of the chemical elements in stars of these two subsystems is almost independent of their azimuthal velocities. in particular, the relative abundances of the elements of respectable ( [ fe / h ] ), i.e., magnesium, calcium, iron and europium, do not change with the altitude of the galactic center. this implies that, at least in the initial stage of its formation, the interstellar matter in the early galaxy either was well mixed or sneii of the same mass exploded in all local volumes. in contrast, the accreteds stars exhibit a large spread in the relative abundance of these elements. this spread may be explained by an extremely low star formation rate in the satellite galaxies where these stars were born. fortunately the next generation of stars is born in a relatively enriched interstellar medium that was generally enriched by several supernovae and mixing partially levels off the dependence on the explosion parameters. hence, the variations in the upper boundary of the initial mass function for stars exploded at different points inside and outside its early galaxy can be traced. concurrently because of the difference between the evolution times of sneii and the thickness of the halo, we can try to trace the star formation rates for this stellar ensemble by the coordinates of the characteristic knee in its [ @xmath0/fe ] diagram. the results obtained here confirm the hypothesis put forward by marsakov and borkova ( 2005 ).
this paper studies topology inference in networks using active measurements and network tomography. our goal is to infer the internal network ( @xmath0-by-@xmath1 ) topology of a multiple - source multiple - destination topology using end - to - end probes. sending probes between sets of sources and receivers, and having the ability to trace subnetwork components ( _ e.g., small components s / n and s / o ) in real networks, is important for many applications, including network topology management, diagnosis, operation, security, and performance optimization. significant progress has been made over the past years on decompositions of topological data ( including loss and delay metrics ) and topologies ( _ i.e., link - level parameters such as number, order, or a monotonic property of received probes ). however, existing approaches for inferring topologies rely on either sending probes or sending probes to a single receiver, neither of which are efficient in terms of computational resources. in this paper, we formulate the problem in the framework of active learning, characterize its complexity, and design an efficient algorithm to solve it. one of our contributions is to provide _ active learning algorithms _ that can probe / query the network and then reconstruct it in a practical way. we show that in this way, the problem can be split into a collection of _ passive _ and _ active _ queries, where the active queries are sent to the receiver without interference from intermediate nodes. in the passive approaches, the number of queries is determined by the correlation structure of the received probes, and the response of the passive algorithm is evaluated via simulation. the active learning algorithm is compared to a previous one based on the _ multiple - hypothesis testing _ ( gbs ) framework, which has been shown to provide a more efficient and accurate solution to the same problem. the comparison shows that the greedy algorithm based on gbs is the most accurate one, and provides a lower bound on the complexity of the problem.
the oft - quoted conjecture that the universe is flat is not falsifiable. as we will show, even in a universe which is absolutely and truly empty, if the density of the universe at the present epoch of inflation is very close to the critical value, then inflation can not get any flatness higher than about @xmath0 second. in other words one has to expect inflation to occur at a higher redshift. the flatness problem is a manifestation of the fact that when viewed from any vantage point the universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic, and hence inflation is a genuine solution to the problem of object horizon. the conventional wisdom that when observed on still larger scales the universe must be infinitely flat is naive, and therefore not true. if we trust the cosmological principle and trust the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy for the whole universe at all times, then of course in universes which are not empty even at the highest redshifts, no matter how far we see the universe, the universe will always be flat. but even in the case of almost empty universes, if we use the robertson - walker metric to place all our fundamental observers in it, all we get is a finite horizon, and thus we do not come across any phase of inhomogeneity or anisotropy in the universe. this in turn lends itself to the question of why the universe could have been so flat in the past. the object horizon problem is actually much nearer to us than we think, and we as observers are actually nearer to the horizon than we were a few decades ago, hence we have not yet had time to interact with each other before inflation. thus without casting any whatsoever doubts on the inflationary theories, we merely point out that one can not use these type of arguments to support inflation, unless they are willing to accept a finite amount of time as a priori. it is only by coincidence that we find that in those scenarios, which are more like the big bang scenarios, the distant universe would appear to be either flat or so.
we discuss the influence of stellar winds from massive stars on chemical evolution of forming giant molecular clouds ( gcs ) within dark matter halos at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ). we have performed a set of chemodynamical simulations with grape sph codes for gc formation. we confirm that stellar winds deplete the gas of gc - forming gmcs and produce an abundance inhomogeneity among light elements ( e.g., c, n, o, and fe ). the chemical composition of gcs in our models is different from that of the galactic gcs. the fraction of n - rich stars in gcs is found to be as high as 0.4 of the gc population. the n abundances of forming gcs within the galaxies are also different from the galactic ones. we find that models with top - heavy initial mass functions ( isothermal radial density profiles ) can account for the observed bimodal distribution in [ n / fe ], except for the cases when the second generation of stars is contributing most of the gas in the detectors. models with the lowest initial mass function ( ` ` canonical '' imf ) can not reproduce the observed yn abundance in some gcs, although a large fraction of stars still need to be formed in order to explain the ngc 6752 spread. the present results imply that ` ` self - pollution '' of g c - forming mcs by stellar winds of massive stars can be significant for the formation of the observed population of stars ( both field and field stars ). although most gcs are formed within a single large gmc, not all gcs can be formed from a single high - density gmc. we suggest that the ` ` second generation '' of stars should start with a number of low - mass ( 2@xmath1 ) star clusters ( scs ) and then transition to the more massive stars with the mass of the host gc. subsequently, the remnants of these star clusters can be dispersed via galactic supernova and stellar winds.
we examine the clustering of galaxies predicted by two leading theoretical methods for studying galaxy formation and bias in a cosmological context : semi - analytic models and hydrodynamic numerical simulations. we focus on galaxy samples with thresholds in baryon mass and stellar population age, which are roughly analogous to observational samples defined by cuts in luminosity and color. using a @xmath0-model, in which each halo contains one central galaxy moving at the halo s center - of - mass velocity, we compare the properties of central and satellite galaxies in the two methods. to minimize biases arising from the assumption that all galaxies are similar, we assume that the baryons in a given dark matter halo do not contribute significantly to the total halo mass. when we allow the predictions of both models to take into account the physical factors that shape the hod, we find that the spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies within halos are very similar : in a sph model, the distance of a central galaxy from the center of a dark halo is no more than a factor of 2.5 for galaxies of a given virial mass, and the velocity distribution of ` ` satellite '' galaxies is significantly more concentrated towards the center than that of the central galaxy. in a model with a lower limit on the scale of the dark matter density, the relative spatial distribution of galaxies and dark matter is more extended : satellites have spatial distributions similar to the central galaxies, but velocity distributions are more concentrated toward the center, and there is no significant difference between the distribution of satellite galaxies and the central distribution. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic examination of the ` ` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) for a class of galaxies, and it provides strong constraints on the interplay between galaxy clustering and the underlying dark matter distribution. our results should provide useful input to theoretical models of galaxy formation, enabling them to be used to interpret observations and to resolve conflicts between models and observations.
we have extended our theory of extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs from 0.3 to 15 and investigated the effects of clouds, in particular h@xmath0o, on the spectra of objects below and around them. a comprehensive suite of new models, the non gray theory, has been developed for this class of objects, that include evolution equations of state for metallic hydrogen / helium mixtures, chemical equilibrium codes and thermodynamic data to determine molecular fractions, scattering and absorption opacities for the dominant chemical species, an atmosphere code to calculate temperature / pressure profiles and to identify the radiative and convective zones, and a radiative transfer code to provide emergent spectra. in principle, the calculation of the atmosphere and the computation of the emergent spectrum are done together. however, as long as the thermodynamic profiles obtained with the atmosphere code are accurate, one can employ another more accurate and higher resolution transfer scheme, for example, the k coefficient method, to calculate infrared magnitudes and colors. in this paper we present color color diagrams for objects in the field and in clusters and discuss the evolution of the family of substellar objects. the suite of models that we use, the jupiter mass range ( 0.003 @xmath1 0.001 ) and the m dwarf / brown dwarf / egp model continuum, are used to characterize the properties of the entire family of objects and to describe the transition to stars. we have applied the color - color diagrams to things like gl229b, but otherwise the models cover the same temperature and metallicity range. the color fits are found to be in good agreement with the empirical blackbody values for egps and to be less accurate for m dwarfs than they are for eclipsing stars. there is good agreement between the model colors for stars near the edge of the main sequence and the observational estimates. for close companions, however, advances in adaptive optics, interferometry, and coronagraphs will be necessary to disentangle the light of companion and nematic companions and to separate the presence and temperature of stars below and above the stellar surface. the concept of clouds introduced by kolmogorov smirnov in the early days of atomic and molecular physics is shown to be essential to the characterization of clouds and to the understanding of the substellar phenomenon in general. we find that most clouds are capable of providing accurate temperature and pressure profiles, but that the opacity of clouds complicates the derivation of the condensation energy of many objects. nevertheless,
we have investigated the redshift evolution of 539, @xmath0 0.10.7 early - type galaxies using multiwavelength observations from the combo-17 and gems surveys. the sample was originally selected to be redshifted from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) optical bandpass to the _ great observatories origins deep survey _ ( goods ) bandpass. using stacking analyses, we identified 32 candidates of agn based on their radio, optical, and radio properties. the majority ( 29 out of 32 ) of these galaxies were not detected individually in the deep observations. however, the other 17 sources were detected in at least one of three bands ( and probably in all three bands ), providing evidence that these are heavily contaminated by hot interstellar gas and/or large - scale molecular clouds ( lmxbs ). the evolution of the average luminosity - weighted mean optical luminosity ratio,, steeply decreases with redshift out to. the inferred ratio is roughly constant compared to the optically luminous galaxy samples, which shows a shallower slope and a brighter tail at higher redshifts. from the best - fit linear relation between and the mean absolute magnitude and the effective temperature of the hot -emitting gas, we find that the average ( uncorrected for absorption and emission ) luminosity of the lmxb component scales linearly with the host galaxy luminosity, as expected from the passive fading of old stellar populations. the weak dependence of the on - going agn activity on redshift also suggests that the present - day luminosity function is largely controlled by feedback from transient active galactic nuclei ( agns ), which is consistent with observations of distant, low - redshift galaxies. using the properties of the majority of the agn candidates, we were able to classify and place constraints on the x - ray luminosity evolution of agns and normal, optically faint galaxies. the median redshift of the faded sample is 0.34 gyr, while the average agn fraction stays roughly constant over that redshift range. using measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) emission, we found that the integrated ( or luminosity ) emission of the cmb in low - luminosity ( or -like sources ) galaxies increases significantly with cosmic time, suggesting that the main source of emission from these galaxies is likely to be the stellar mass of an as yet undisturbed fraction of stars.
we present a proposal for the realization of a quantum annealer with ultracold rydberg atoms in optical lattices. using a combination of an ancilla qubit in the middle of each square lattice of rubidium and cesium atoms arranged on three plaquettes we demonstrate a coherent control of the many - body adiabatic passage of a few - body quantum matrix with the help of a coherent driving field. for a system size of several rubidium atoms the required single - particle coherence time is significantly shorter than the typical laser detunings of individual atoms. we demonstrate that coherent operation of such an experimentally possible quantum system can be achieved with optimal ryderg dressing of the atoms. the large and controllable lifetime of the annealing sweep combined with programmable infinite - range interactions make this an attractive alternative to the current paradigm of quantum enhanced thermal cooling. we discuss the feasibility of realizing the proposed system numerically and show that it has the potential to provide a significant increase in the quantum information processing power of contemporary quantum computing. the success probability of the proposed scheme is shown to be significantly smaller than that of current schemes due to the much smaller required decoherence rates. we anticipate that this scheme will find numerous applications in the field of strongly correlated quantum information. the class of systems known as spin systems @xcite has been the focus of an intensive research effort in the last years. this has been motivated by the prospect of realizing an all - optical quantum computer, where the need for a compact, ultra - cold environment to explore the quantum mechanical behavior of a wide range of systems is addressed. one possible solution to the problem of quantum coherence has been to realize a ground state encoded in atomic ensembles consisting of a small number of spins. this approach has the advantage that the effects of quantum correlations on the ground state dynamics are strongly suppressed compared to present day methods of implementing a quantum computer. the resulting device could potentially be implemented with current experimental technology, such as high - accuracy optical spectroscopy or high - precision spectrometers. in the near future, complementary architectures for quantum computing based on spin systems such as quantum memories will be feasible thanks to the availability of modern day technology. in particular, large solid state platforms such as freestanding quantum simulators and spin - glass condensates will enable experiments with a large number of qubits on a single lattice. the interplay of light and matter interactions will allow to study the coherence and entanglement of
it has been suggested that in nuclei, the partons are bosons. this implies a huge violation of the callan - gross relation, a fact which is relevant to nuclear deep inelastic scattering and the related drell - yan process. we present a detailed discussion of light front nuclear theory with underlying symmetries. we show that in the bjorken model, the scattering of photons with different polarizations produces a large plus - momentum transfer for the valence quark in the nucleus. this transfer is small compared to the mean field energy, @xmath0, of free nucleons, but is large enough to cause a significant enhancement in the cross section for _ t+_l +. we evaluate the nuclear effects on this process using a simple, four - dimensional expression for the energy without a square root operator. the results are that > 1,<1,there are the possibility of observing this enhancement @xcite. the purpose of this talk is twofold. first, we want to get a better understanding of the extent to which vector and scalar mesons are essential to the light front dynamics of nuclei. we have developed a model, based on the shell model equal time action, for calculating the cross sections for vector and vector - scalar nuclear interactions. second, we also want to understand the effects of correlations between two nucleons. we investigate a method in which the structure function of a virtual photon of four momentum can be inverted so that it passes through the nucleon s center of mass. in that process the transverse part of the photon is converted into a scalar nucleus, and this has been termed as a severe ` ` crisis '' for nuclear theory. to evaluate the effect of this transverse conversion, one needs to know the ratio of the two transverse plus longitudinal polarization cross sections. this ratio is known as the basis of the hermes effect@xcite and originates from the weinberg equation. it has been proposed as a signature of the nucleons being fermion ( quarks ), and realized experimentally in lepton - nucleus scattering by drell yan for the 28.5 gev lepton nucleus experiment. we shall review experimental evidence for this type of effect, as well as the calculations of the dependence on the photon polarization.
we present optical spectroscopic identifications of x - ray sources in a @xmath03 square degree field of the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey. this is intermediate between shallower surveys like the 2df or sdss like the vimos vlt deep survey ( le fvre et al. 2004 ) and deeper but spatially restricted surveys such as the vvds or the cosmos field reaching a magnitude limit of i@xmath1 magnitude of 27.5. in our field we detect 93 sources, of which 17 are spectroscopically identified. among the 17 non - identified sources, 10 have radio counterparts. we further look for possible emission based on the shape of the ca h&k break at 4000. we find evidence of non - thermal emission in our spectra for 10 sources, while for the remaining 5 we have only radio counterparts with non - zero emission. for a total of 800 sources, we obtain a 90 % confidence level upper limit on the flux of disk stars at 2 kev with a location in the sky consistent with their being powered by active galactic nuclei ( agn ). however, of the 320 broad - line agns detected, only 0 % of them have a radio counterpart with a detectable signal of agn activity. this suggests that most of these xmm sources are at the low luminosity tail of the agn sequence. on the other hand, there is one case of a xbong being associated with a bl lac object and we investigate the possibility of them becoming bl lacs. finally, we remark that there is a trend between the position of the bl lac in the ir - color - color diagram and its absolute magnitude. this may be an indication of the presence of a relatively compact bl lac.

we give the following results on fractional integration by parts for generalized fractional integrals. we prove parts ( b ) and ( c ) of the integral in the case of hadamard - type fractional differential systems. here we mean by a ` ` ` sufficiently good '' function @xmath0 ` ` essentially '' different from the katugampola integral, but related to a fractional equation. the proof is the same as that on part ( a ). we also give results on composition ( index ) of fractional integral operators and on the corresponding fractional product - integration formulae. this completes the proof of the theorem [ eq : th1 ]. the purpose of this article is to show that for a given ( _ fractional _ ) integral equation, if we take into account the essential supremum ( *??? * eq. ), we have algebraically closed system. in this setting we have the following boundedness conditions to be satisfied for the yield of a yield of algebraic closed systems. \0. introduction we consider an integral equation in the above mentioned system. given a symmetric partial differential equation, we wish to solve for the conjugate of the partial differential equations the following problem. given the semi - algebraic structure of the system, it is desirable to have a solution in fractional calculus. for this purpose we shall consider the following non - abelian equation : given a non - vanishing value of the equation asymptotic freedom, we shall ask for the solutions in the following questions : what is the maximal number of possible solutions? when one fixes the number of solutions and is interested in the ` ` optimal set of solutions '', in other words.\0. we shall see that the answer is well - defined by themma @xcite. the key words in the first section are : integral equations, fractional analysis, part ( ab ), trujillo integral, melling transform, integral by parts, part ii, trupke - kober type evaluation, part iii, part iv, part v, part vi, part xiv viii vii vii zr, zvi zr viii zr zvii zviii zvi * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 60k37 ; 60j40 ; 60k35 ; 60b20 ; 60g40 ; 82b45
in _ in vitro _ experiments have shown that a small concentration of tau on the microtubule ( mts ) can exert a strong force on the directionality of intracellular transport in the axon. this force has a strong impact on the overall transport properties of the cell. some of the notable features of this work are : 1 ) the description of the spatio - temporal evolution of the mts when transected ; 2 ) the hint of the self - organization of the network and the way in which new mts are transported ; 3 ) the form of the growing ends of mts and the orientation of their branches ; 4 ) the role of steric interactions in mt network dynamics. the analysis of experiments and simulations is challenging due to the enormous complexity of the problem. we are able to make progress in understanding transport in normal axons by means of stochastic models, following the approach outlined in the first chapter. in the second chapter we review illustrative examples relevant for axons. the problem that we address here is the modelling of the transport of molecular motors in the mt network. there are two main problems that are particularly timely. firstly, we describe how the mechanism of transport can be improved by including some mechanical forces. the magnetic field of a tau - like molecule may play a role in axonal transport. secondly, we propose mechanisms to reduce the stress of the tau binding state and thus reduce the cost of electroexcitation. the axis of our discussion is oriented towards the experimental data, while the position of the plus - ends of the axonal mts is found to be strongly affected by katanin, dynein and other molecular motors. further, we apply the concepts from fluctuation - dissociation theory to understand transport in cells. we show that the concept of collective transport, developed in the context of kinesin-@xcite, has potential for the understanding of a wide variety of neuronal diseases. in particular, we discuss how the mechanisms of transport in mammals can be generalized to other cell types, for example to understand the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. to conclude, we give an overview of the main conceptual issues and open questions that remain to be addressed.
we present panoramic _ spitzer_/mips mid - infrared observations of 165 70@xmath0 m - detected spectroscopic members of the shapley supercluster core ( ssc ) at @xmath1, the most massive and dynamically active structure in the local universe. we identify a significant population of 23 galaxies with infrared colours much redder than can be reproduced by any of the standard infrared sed models, providing evidence that these galaxies are the high - redshift analogues of the dusty starburst and post - starburst galaxies seen in local clusters. many of these galaxies have emission centroid ratios coincident with that of the cluster cores, placing them in the transition zone between star - forming galaxies and quenching the star formation within a cluster. the concentration of these systems around the cores of the five clusters that make up the ssc suggests that these have resided within the icm for some time, rather than being observed on their first infall. given their high redshifts, they are likely to be the cluster s0s in the process of having their star formation quenched. in addition, we find that their optical spectra and lack of significant ultraviolet emission imply little or no ongoing star formation, suggesting that for these galaxies the 70micron emission is produced by evolved stars rather than by ram - pressure stripping. we also present joint analyses of the morphologies and morphologies of the galaxies in this sample. among the cluster members with morphological classifications, only 26 sa and 2 sb have morphologies typical of spirals ( e / s0 ). the joint analysis of the panchromatic spectral energy distributions of the two sub - populations reveals that the two populations have very different origins, with the former being evidence of dust - rich, dust - free galaxies and the latter showing evidence of unresolved star formation. at a given stellar mass, they also appear to be able to quench star formation at a significantly lower rate than the recently observed population of virgo cluster supernovae. these findings suggest that a primary evolutionary pathway for the formation of cluster superclusters involves the pre - processing of cluster gas and dust, before a subsequent transformation of the galaxy into a s0 galaxy, possibly via gas stripping in the dense intracluster medium ( icm ).

we present a theoretical analysis of the effect induced by a vibrational mode on the conductivity through a molecular wire. the considered system consists of a three - modular molecular junction encompassing a left, right and central component of the vibronic system. the conductance of the junction depends on the conformation of the molecule itself : by increasing the system temperature the gate voltage is found to be enhanced. we develop a systematic approach to identify the regime yielding the largest enhancement. furthermore we discuss possible connections with existing quantum descriptions of biological processes, such as energy harvesting in photo - systemic molecular complex and olfaction in molecular electronics. the possibility of a profound change of the nature of matter being driven by a fundamental frequency - dependent change in the molecular conformation has been a subject of intense interest in the last years @xcite. in particular, the field of molecular electronics has recently witnessed a strong development of the potential for a fundamental quantum change, i.e., the transfer of a molecule from one central component to a different location in the wire. this has been made possible due to the fact that the typical energy scales of molecules are no larger than a few @xmath0, and thus the size of quantum fluctuations can be very large. such quantum fluctuations have been exploited for the purposes of quantum information processing, for instance, generating gate voltages that are larger than the typical values for the physical systems in the real world. in recent years, another promising route for a quantum manipulation of molecular systems has been the route of entanglement. this route involves the exchange of molecules between different parts of the wire, which in turn reciprocates with the inter - site hopping. this way, a quantum gate is created at the wire s surface, which reciprocates in the same way with the other molecular gates. this robustness of electronic contacts to quantum fluctuations has been demonstrated, in particular by the measurement of quantum tunneling of molecules in the band structure of optical lattices @xcit. another route for quantum manipulations is the control of external fields, e.g., of laser beams, light beams, etc. a third route is the modulation of the molecular response, which can be considered as a coupling to electronic devices. in order to derive the full picture of the system, it is necessary to develop a mathematical model describing the dynamics of each component. this is the purpose of this paper. we will focus on vibrational modes, which are intrinsic in vibrational waveguides, and will be represented by the harmonic oscillator in between the two
we examine flux resolved spectroscopy of large amplitude, quasi - periodic oscillations in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091@xmath03624 to investigate whether the spectrum during the peak and the dip intervals of the x - ray intensity variations can be described by a single component model. we find that while the difference spectrum from the source is simple and can be fitted by a disc blackbody plus a power law component, the spectral behaviour during the soft dips and the peak itself is much more complex and multi - component. a slim disc approximation with an additional non - thermal component, like the one suggested by previous works, is unable to describe it. by assuming that the variability is due to an unstable radiation pressure dominated disc, and taking into account that the spectral modelling during peak intervals prefers slim disc approximations rather than standard disc prescriptions, we show that the ratio of total luminosity to the disc effective temperature changes as @xmath1 as a function of the bolometric eddington ratio and the rise / fall in luminosity due to difference spectrum can be explained by spectral appearance and disappearance of a spectral component. this requires either the presence of a low temperature comptonized outer cloud or a disc corona, both of which are present in micro - quasars which show prolific and complex oscillations. if the disc is unstable, and the oscillations are caused by radiation pressure - dominated spectra, the parameters of difference spectra can be derived from the _ rxte_/pca data. our results are consistent with the idea that the low temperature, sunyaev - blackbody dominated disc is the most stable component. in the long term, the disc will be seen as the background spectrum which is coupled to the persistent flux level and oscillations will be observed as the disc component. hence both methods of fitting the spectral data will be useful in future theoretical investigations if further modified to the standard disc prescription.

the mechanism of contact formation ( cyclization ) between the ends of polymer chains is an intensely studied topic in the context of single molecule experiments in which the properties of a biomolecule ( rna ) are inferred by attaching linkers with varying polymer characteristics. the experimental reports on rate of cyclization in dna suggest a strong dependence of the rate of loop formation on the polymer length @xmath0. we use an analytic theory, based on the wilemski - and - fixman ( wf ) approximation, for describing the dynamics of the endpoints of rouse chains that includes conformational interactions and interactions between the monomers. in contrast to the sss theory, our theory accurately describes the equilibrium and equilibrium parts of the chain dynamics. in particular, we show that the rouse chain equilibrium exponents are only weakly dependent on the solvent quality, while the diffusion coefficient, which is derived from the equilibrium distance distribution, is very well described by a diffusion equation on the time scale of the diffusion constant evaluated on the order of the kuhn length. the relaxation time associated with the end - to - end distance is tightly coupled to the polymer relaxation time, and we obtain a scaling estimate for this time - dependent diffusion coefficient. the effective potential that describes the interaction dynamics between two monomers in a self - avoiding walk is a very simple one - dimensional potential that is generalized to the case of interacting polymers. the mean time for a monomer to make a contact is given by the solution of an sss equation that describes contact formation in terms of the dna conformational dynamics. the resulting expression for the closed loop length, called looping time, is in good agreement with the polymer chain surface states for all values of the relaxation polymer length, provided an effective diffusion constant that accounts for the chain relaxation dynamics is used. the use of the wf formalism, which was obtained some time ago, may be appropriate for polymers or polypeptide chains near relevant experimental velocities. however, we find that the scaling of loop closure time with the diffusion exponent obtained in the present work, deviates significantly from the ssss prediction for small @xiffn polymers, particularly in the limit of poor solvents. a simple argument shows that this deviation can be explained by the broadening of the distribution of the des cloizeaux correlation hole exponent, i.e., by a distribution that depends on the quality of the solvent. = 1
we present ovro millimeter observations of the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) at a spatial resolution of 5.1 @xmath0 2.7, a factor of 2 - 3 gain in spatial resolution over previous studies. with this enhanced resolution, we resolve substantial core structure within the cnd. we find a total of 26 cnd cores, all of which have diameters less than 0.3 pcs and masses greater than 10@xmath1. based on their densities, we suggest that these cores could form a stellar cluster with high star formation efficiency and migrate to the galactic center within 2 - 7 myr. we also find a strong linear filament in the northern emission lobes, which runs from the northeast, through the northern gap, and continues along the southern arm. a more complex flow of ionized gas is seen along this filament, which is most prominent in the northeastern and southwestern lobes and is most likely excited by uv photons from the central cluster. several molecular and atomic tracers were constructed and used to determine their abundance / flux ratios. the ratios are consistent with zero and have the same value in the entire cnd, suggesting no significant evolution of these tracers with distance from the sun. in addition, the linear filament shows a strong velocity gradient, with the strongest emission coinciding with the northeastern cores. this suggests that the northeastern extension and the northern arm are part of a single, highly collimated feature, both in position and in emission. we confirm that there is substantial variation in the ratio of the ionized - to - non - ionized flux density / flux, with respect to the total cnd emission. this variation is consistent with the ionization enhanced cosmic rays ionized by the uv / nfw interaction, and is not likely the result of variations in the local molecular gas density or temperature. overall, our observations suggest that a substantial amount of molecular gas is being exposed to the strong gravitational field from the center of the galaxy. this gas is potentially clumped and may be unstable to tidal disruption.
in this paper, we describe the general characteristics of a new method of bayesian data analysis for astronomical photometry. the method is based on the use of the posterior probability density distribution ( pdf ) as the prior information for a set of configuration parameters which affect the signal - to - noise ratio of a measurement. in comparison with other methodologies, such as anova, it shows robustness against outliers when outliers are present in the measured data. it also allow to greatly improve the results of inference in the measurement context. the main characteristics of our method are the following four points : + ( a ) we investigate the stability of our classification scheme in the context of measurement data analysi ( i.e., photometric cross - matching of multiwavelength astronomical sources ). let us imagine that we have performed colour measurement in a multi - wavelength survey with ten different instruments, each one under a specific configuration. we present parameter bayesian inference which allows to recover the known information associated to the model coming from the data, in a meaningful way. this information can then be used to design the measurement strategy in such a way that future measurements will benefit from this information. + ( b ) we provide a detailed description of the relevant sources of measurement error, which can be identified as a function of the detector parameters. in particular, we present the definition of a ` ` noise source '' which we refer to as the ` ` clocking noise '' and we discuss how to deal with it. in a further application, we consider a situation where we have two detector models, one with a general set of configurable parameters and the other with a specific set of parameters. we show that a simple bayesian analysis can yield an order of magnitude improvement in the parameter estimation, through the incorporation of relevant prior information. this is exactly what we intend to do through the implementation of our proposed method for the configuration parameters problem. + * keywords : * astronomical detection, model estimation, bayesian statistical inference
we estimate the probability of finding a electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational waves ( gw ) events associated with coalescing supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) detected by the _ laser interferometric space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) as part of the dark matter cosmology project. we focus on quasars as plausible electromagnetic counterparts to smbh merger events, since bright quasar activity is a plausible source of gws, and we show that the detectability of such counterparts will be significantly enhanced by a significant improvement over previous studies. within the 3d error volume, the typical gw signal - to - noise ratio will be less than 1 gw event per detector frequency, for total masses and redshifts of @xmath0 and estimated cosmological parameters. we therefore explore the possibility of identifying a unique electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart to a smbh coalescence event based on the quasar luminosity and peculiar velocity. for a reasonable set of parameters, including the mass of the smbh - black hole merger event, the degree of confidence in the determination of the em counterpart is found to be significantly higher than that in the case of an ` ` ` all standard'sirens '', and comparable to or even lower than the most sensitive all - sky counterpart candidates. the unique counterpart can thus be identified solely from the change in the overall angular position of the merger event. we estimate the number of ways in which such an em counterpart could be found, and in particular explore the three dimensional spatial localization of the event within the error volume. we find that the most promising method for finding such a counterpart would be to search for the source located at the same redshift and luminosity of an em - associated quasar quasar. as an example, we derive predictions for the peculiar velocity of ( quasar ) galaxies within dark matter haloes based on current estimates of the eddington ratio for the density of quasar hosts. the predictions are in good agreement with the observed peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies. we discuss the implications of such a method for studies of the evolution of the black hole / quasar population and of the role of gas as a catalyst in smbh mergers.
the search for the sm higgs @xmath0 will be extended by a further 2 fb@xmath1 of data at lep2. this is expected to be an extremely rich event generator for the tevatron, providing a substantial increase in the reach in parameter space of the higgs signal. the coverage of all higgs masses between 150 gev and 400 gev will be possible, through a combination of dedicated searches, and complementary channels where one or more leptons, together with jets, may be searched. with 150 luminosities per event, and corresponding event generators, it is expected that the signal will be robustly and substantially enhanced. # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

we extend the model - independent probabilistic description logics ( dl - lite ) framework with concrete domains to handle uncertainty and vagueness in the context of first - order logic ( fol ). as a novel approach, we employ markov logic networks ( mlns ) whose formulas are function - free clauses. we formulate the problem as an integer linear program ( ilp ) to compute a maximum a - posteriori ( map ) state of an mln. the main focus of this work is to extend @xmath0 concepts and roles to concrete domains in order to find the most probable coherent ontology based on the annotation of axioms. we consider only numerical concrete domains and leave out the others for future work. in this study, the concrete domain is also used to extend the scheme used in the previous work, namely, the abstract domain ( tbox ). in the first part of the paper, we consider _ concrete domain _ ( also known as _ datatype _ ) and _ abstract object _ ( abstract object ), and investigate the axiom / axiom semantics for both, conceptual and behavioral, knowledge bases. the semantics for the tbox is based on generalization of the bernoulli axiom and the fact that a concrete domain can be used as a construction ( by construction ) of a weighted knowledge base ( or perturbation ). a weighted ( conceptual ) knowledge base can be seen as a set of constraints on the set of possible interpretations of an arbitrary data set. reasoning over this data either involves new knowledge or verifications of correctness. thus, probabilistically extending the model to this kind of knowledge base is a challenge. there exist several studies that employ mlns to extend various dls without concrete domains. some of these studies consider only nominals and instances. in general, the extension is usually expressed in terms of _ concepts _ and _ roles _ ( by concept, role, or atomic concept ). we show that the transformation of tbox and abox completion rules, axicoms, and assertions into fol is not essential for our study. we also provide a novel way to determine whether or not a given given predicate is true or false in the current iteration of the ilp. in particular, we prove that satisfiability checking and union of conjunctive query answering in mln can be done in logspace within the data complexity. therefore, our extension to fol does not affect the complexity of searching the highest - level structure of the dl. _ _
we propose a mechanism to realize various kinds of susy vacua via manipulating the background of local two - cycles through what has been called type iia seiberg - witten brane picture. this is achieved by deforming one given m - theory curve in order to incorporate quantum effects. it is thus of interest to compare this observation with field theory results found in @xcite. additionally, we find that the above partial susy breaking process can be described by deformed one given curve by adding higher @xmath0 terms. epsf.tex # 1#2#3nucl. phys. b * 644 * 3 ( 2002 ) [ arxiv : hep - th/0206255 ] r.a. smith and m. smith, ` ` supersymmetric vacua on intersecting branes, '' _ phys. rev. _ * 106 *, 040401 ( 2005 ) * 99 j.p. partouche and b.t. poon, _ coulomb interaction _ ( university of california, santa barbara, ca 93106 ). b.b. uren, a.j. munday, e.s. kutasov, and d.m. shigemori ` ` kurucz formalism for the nucleon - nucleon interaction in a two - loop potential '' * 127 *, 2209 ( 2000 ) * t.f. krausz, m. dijkgraaf, and c. vafa ` ` the geometric realization of a large - scale supersymmetry - breaking vacuum via d4- and 4-crossings of ns5-branes '' * 129 *, 21793 ( 2001 ) * a.i. takahashi, t.k. itoyama, h.h. ichikawa, and s. yamada + _ department of physics, tohoku university, sendai 980 - 8578, japan _ 1.0 cm [ cols= " >, < ", ] in fig.

we examine the binary mass - transfer hypothesis for blue stragglers ( bss ). during mass transfer in a close binary, the accreting matter may be originally in the convective core of the primary. it is rich in helium relative to the gainer s surface and has a higher mean molecular weight than the surface layers. thermohaline mixing will occur in this case. we assume that the accretor is still on the main sequence at the onset of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ). convective overshooting has little effect in the mass range(1.01.6@xmath1 ) we considered. with the improvement of observational means, more and more bss are detected to have variations in radial velocity. the contact binaries are considered here for there are many uncertainties during contact phase. merger models will be studied in another paper. 0.1 cm _ key words _ : binaries : close stars : evolution stars : mass transfer stars : individual : f190, f131, f190-type merger. + _ pacs _ : 04.65.+x, 95.36.+b, 98.80.-k + _ title of program _ _ catalogue identifier _ _ program obtainable from _ : cpc program library, queen s university of belfast, n. ireland _ _ computers _ _ any computer with a fortran 77 compiler, c compiler etc. _ operating systems under which the program has been tested _ _ programming language used _ _ memory required to execute with typical data _ _ no. of bits in a word _ _ distribution format _ _ _ nature of physical problem _ _ the primary is responsible for transferring matter from the surface of the secondary to the interior of the binary. the secondary transfers this matter in a time variable way. at first sight, the process seems to be simple. however, upon closer inspection, it becomes more difficult to identify the details of the process. multiple scattering, multiple scattering etc. are factors which must be taken into account in the calculation of the velocity of the intermediate - mass binary.
we investigate the _ minimum distance _ of quasi cyclic ( qc ) codes based on circulant permutation matrices ( cpm s ) for use in low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes. we derive a general formula for calculating expected values of short simple cycles in tanner graph of a regular code given its length, degree distribution, and girth. using this formula, we construct a new type of cpm - qc - llpc codes with girth at least 6. our first result is the existence of _ inevitable _ short cycles of lengths @xmath0, which are included in ( at least ) all tanner graphs of our primary constructed code. we consider one of the main reasons why this type of codes is desirable. under the _ additive _ group rule ( i.e., if every element of a block of the block is additive with respect to the group of the same weight, then the lower ber curve of the code is the lowest possible one as far as the bit error - rate ( ber ) is concerned. in our second result, we introduce a new flexible design of such codes where the number of simple cycles can be gradually increased and the girth can be increased. by gradually auguring the base matrix of the codes, it is shown that with the programmable algorithm of our software ( awt - compurity algorithm ) it is possible to reach a lower ber ( down to at least 30 % level for the short to moderate length qc codes without observing error floor in any of their nearest - neighbor codes. our software simulations reveal that such codes with high number of finite simple cycles always perform better than their _ standard _ counterparts, even under optimal _ belief propagation _ ( bp ) decoding algorithms. in fact, under such optimal decoding algorithms, these codes still outperform almost all of their counterpart codes in waterfall region. another advantage of designing such codes is lowering the encoding and decoding complexity. finally, using our new results on multiple - edge protograph codes, we show that if the size of the protograph code is of the order of the largest number of its cuts, then its minimum distance from the _ shannon limits _, which is approximately at the shannon limit, then, the best minimum distance achievable by any code of its kind would be the shortest possible one.
we have used the karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) at 1.5 and 6.0 ghz to map the disk and halo of the nearby lyon group galaxy, ugc 10288. this is the third paper in the series, ` ` continuum halos in nearby galaxies an evla survey ( chang - es ) ` ( the chandra imaging survey and the national radio astronomy observatory wide - band survey ), with the goal of studying the properties of radio continuum emission from this galaxy and its background sources. we achieve a total rms of 3 @xmath0jy beam@xmath2 for a single array / frequency band combination ( c - array, c - band ), providing a range of spatial resolution from 3.0 arcsec to 37 arcsec. one remarkable result of these observations is the detection of a double - lobed extragalactic radio source ( egrs ) which is most certainly in the background of the ugc10288 field. we searched for sources for which both the ir and radio emission are point - like and for which the radio emission is sufficiently separated from the disk of ugc to allow a discrete measurement of flux density. the lowest radio flux density detection is associated with a discrete high - latitude emission feature on the north - west side of the disk ( at a projected distance of 2.5 kpc from the plane ). three different array configurations ( b, c, and d ) for this feature were investigated. all three configurations yield the same result : a non - thermal ( bragg - hill ) radio fraction as high as 54 %, compared to what is usually measured for this galaxy at radio frequencies, and low, but not significantly different from previous results for ngc 4631 and other galaxies with similar sfrs. a possible explanation for this is a reversal in the azimuthal components of the field due to a magnetic field compression in the arc. we do not detect any discrete high latitude radio emission associated with this feature. in summary, our observations suggest that radio continuum features are more likely to be seen above in - disk gaps in the northern arc, 2. 5 kpc above the plane, than below it, although a complex structure in this region may be present. we have combined the total intensity data from all three arrays to form a single, disentangled map along its spectral index, applicable to the intermediate frequency of 4.1 ghz. the resulting map has been used to correct the faint
we propose a versatile all - optical trap for ultra - cold atoms, based on a two - dimensional acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) rapidly scanned in space by a focused laser beam. we show that a relatively small and homogeneous ring trap can be created, with a trapping frequency of @xmath0 hz. we demonstrate that a rotation frequency of 15 khz is sufficient to trap a bose - einstein superfluid close to the critical temperature, and also to prevent parametric heating. to test the effect of the ring trap, we move a relativistic gas of 1 m atoms into the system, and create a superfluid that is consistent with our theoretical expectations. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2, phys. rev. lett. * # 1 *, 19#2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 # 1, j. phys. a : pure science, # 1 ( http://www.informatics.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-13-3-801. j. h. posthumususus, nature photonics * 3 *, # 4 ( # 5 ) [ cols="^,<,^",options="header ", ] quoted fig. 3 with the optical method implemented by r. _ et al. _ ( optical society of america, 1998 ) [ fig. 4 ]. the trap is complex, with three different inner rings and an outer ring. each ring represents a spatial combination of the two outer ring potentials. all of the inner rings can be fitted with a single sheet of optical light, allowing for the formation of a quasi - static optical potential. for a high enough rotation frequency the potential is time - averaged over a number of cycles, resulting in a trapped system that approaches blackbody temperature. for low rotation frequencies there are tunable tunable rf frequencies, which provide a continuous source of intensity, all the way from the optical system to the superfluid. rf - dressing is a sensitive and non - deterministic method for creating a trap. as the trapping frequency is much higher than the atomic trapping frequency, the noise on the rf is reduced, and in some cases the system is quiet.
we investigate the relative star - formation histories of bulge and disc components in galaxies of known redshift. our analysis is based on modelling the spatially resolved internal colours of galaxies drawn from the hubble deep field data. this sample constitutes the faintest statistically - complete spectroscopic redshift sample currently available in the hdf. the technique makes an explicit connection between evolutionary history and stellar populations. we use the dispersion around colour - colour tracks to distinguish between models that are degenerate in terms of integrated colour, and allow the star - forming histories of physically - distinct galactic subcomponents to be reconstructed. most importantly, internal colour analyses enable robust studies of _ relative ages _ by addressing the homogeneity of stellar populations and probing the order in which galactic components have been assembled. whereas most early - type systems in the sample have internal colour dispersions consistent with being old and coeval, _ over one - third _ of the early type systems studied do not_. this result contrasts with that derived from colour - magnitude diagrams for populations of spheroidals in distant rich clusters. we utilise the bouwens et al sample to illustrate how the method works. we partition the sample into sources of ellipticals and spirals and explore the history of star formation for both types. we find that the bulges are generally redder than their disks with a median age of @xmath0 gyr and that the disks are fairly red as well. most of the objects exhibit evidence for patchy dust content, competing with bulges for the most luminous objects. the results support the picture that bulges and disks are generally young, but that irregulars, particularly in clusters, pose a serious challenge to traditional models of galaxy evolution. we hope to make more robust predictions for the future evolution of our sample based on detailed modelling of the dust and gas content. for example, we expect resolved star formation to approximate instantaneous starbursts, and therefore should provide a valuable benchmark for models of hierarchical galaxy growth.
we present ground - based, good - seeing images of the central regions of 9 clusters at @xmath0 from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ). we perform a detailed morphological analysis of the galaxies in these clusters. we examine the relative occurrence of ellipticals, s0 s and spirals as a function of the cluster properties. we compare this phenomenon with similar studies at lower and higher redshifts, separately. we also examine the morphology - density relation of the total sample and of the high- and low - concentration clusters. our results support the evolutionary scenario in which the accretion of spirals into s0s is more efficient in low density regions than in high density ones. the above analysis is based on a relatively small cluster sample and, therefore, it needs to be confirmed by the morphological study of more sizeable samples. psfig.tex # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 110^#1 # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 6 # 7 # 8 # 9 # 10 # 12 # 13 # 14 10 # 15 # 16 # 17 # 18 # 19 # 14 # 20 # 21 # 22 # 23 # 24 # 25 # 26 # # = = = by 2 -0.5 cm plus 2pt minus 2pt # 1 _ apj _ # 1 ( # 2 ) # 3. # 1 by m. doussal, m. salles and p. n. comets, apj, london, uk, # 1 epsf.sty # 1 hep - th/99 - 016 + publ. astron.. japan ( # 1 only ), aip. nucl. sci., padova, italy. + e - mail : m.dudley@psif.org + _ url : _ http://www.pibeta.org/jordan/??? # 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 10 10 = cmr10 at 7.5pt + c.n. soc., p. l. m., a.g. ross, et al., to mark the centenary of the astronomer s 95th birthday.
we present a density functional ( df ) for liquid parahydrogen at finite temperatures. the df has the advantage of being easier to generalize to finite systems ( drops, liquid ph@xmath0 in confined geometries ) than the more complicated density functionals currently employed to study liquid helium. in particular, the df is suitable for studying the properties of liquid helium near its boiling point ( 20.3 k ), which is known to undergo a wetting transition to a liquid - vapor phase at a temperature above the triple point. we present the df for both coarse - grained and fully convex systems. a series of calculations aimed at showing that the df can be reliably used to study finite temperature properties of inhomogeneous planar liquid systems is presented, with a goal to compare the results with experiment and with quantum monte carlo simulations. as the liquid approaches the saturation line, cavitation in the vapor becomes active. we compute the density, the surface tension, and the speed of sound as a function of temperature and compare our results with the experimental data of hohenberg _ et al. _ @xcite. in addition, we present a simplified df and show that the lattice distortion at the critical temperature ( @xmath1 k ) can be reproduced by the df. in view of these results, we propose a final application of the df, in which we study the wetting and the cavitation of a rb planar surface covered by a homogeneous liquid film. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 p. prabhat, _ theory of condensed matter _ ( crc press, boca, 2009 ). s. ritter, s. beck, k. danzmann, and p. maunz, ` ` low temperature supercooling of helium by appealing to the van der waals effect, '' science * 312 *, 239 - 239 ( 2000 ). p. ben - abdallah and s. d. harris, _ investigations in atomic chemistry _ ( dover, new york, 2001 ). m. beck and m. d
we explore novel interactions between the collective dynamics of a system of polarizable scatterers in a cavity and the cavity field. we show that the resonant interaction can be tailored so that it modifies the reflectivity of the system and can be used to engineer collective optomechanical interactions. our analysis applies to systems of equidistant elements with one free - spectral range apart, i.e., membranes, atoms, molecules, dielectric microspheres, etc. our results are robust with respect to measurement errors in the positioning of individual elements and non - uniform membrane reflectivity or absorption. in highly - reflective arrays of highly - refractive elements we find a near - resonant linear coupling between elements, and describe this coupling in terms of a transfer matrix. this provides a practical route towards engineering strongly - coupled systems of atoms in cavities, and opens up the possibility of describing many systems with purely one - dimensional assemblies of optical elements. several recent experiments @xcite have shown that high - reflectivity atomic ensembles can be integrated into cavities with tens of thousands of elements. such systems may provide new capabilities for quantum information processing, and offer intriguing perspectives for the integration of quantum mechanical physics into optical devices. prominent examples include self - focusing atom photodissociation, in which individual atoms can be localized to a few atomic units, and single - molecule transistors, where a single molecule can interact with a thousand of coupled atoms. similar systems can be embedded in optical lattices and display many of the typical phenomena associated with quantum electrodynamics, such as electromagnetically induced transparency and cavity - induced transparency. the collective behavior of these systems is entirely characterised by the intensity of the scattering medium at each element of the ensemble, which, in turn, is determined by the parity of the elements in the ensemble. in many cases the array of elements has a high degree of polarizability, which makes it qualitatively different from a single - photon system. for example, the hysteretic shift of a membrane of polarisability @xmath0 can be controlled by changing its position relative to the cavity center by positioning the elements closer or farther apart, depending on the mutual sinusoidal coupling between the elements. in this paper we explore novel architectures for engineering strong collective interactions between light waves and photonic elements in optical cavities. in one proposed scheme a monochromatic light field propagating through a cavity is coupled to a collection of silicon nitride membranes by a field that has
the statistics of turbulent passive magnetic fields excited by advecting random flows is studied in the limit of a finite velocity correlation time. we develop a functional expansion method that allows us to calculate successive terms in the expansion and derive in closed form a functional expression of the result. the expansion is carried out up to the first order in the correlation length. this led to the appearance of an infinite hierarchy of equations for the characteristic function and various averaged response functionals of the magnetic field in the passive dynamo problem with finite correlation time ( boldyrev [ s.v. kazantsev, phys. rev. e * 81 *, 061302 ( 2000 ) ] ). we demonstrate that the one - point statistics of the passive magnetic field are _ universal _ in the sense that they only depend on one small - scale property of the velocity velocity : the time integral of its gradients, @xmath0. however, at a larger scale, i.e., for large magnetic prandtl numbers, the very large - scale universality is lost. in this regime, the functional expansion results in a _ first - order _ correction to the growth rate of the amplitudes of the fluctuations, which follows from the loss of galilean invariance and leads to a reduction of approximately 40 % in the three - dimensional case and to a similar reduction in the momentum transfer to the turbulent eddies. our semiquantitative analysis of the finite - correlation - time expansion yields results that are approximately consistent with numerical simulations. in the limits of extremely large and slowly spinning eddies, the reduction of the fluctuation - to - eddy ratio is approximately equal to what would be expected in a steady - state evolution of the random - field equations of motion. these results are in good agreement with recent numerical evidence that suggests that eddies in rotating plasmas, particularly massive ones, can complete the ` ` stretch twist fold '' scenario and exhibit significantly faster dynamics than their counterparts in a rotating torus.
the onshore wind farm is the fastest growing energy sector in europe, and its performance is also rapidly dependent on wind energy density and temperature. however, the detailed dynamics of wind farm, as well as the statistics of wind speed fluctuations, are not well tractable. in this paper, we develop a stochastic model for the conversion of the electrical power output of the entire wind farm into a power curve, thus obtaining a probabilistic description of the wind farm dynamics. the model estimates the wind power output at a sampling frequency of 1hz, and is able to reproduce the complex properties of the measurement, including its intermittent features. we promote the drift coefficient and the corresponding langevin power curve as improved macroscopic estimates for wind farm performance monitoring. using the iec monitoring software, we detect a significant anomaly in the power curve on time scales of @xmath0 of the time, which can be enough to detect the presence of turbulence even if the farm is very large. as a consequence, we improve forecasts for wind power at 1hz. the added insight helps understand the dynamical response of large wind installations to wind fluctuations, such as smart grid concepts. [ sec : intro ] substructure of the european wind energy system. [ cols="^",options="header ", ] the current situation is as follows : there is a wind farm on the onshore, and it is monitoring the thermodynamic state of the sea as it is driven by the tide. there are three main sources of power : the wind speed, which is the sum of the contributions of individual wind turbines, and the noise from mechanical systems. the first has a strong impact on the dynamic performance of the farm : it leads the system to improve performance at the shortest time scales. in particular, the largest and most dynamic wind farm shows the largest level of degradation, so that it is more reactive to wind disruptions. the second source of power is the temperature. in winter, the temperature increases with wind energy and so does the temperature of the turbine gas. this explains why the temperature is lower than the wind energy. there is also an abundance of wind stress, i.e. the turbines are subjected to a high mechanical load. the draining of the mechanical energy from the sea is the main determinant of the performance of wind turbines. to account for this, a range of models has been proposed, ranging from models for the direct energy conversion ( cfd ) to models where the energy is directly stored in small reservoirs, e.g. a
we present 1.52.5 @xmath0 m spectra of six seyfert galaxies of both types with an ionization cone and/or jets. the aim of the study is to determine the distribution of the molecular material in the galaxies, and to determine, in a quantitative way, the strength of the coronal emission lines. these lines are detected in all galaxies except ngc 1386, ngc 1566 and ngc 5128, for which lower resolution spectra are available. the ratios of the emission lines detected in each galaxy show a weak trend as a function of distance from the nucleus and a comparison with normal spiral galaxies. is the strongest observed line in the sy1 ngc 1097, and in ngc 3227. the strongest line is also detected in, although it is weak compared to other lines. the observed ratios of 2 to 10 s(1 ) in different galaxies indicate that the 2 is excited by uv and optical heating in the material on the surface of the slit, and that it is probably further excited by x - rays. we find that is the most likely origin for the 2 emission. on the other hand, the tentative evidence from the x - ray emission for the hot 2 suggests that star formation occuring in the central regions of the galaxies may not have taken place in the recent past. our observations suggest that uv heating is the dominant mechanism for the generation of the 2emission in the 6 galaxies with active nuclei, while collisionally excited emission is the main driver for the observed line ratios. we discuss the possible implications of this result for the non - detection of optical emission lines in the jets of the 6 nearby galaxies. in forthcoming publications, we shall present the results of our study of the nearby, nearby, giant molecular cloud ( gcm ) of the first six galaxies in our sample, and discuss their implications in the context of current galaxy evolution models.
we show that any geometric elimination procedure is in a suitable sense universal ", avoiding " graphical branchings " and able to compute zariski closures of constructible sets. in particular, we show that robustness necessarily requires linear time on infinitely many inputs. [ theorem]corollary [ theorem1 ] shows that any holomorphic encoding may be replaced by a continuous one of similar size. we retake the subject of this paper for the task of the elimination of a single quantifier block. suppose that @xmath0 is any quantifier encoding a given object class. the value question for this data structure is called the _ value question _ associated to the quantifier. in order to decouple the unmodelled from the real ones _ superexponential _ ( sequential ) time is necessary ( and sufficient ) by means of interpolation techniques to eliminate a _ non - polynomial _ data structure. this problem is by no means unique. there are algorithms, including those based on grbner theory, which can achieve a doubly exponential complexity even on a very small input space. however, these algorithms require the dense and sparse encoding of the object ( e.g. integers are encoded by their bit representation, polynomials by their coefficients, etc. ). therefore, standard complexity theory searches for an efficient algorithm answering the mathematical questions under consideration and tries to certify the optimality of this algorithm. a common way to solve this identity question consists of the transformation of the ( supposedly ambiguous ) data structure in a new one. we use the familiar symbol of ` ` symbolic elimination '' to transmit the information of the given procedure to a given one. symbolic elimination is proved to be a general technique for the solution of specific geometric elimination problems. for the main problem of interest, namely the is it possible to find a data structure encoding the corresponding output objects in a time faster than the corresponding input codes? in the first case, the known lower bound for the complexity of arithmetic circuit based elimination is applied. it turns out that a suitable numerical adaptation of the above mentioned new symbolic elimination algorithm has the best complexity performance between all known numerical elimination algorithms.

recent work has shown that it is possible to determine the number of chiral edge modes of two - dimensional periodically driven systems by analyzing the spectrum of their edge states. in both static and driven systems, this results in a loss of information which is sufficient to predict the complete floquet band structure above and below the band. because the band structure of a driven system is bounded, the information gained by knowing the chern numbers of all floquet bands is not sufficient to accurately predict the edge state spectrum. in this work we analyze this gap in the floquet spectrum by constructing new invariants for a system with periodic and non - periodic driving fields. the addition of a weak driving field provides novel insight into how the topological properties of edge states of a periodically driven system are different from those of a static system. the most striking example of these differences occurs when the system is defined in a finite geometry with an edge, as in the case of the haldane model. we find that the fundamental boundary condition for this type of system is that there must be a periodic time - dependent schrdinger equation, the evolution of which is conveniently described in terms of floquet states. our invariant, computed for a real system, is in excellent agreement with the one derived from a model of strongly modulated hopping amplitudes. will such systems ever be realized experimentally?? the widespread availability of topologically interesting systems in the physical and biological sciences provides an ideal setting in which to study the effects of non - equilibrium driving fields on fundamental properties of solids. in particular, it is desirable to identify topological invariants which fully capture the behavior of the system at different times within the driving period. in solid state systems, these properties can be captured by the _ edge state _ behaviour of a band gap, a periodic or quasi - periodic feature of the hamiltonian, whose quasi - energy @xmath0 is defined on a brillouin zone@xcite. consider, for example, an atomic, solid state, or a photonic system in a flux - limited flux - lattice configuration where, periodically, the driving field is applied across the edge, resulting in a periodic band structure ( see e.g. fig.[figsquare]a ). what happens in this case is the system could acquire a ` ` band gap '', an anomalous shemitian scattering state which can only exist at a discrete time in the entire lattice. this is analogous to the case in which discrete time and spatial translation symmetries are
we present an atlas of high resolution iras observations of all 106 of the widely separated ( @xmath0 m flux density greater than 5.24 jy ) paired galaxy systems observed in the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iras ) bright galaxy sample ( rbgs ). these data were obtained with the hires instrument at the canada - france - hawaii telescope. the fluxes and colors of these paired galaxies are compared to those of a sample of isolated galaxies and compared to morphological optical classifications. we find no significant difference in the far - infrared properties between the paired galaxies and the isolated galaxies. this is surprising in view of previous claims of the opposite frequency of interactions and enhanced star formation in pairs of galaxies, and provides further evidence that star formation is triggered in very advanced merger systems where the centers of the galaxies are nearly aligned, as suggested by the presence of companions within a few kiloparsecs. we also present an analysis of the flux and color distributions of the early and late type spirals in the sample, and find that they have a significantly different distribution of infrared properties. in particular, we do not find any evidence for a significant enhancement of far - ir activity in the late - type spiral galaxies, as has been suggested in previous studies. instead, we find that the flux of the bright end of the spiral population ( as defined by morphological classification from the iras bright galaxy survey data ) is consistent with what would be expected if all spirals and ellipticals were in nearly aligned pairs, with a cut - off for star formation at 60@xmath1 m, as expected in a merger merger. this indicates that while the high levels of interaction and star formation activity seen in some spirals is not likely to result from highly advanced mergers, galaxies farther away from the merger center tend to evolve passively. we discuss the implications of these results for the understanding of the star formation process and the efficiency of mass accretion in such systems.
the gj@xmath0876 planetary system is unusual among extrasolar planetary systems in that its two planets are locked in oscillatory resonance configurations at the ratio 2:1 orbital resonances. this is an analog to the io - europa system of jupiter and saturn, but the two resonances are nearly aligned and the orbital eccentricities are much larger. this suggests that the two orbits are nearly coplanar, and as such their periapse precessions are dominated by resonant terms whose cosine arguments are linear combinations of the resonance variables librating about @xmath0. in this paper we describe a migration process due to the gravitational interaction between the two planets and the nebular disk surrounding the young star, osculating in a self - consistent manner by means of a series of numerical simulations. we first show that capture of the planets into the two mean - motion resonance resonances at the 2: 1 means - motion commensurability requires eccentricity damping if the eccentricities start reasonably small and the rate of migration is not too fast. if there is no eccentricity detraining, migration of the resonantly locked planets leads to rapid growth in their orbitalentricities that exceed the observed eccentricities. we specify the conditions under which this can happen and show that in the absence of ganymede, or in the presence of tidal dissipation, eccentricity growth only occurs for sufficiently large eccentricities of about 7 %. in that case, continued migration with an indefinite duration of time scales drives the planets toward each other, and their migration should remain finite if the planet - star mass ratio of the outer planet is comparable to that of the inner planet. we show that this is possible only if the separation of the two originally widely separated orbits is very small, and if the secular resonance variable of the secular orbit librates at an angle of about @ x -0.5 to the relative major axis of the star. continued migration after only a very short duration of migration leads to continued capture into the 5:2 orbital resonance ; this resonance is particularly interesting because it would persist even for long periods of very low eccentricities as the resonance amplitude becomes comparable to or larger than the largest resonance value. in fact, it might be the first example of the ` ` dual resonance '' regime for detached planetary systems. we also show that the possibility of secular resonance capture in the system is allowed only when both planets are near apoapse and both have masses very similar to those in the gj
a model of the bare neucleon - nucleon force based on the dyson equation is applied to the calculation of the neutron green functions of the nucleus @xmath0sn. phonon - induced interaction and self - energy processes are treated in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer plus bloch - horowitz ( bcs+bh ) approximation. a state - dependent gap is obtained in the gap equation, resulting from the exchange of phonons between pairs of nucleons moving in time reversal states close to the fermi level. the quasiparticle approximation, which assumes no pairing, works well for most of the single - particle levels. however, when addition of a monopole - pairing force, in comparison with the usual bcs approach, the gap obtained is significantly enlarged and results are found to be inconsistent with the results obtained considering only the low - lying phonons. the bcs green function is calculated making use of the fact that the ground state of the system is time - invariant, i.e., invariant in the sense that each phonon mode contributes to the spectrum of modes. the contribution to the total ground state energy arising from pairing correlations is shown to be large and independent of the particle number and of the pairing correlation energy.,,, and pacs : 13.40.mg, 12.38.bx, 24.10.lx, 25.85.+q, 27.20.cp, 34.60.+d the recent experiments on the neutron magnetic susceptibility of atomic ensembles have brought new information on strongly - coupled nuclei. in particular attention to the problem of the strength of individual nucleons interacting via the vibrations induced on the nucleon surface ( see, e.g., ref. @xcite ). it is now well established that such kind of coupling plays a significant role in the dynamics of weakly - coupled nucleus - nucleus interactions. this has an important implication in nuclear physics, since it has been shown that the induced interaction leads to a strong renormalization of elementary excitation mechanisms, like the power - law oscillations of the electric field, which can lead to important modifications of low - temperature superconductivity and magnetism, as well as to the development of novel devices such as giant resonances. at the same time, the effect of such a coupling on normal and anomalous nuclei has been studied theoretically, by comparing perturbative results obtained by means of perturbation theory with calculations made using
the binary x - ray pulsar gx 1 + 4 is unique in several respects. it is the only known pulsar in a symbiotic system and the neutron star magnetic field is known to be @xmath0 g - the strongest field in the known high mass x - rays binaries. from previous observations it has been established that the source undergoes a luminosity minimum followed by a re - brightening at low timescales. optical spectroscopy suggests that this minimum is accompanied by a rapid increase in the source luminosity. the optical spectrum is characterised by strong emission lines from hei, feii and [ fevii ] which are associated with the circumstellar matter. when the luminosity is high, the profiles are asymmetric and leading edge bright during the early observations. by the end of the observations the profiles had changed to trailing edge bright profiles normally associated with neutron star spin - up. evidence from two dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations provides evidence that the change in the profile is caused by a reversal of the angular momentum of the existing accretion disc. the reversal occurs on the same timescale as the torque reversal, i.e. the material torque is reversed on the outer boundary of the disc at the same rate as it would on the inner boundary. thus the disc reversal is probably caused by the same instability mechanism operating in the inner disc and not the outer. we describe a possible solution in which, during the low intensity state, accretion is controlled by x - radiation heating leading to an unstable negative feedback mechanism, which, when increased, converts to a rotationally dominant mechanism. the increased accretion raises the trapped matter until the thermal velocity exceeds the escape velocity driving off trapped matter and suppressing accretion from the stellar wind. the system is then re - monitored several months later by the burst and transient source experiment on board the compton gamma ray observatory. we discuss the implications of these results in the context of current accretion models. 50 # 1@xmath1 # 1#2#3#1, _ # 2 _, * # 3 *, # 4 = 1.0 cm
we elucidate the general structure of low energy effective field theory ( eft ) for the adiabatic mode of a theory described by a single effective scalar minimally coupled to gravity at low energies. as a corollary, the nambu - goldstone boson, corresponding to the broken time translation invariance of the parent theory, is shown to be the salient book - keeping device around which successive terms in the derivative expansion naturally organize themselves. by explicitly integrating out the heavy modes, we are able to deduce an effective theory valid to all orders in field perturbations, and which reduces the effective speed of sound for the long wavelength quasi - long wavelengths. when the trajectory of the inflaton is parametrized by the radius of curvature in field space, the resulting eft describes the physics of the underlying parent theory to very high accuracy. in particular, we show that the coupling of the eft expansion to the background inflaton trajectory is strongly dependent on the background trajectory and the mass of the heavy fields that couple to it, generating large levels of primordial non - gaussianity consistent with slow - roll, in contrast to the naive expectation that this variation can be slowly - rolled. by contrast, the perturbative expansion itself can vary rapidly enough ( i.e., too slowly ) in time to cause the lagrangian of the trajectory to change form, violating gauge invariance, even in the limit of large eft amplitudes. these features are signatures of the transient nature of the relevant interactions in the theory, and suggest that additional, potentially observable, effects of these interactions might be detectable. in what follows, we attempt to elucidate further the features of this single field eft approach through a generalization of the framework introduced in a previous paper, with the goal of relating the low energy eft to cosmological observables.
high - resolution _ cobe _ observations of the hubble deep field have detected the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) at 140 and 240 @xmath0 m. the measured intensities and spectral densities are consistent with the intensity of the ebl expected from the cumulative emission from various pregalactic objects, protogalaxies and galaxies throughout the history of the universe. these studies have substantially strengthened our previous conclusions that stellar systems, brown dwarfs and galaxies can not produce the observed ebl. in this paper, we examine some cosmological implications of the dirbe and firas detections of ebl emission at wavelengths between 140 and 5000 @xfig0 m in the presence of a potential foreground source. the main conclusions are ( 1 ) _ the spectrallyintegrated ebl at these wavelengths should arise from a much larger fraction of _ all _ the energy released in the universe since the recombination epoch, and ( 2 ) it is highly likely that some non@xmath6nuclear energy sources, such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and cataclysmic variables, may contribute to the observed intensity, but their relative contribution is uncertain because of the unknown properties of the agn torus. the contribution of agns to the infrared background, if significant, is likely to be weak and can not have anything to do with the specific geometry of the torus around the active nucleus. a third source of energy if the infrared ebl is dominated by a galactic black hole or a peculiar starburst, is perhaps a result of the nuclear release of energy that is radiated in the mid - ir and possibly absorbed and reradiated into the infrared. however, the infrared luminosity density produced by these various sources does not increase with redshift significantly over the observed star formation history, and thus does not provide a strong constraint on the star formation rate either at high or low redshifts. the relative contribution of black holes, agns, and proto- and massive starbursts to the total infrared background obtained by the firas instruments is more uncertain.
this is the fourth paper of a series in which we investigate the use of an atmospheric mesoscale model for the purpose of simulating the optical turbulence at mt graham. the model is a combination of an optical model ( meso - nh ) developed jointly by des recherches mtorologiques et laboratoire darologiques ( cnrm - mto - france ) and generalized scidar ( gs ). it is based on the observation of binaries with typical separations @xmath0 ( 3 - 10@xmath1 ), ( 5 - 6,m=0.5 - 0.8 mag ) and ( 1 - 5,m(m=1 ). a large statistical sample of observations is used to calibrate the model. the calibration is done on a sample of 34 nights corresponding to the whole dataset studied. the most important results obtained in this study are : ( i ) we have proved that the model calibration definitely improves the model performance. the vertical distribution of the internal optical turbulence ( i.e. the average of all observations, see, isoplanatic angle and wavefront coherence time ) matches very well with the corresponding measured @xma0-profile. if we look at the model behaviour in different seasons, we show evidence of a possible bias ( of the order of 1 - 3 yr ) between the best seeing and the worst seeing in the high part of the atmosphere ( h @xcite ) due to the saturation of the model in summer. this bias is removed / removed when we use a sub - sample of the observed data not used for the calibration. ( ii ) for the model we obtained a typical of the operational conditions ( very good and bad turbulence conditions ) reconstructed by the model with a correlation coefficient of ( c.c. ( v ) if we consider cumulative errors night by night for the seeing, we find extremely encouraging results. the median value of the relative errors is indeed extremely small with only a small deviation from the real conditions in the free atmosphere. ( iii ) the seeing is slightly deviates from the operational mode on the whole height from the ground to 20 km but it is always very good with a dispersion of only 0.1 %.

recently, it was discovered that the hard x - ray tail ( hrc ) characteristics of some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed with the doppler effect could be interpreted in terms of signatures of the curvature effect [ 6,15 - 18,22 - 18 ]. it was found that the hardness ratio of some fred pulses of grbs shows a sharp rise at the start of the decay phase and a gradual decrease thereafter. based on this result, we re - examine the characteristics of the hrcs of the three fred pulse bursts studied in this paper to ask if any of these effects could give rise to the characteristics observed in the light curves of these bursts. first, we consider the case of a typical batse count which is defined as that for which the raw hardness ratio drops with time depending on the pulse decay rate. we find that the variations in the measured count could be accounted for by various effects, the most important of which are the following two : a ) the variation of the position angle of the emitting areas to the line - of - sight when the angle is greater than @xmath0ms and b ) an apparent difference in the total intensity of the detected photons emitted in the co - moving frame between the beam centre and the fireball surface. while the first effect would lead to the main part of the light curve, the second one might yield the similar characteristics, the third one might alter the curve of the overall light curve. we also try to make a fit to the observed hrc light curves by allowing the channel light curves to evolve with the observed light curves in the energy range of the bursts concerned. due to the similarities between these two processes, it is concluded that the considered for the three bursts are in agreement with each other. finally, as a secondary investigation, we also consider the cases of a spherical fireball and a uniform jet which emit radiation within the same region of the fireball when their opening angle is large enough. our analysis suggests that an intrinsic hard - to - soft spectral evolution of grb pulses could be the cause of the observed phenomenon of the spectral softening with time which is generally observed in bursts of this type. gamma - rays : bursts radiation mechanisms : nonthermal, compton radiation effects
in this paper, we present an experimental system to instruct students in the basics of ray and wave optics using a modern microscope. the light microscope is a basic apparatus used in many disciplines, including physics, materials science, chemistry, and the life sciences. the class ` ` advanced optics electrodynamics '' course was held in the fall of 2007 at carnegie mellon university in new york. the goal of the course was to learn the components and techniques necessary to build a working microscope, whether they be optical microscope, slit microscope, or tube lens, and to practice these components and microscope in a controlled way. for this course, four experiments were done simultaneously by 2 to 3 students each, using different optical condensers and building an advanced system. in each experiment, students made multiple measurements of the magnification and resolution of their system. through these measurements, students learned the concepts of accuracy and precision in measurement techniques and how to estimate their uncertainty. this class was required to get an associate s degree in optics in the spring of 2007. the students used the same concepts and experimental systems for the two experiments where they built an optical microscope. in the present article, we detail the components, apparatus, illumination path, and condenser for an e - fluorescence microscope that was used in the class. the optical components required to build the microscope are described and measured, and we show examples of how they work together to create magnification and precise measurements. we also describe an analysis method using a sine wave method to find the spacing between the lines of a diffraction grating. using this method, the students have built a microscope with a large number of small gratings. they have shown that a half - inch long rod is able to move lines of length @xmath0 m with a accuracy of 10 - 100 % for the largest and smallest iris radii. the technique of super - resolution fitting is shown to be useful in order to enable students to obtain an accurate measurement of the length of the objective and to create an accurate image of the diffraction lines.
we have used observations of the evolution of the mean surface brightness, absolute magnitude, and linear radius for 34 high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) early - type galaxies in three clusters, cl 1324 + 3011, cl 1604 + 4304, and cl 1654 + 4321, to examine the tolman surface brightness effect using the theories of bruzual & charlot. the three clusters have redshifts of 0.7565, 0.8967, and 0.9243, and a surface brightness difference of 1.0 mag / arcsec. we find that the correlation of surface brightness versus absolute magnitude contains only a single dose, on the assumption that the radius does not change, and therefore can not be interpreted as a redshift - distance relation. we measure the luminosity evolution of these galaxies using spectral synthesis models with varying star formation histories. comparing the observed luminosity brightening with look - back time, the models allow us to calculate the ages of the observed galaxies using the concordance model of postman & lauer ( 1998, 2001 ). for the three highest redshift clusters, the epoch of star formation when the universe was half its present age is slightly after the initial starburst, i.e. we do not find any evidence for a postulated recession in the age - luminosity relation. in the models used in this program, the initial mass function is assumed to be a function of distance from the observer. using the de sitter metric, we find, in each case, that the linear radii of the galaxies are decreased by a few percent with increasing redshift, in the sense that at a given absolute magnitude the radius of a galaxy is approximately half the area of its hubble diagram. this depletion is similar to the effect that was introduced in the local universe by zwicky ( 1929 ). anticipating the present experiment, we set out here the ` ` cosmological ages '' for these galaxies, given by the redshift relation given by songaila et al. ( 1998 ; 1999 ). the oldest epoch in the universe ( 4.82 gyr ) is equal to 4.30 gyr. with the present data, we will strengthen the present test.
the @xmath0-model is a quantum probability model that describes a continuous transition from quantum to classical degrees of freedom. we have studied it by means of the ` hidden measurement formalism ', that we have been elaborating in brussels, focusing on the measurement problem, the schrdinger cat paradox, the classical limit and the problem of non - locality. within this formalism we have identified the physical aspects that are the origin of the different structural differences between the quantum world and the classical world. we shall show that all the paradoxes of standard quantum theory that are due to the fact that quantum is used as a universal theory, also being applied to macroscopic system, for example the measuring apparatus, are not present in the standard quantum mechanics. our result shows that it is possible to formulate a ` classical limit'of the theory : in this limit a quantum measurement has two effects : ( 1 ) it changes the state of the system and ( 2 ) it produces probability due to a lack of knowledge about the nature of this change. since the quantum machine we have invented, it is always the same state, representing the same physical reality. we can apply the theory to the situation of a quantum system in which we have a local minimization of the process, we also have the two related effects : there is a maximum of the amount of knowledge that is needed to perform a local measurement, and this corresponds to a classical mixture of a set of classical hidden measurements. for a classical hidden measurement we would have the maximum of knowledge leading to a local maximum in one of the above mentioned effects, while for a local minimalization the situation where the unitary has maximum knowledge is characterized by the classical spread of the probability distribution. in both these cases the quantum structures are isomorphic to the structure of the underlying complex hilbert space. finally, the theory of locality is not localizable in the sense that there is no location of particles behind the slit. we define a probability distribution for a quantum spin measurement that corresponds to the distribution of positions of the points in the double slit.
we present the evolution of the rest - frame near - ir luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in the hubble deep field - south ( hdf - s ) for a sample of about 300 galaxies selected at ks@xmath0 from the two degree field ( 2df ) at @xmath1. we use photometric redshift spectroscopy to construct a photometric catalogue of the galaxies. the lf in the 3.5 mm - band is compared with the predictions of models based on lyman break galaxies using a set of five stellar mass templates selected from the 2df. for a control sample of 232 galaxies, we find a reasonable agreement between the local and the high - resolution ir - derived lf. we confirm the presence of the bi - modality and provide evidences of luminosity and of density evolution down to 0.2 - 0.3 magnitude in the redshift range probed. the luminosity evolution of our sample is consistent with the local lf if the slope of the best - fitting logarithmic expansion factor is allowed to vary with redshift. we find hints of a raise of the faint end of the near - infrared lf when extrapolating from the observed k - band photometry at low redshift, although the specific properties we obtain are not consistent with those found at similar redshifts by other authors at comparable redshift and with local luminosity densities. the significance of such a raise is less clear due to the fact that galaxies with irregular spectra and/or morphology do not show a significant evolution in the mean value of their spectral energy distribution. given the size of our control sample, we do not find evidence of a steepening nor a change in the characteristic lf slope ( m = -1.12.0 ) as has previously been found in the comparison with the lfs at optical wavelengths and, in the case of the blue component of galaxies, the ratio of early - type to late - type galaxies. + [ firstpage ] galaxies : evolution galaxies : formation galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies : photometry
multiplet _ ligand _ field theory ( mlft ) is applied to the correlated transition - metal compounds nio, mno and srtio@xmath3. the basic idea is that the one electron potential in the local density approximation ( lapw ) and the warped muffin - tin approximation ( lda ) are combined in order to calculate the one - electron potential from the ( fully selfconsistent ) lda basis set. because of the limited overlap of the orbital degrees of freedom with the atomic states, the lda core - level potential is not maximally localized, and therefore the essential part of the coulomb interaction has to be maximally screened. the calculated potential has been used to compare experiment and theory for several established spectroscopic features of these compounds. the comparison shows that the mlft calculations are in agreement with the experimental spectra except for the crystal - field splitting which is almost 10 % too high in nio. we show that the splittingscale for the o @xmath4 orbitals in our lda - based mlft calculation is about 10 % larger than that for the slater integrals. however, the multiplet splitting due to the screening is not important in deciding which of the two potentials will be realized in the experiment, and it is not even important for the core excitations. the inelastic x - ray scattering technique has been applied to separate the optically thin inner shell excitations from the high- and low - energy states of nio and mno. the compared spectra of these oxides show that many of the features can be captured by mlft theory, but some features are completely absent from local calculations. _ keywords _ : multiplet, multiplet, field theory, excitonic, electron, transition metal. + * pacs number(s ) : * 05.70.-a, 05.75.-y, 42.50.lc, 43.60.+c, 41.60.-r, 4110.jv + * msc * : 51.20.-m, 71.10.lq * key words : * multiblock footnote omitted * + + +
we develop a low mach number fluctuating hydrodynamics code to study the development of gravitational instabilities in non - ideal ternary mixtures of fluids, and use it to study flows over a broad range of reynolds numbers ( @xmath0 ), including giant concentration fluctuations, diffusion - driven instabilities, and reverse diffusion. much less is known about multispecies mixtures ( multicomponent mixtures ), both theoretically and experimentally, than is commonly known despite their ubiquity in nature and technological processes. we use our algorithm, which is based on a finite - volume solver for isothermal navier - stokes equations, to develop a formulation of the momentum and mass fluxes in a barycentric frame, to combine the deterministic and stochastic solutions of the hydrodynamic equations. this formulation is based closely on the recent monograph by kuiken, which contains a nearly complete formulation except for some differences that may cause some confusion between ideal and non ideal mixtures. thermal fluctuations are formulated by fitting the formulation into the generic framework, relying heavily on the work of ottinger [ j. chem. phys. * 113 *, 621 ( 2002 ) ]. a substantial part of the difficulty is in obtaining analytical results from this formulation, due to the much larger initial vortices in the nonlinear approximation than in the usual unperturbed ( thermal ) equations, and the increased complexity of the equations. using simulations in a hele - shaw geometry, we investigate the development and growth of giant nonlinear instabilities that occur when there are at least two distinct diffusion coefficients. the nature of the instability and its spatial extent allows us to access the relation between thermal fluctuations and the nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations for the first time, and we use these limits to establish a connection between spatial extent and stability of convection, diffusion, and buoyancy. we find good qualitative agreement between our simulations and experimental results, despite being dominated by small - scale fluctuations. based on our simulations we also discuss the possible implications of a different geometry in which the equilibrium concentration fluctuations are no longer zero and are strongly suppressed relative to the equilibrium thermal fluctuations.
we present _ xmm - newton _ observations of the interacting galaxy pair ngc 2207/ic 2163 in the ultraviolet, radio continuum, h@xmath0, @xmath1, and radio synchrotron, and _ spitzer _ irac, mips, and keck telescope observations. the x - ray observations show the large scale shock fronts in each galaxy pair and the associated star - forming clumps on each side of the shock. the mean ratio of the radio continuum flux density to the flux of far - infrared radiation is 0.81, which is the same ratio found for giant radio h ii regions in m81, but only about half of the ratio for the small kpc - sized clumps in this pair. we find that neither the large - scale shock front along the _ eyelids _ nor the small - scale ridge near the _ ne radio ridge _ is a strong, strongly - collimated magneto - rotational shock. we conclude that either the gas pressures in the two galaxies are comparable, and/or the gas temperatures are higher in the companions than in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) environment. we do not detect the predicted soft x - rays from diffuse hot plasma at the large scales shock fronts. as previously reported by @xcite, we find faint extended x -ray emission from the companion galaxy pair x2. the best candidate for the source is sn 1999ec. with our new radio continuum data, we confirm the presence of a faint, compact source in x2, although it is rather faint and may be associated with a background quasar. the spectrum of this source is rather hard and is consistent with a seyfert 2 agn. we also find an optically thin, optically - thin, high - ionization layer near the bright end of the narrow line of sight in the _ hst _ images. this may be a candidate for a type ib supernova. we detect nine possible ulx candidates and conclude that, at best, two of them may be type ib while the remaining four may be faint radio supernovae.
the baryon asymmetry of the universe has finally been determined at the electroweak phase transition. independent of the intriguing non - perturbative features of the symmetric phase, which require further studies, this provides a quantitative determination of the thermodynamics of the transition. a comparison is made with lattice simulations and perturbation theory based on the effective three - dimensional higgs model which describes the high - temperature limit of the standard model. it is shown that close to the critical temperature, near the transition the sphaleron processes generate a first - order phase transition which is accompanied by a jump in the order parameter. the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis is discussed and is shown to be generically possible in grand unified theories with right - handed neutrinos @xmath0. # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

we investigate mass, metallicity, and energy feedback from star formation - driven galactic outflows over cosmic time, using new cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. the simulations use an improved version of the gadget-2 code. we track metal production from type ii sne, type ia sne, and active galactic nuclei ( agb ) stars. there are significant differences between our models, especially at low-@xmath0, where our models accurately match the star formation history of the universe. our results suggest that delayed feedback from agb stars may have a more profound impact on metal enrichment history at low redshifts than the feedback from supernovae alone. at @xmath1, our model fails to reproduce even the most basic observed features of the intracluster medium ( igm ), including the spatial distribution of metals. the impact of agb feedback is most noticeable in the warm phase of the warm - phase igm, where galaxies expel a significant fraction of their gas. this cold phase is particularly marked in quasar spectra tracing the igm. we then consider the metal cycle within galaxies. our models broadly reproduce quasar absorption line observations, but they do not quite fit the observed gas - phase abundances or the correlation between galaxy and igm metal content. this tension is partially resolved by our new simulations, which include a full treatment of momentum - driven winds and provide more accurate expressions of wind parameters. the models are able to successfully reproduce a variety of observed phenomena including the gas mass - loading of supernova ejecta, abundance variations within and among galaxies, abundance gradients within the icm, and x - ray and uv ionization of the gas. in contrast to previous treatments, this study fully takes into account the physical physics of outflows, including physical constraints such as particle group finders, and their alignment with the local potential and stellar mass. consequently, we can address the important question of how do galaxies obtain their metals in situ, and how this depends on the potential well of a particle.
we study the large - scale, stochastic dynamics of the angle - field nonlinear partial differential equation of an active nematic director, at thermal equilibrium. the equation of motion for the orientational order parameter exhibits two independent terms whose interpretations are based on a renormalization - group analysis. one term is specific to the director, and the other to the substrate ; both terms arise as variational derivatives of a free - energy functional. in the case of a two - dimensional substrate the two terms are related by feynman graphs of three types propagator, noise strength and nonlinearity. as a consequence of rotation invariance the stiffnesses in the spatiotemporally white gaussian noise have equal - time correlations with respect to the free energy, and can be obtained from the gaussian probability distribution function. since the nonlinearities are marginally relevant the effective stiffnesses become equal at large scales, and are nonsingular, even for a director with a small elastic moduli. in particular, we find that the franke - arnold - pitaevskii equations are equivalent to the frank free energy equations for the angle field at small wavenumbers, once the small - angle free energy is taken from the continuum free energy. we also find agreement between the frank theory and direct numerical analysis of pelcovits _ et al. _ ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2013.10.012[comp. phys. comm. * 199 *, 133 - 138 ( 2013 ) ]. a. born and e. wolf, _ nematics _ ( cambridge, new york, 1983 ). e. bettencourt, c. cohen - tannoudji, and g. weisskopf, ` ` ` active nematics are driven by chaotic chaos, '' phys. rev. lett. * 58 *, 551 - 554 ( 1990 ). w. ducker, a. patel, and a. faridani e. likeria ` ` thermal evaporation and desorption of isotropic particles from a solid surface, '' j. phys. b : at. mol. opt. * 38 *, 8488 - 8495 ( 2004 ). r. j. w. nordholt, phys. rep., * 48 *, 87 - 90 ( 2003 ). h. s. gell - mann, g. a. shelby, and
the crab pulsar is a nearby, low luminosity soft gamma ray repeater ( sgr ), widely regarded as a possible neutron star. the nebula emits strong nonthermal emission from radio to x - rays, and is known to contain a thin disk wind ( wisp ) between the rotational engine and the x - ray torus. this and other nebular features may be the direct evidence of particle acceleration in the equatorial wind of the pulsar. i summarize the current status of this nebula and its nebula, and summarize the models for the origin of the high energy particles that are observed primarily in @xmath0 rays ( primarily synchrotron ). # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1#2 _ the messenger _ # 1 enrico fermi # 1 ( # 2 ) # 3..5 in.25 in for a considerable time, the planet earth s magnetosphere has been shrouded in a veil of mystery surrounding a pulsar, whose spin down luminosity exceeds the total nebular luminosity by more than an order of magnitude and is extending out to at least several arcseconds from its equator. the nature of the putative pulsar - nebula interaction is not well understood. the most commonly accepted picture is that the wind ( or at least the dense part of a polar outflow ) is the site of the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies, with electrons and positrons as the main constituents. however, other explanations have been suggested, including the possibility of a corrugated equatorial return current sheet. these models do not fully specify the geometry, but do give a measure of the energy loss rate in pairs. recent work has suggested that both the radial profile of the outflow wind and the nebular emission may be consistent with this interpretation. gamma ray observations of the crab have suggested, at times recently controversial, the possibility that the line of sight to the crab is curved, in the direction of the poles, perhaps indicating the presence of a magnetized wind from the companion star.
we present a new regularization scheme which is supposed to regularize the initial lorentz invariant loop graphs. more specifically, we show that the regularized ilis should be independent of the basic mass scale and the number of regulators ( or regularization quanta ) when they are approaching to the infinitely large end - states of interest. according to the regularization, the slope of the sliding energy scale ( or ses ) is set to be zero @xmath0 and the energy of the three - point one loop feynman graph of fermions, gauge and ghost bosons must be so low that even the non - abelian gauge theories and the quark confinement and deconfinement are considered as the underlying quantum field theories. in the meanwhile, the so - called cut - off terms which are part of the loop graphs will be retained. this assures that the theories described by the lagrangian and by the nambu - jona - lasinio model will be renormalizable and thus would provide the gauge invariance and the generalized ward identities at one - loop level. among other regularized loop graphs, we present the explicit evaluation for the hadronic matrix elements in the kaon decay. in a detailed evaluation, the cases of quadratically divergent ilis and complete antisymmetric tensor type ilis are explicitly evaluated. though the general case of three loop graphs is analyzed, the details are slightly simpler. a general procedure for the evaluation of any fold ilis is presented here. it is found that the general scheme can be applied to a wide variety of qfts ( such as qcd and effective theories ) and the cases include yang - mills gauge theories, the chiral, topological and supersymmetric theories. as an example, we evaluate the vacuum polarization diagrams of gauge bosons at sufficiently low energy scale in the context of the effective theory. conformal symmetry remains a central issue in all these cases.
the polariton dispersion of a microcavity resonator driven by parametric fluctuations in the pump is investigated under the hypothesis that the polariton population is bistable. a state in which only a single, pumped, single polariton mode is populated is found, and criteria are obtained for determining whether a simple bistability results, or the opo state switches on. in the case of the simple state, the no - turning - on criterion is derived. these criteria are then used to determine the upper limit of the pump - turn - on threshold below which it is not possible to turn on. the results of the stability analysis for the simple opo states are compared with those obtained for the more complex signal and idler states. it is well known that the non - linearity of the renormalisation of polariton populations causes them to fluctuate. when this fluctuation is sufficiently small, a state with two independent parameters to be stable has been observed, that is, no polaritons on the upper branch of the spectral curve ( s - curve ) @xcite. these states have been described theoretically in terms of a system of coupled equations, from which the dispersion is obtained, and have been observed as amplitudes for the signal, as well as idler, modes. in this paper, new dispersion states are introduced which are stable for a given pump angle and energy, and which have the same properties as the simple parametric state. these new states have their properties of being unstable for high pump powers, and exhibiting behaviour which is similar to parametric luminescence, for example. the purpose of this paper is to explore the instability of the photoproduction state, and determine whether it can be switched on or not. ultrafast, ultra - high - power pulsed - probe experiments provide a measure of stability of these states, which can not be described by a single parameter@xcite, and it is interesting to ask whether these experiments can distinguish between the parametric and non - parametric behaviour. for example, ultrafast scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has observed that the pump component always shows a blue - shift of the probe intensity, while ultrafast charge - coupled oscillation - probe ( ccd ) experiments have observed parametric oscillations in which the pump plus ccd appear to be blue - shifted. the important question of whether the coherent oscillation or not is the cause of this unexpected behaviour, and whether it is possible to control it by changing the pump
we experimentally investigate entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements of spin-1 electron spin of a nitrogen - vacancy center ( nv center ) under an external magnetic field. different from conventional used optical systems, our system is a truly three - level system which has overcome the defects of post - selection. the significance of this experiment shows that the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics can be more precisely formulated and demonstrated for a high - dimension quantum system. more importantly, our result may shed new light on the differences between quantum and classical physics in higher - dimension. + * several systems in nature are known to be nonlocality bound. among them, solid state systems and semiconductor devices are well studied and almost degenerate in electron spin number. uncertainty relations characterizing the interplay of electron spin and nuclear spins has received much attention. they have been extensively used in nuclear physics @xcite and have been studied in the context of spin - orbit interaction for both solid - state as well as quantum - mechanical systems. currently, the uncertainty relations being used in quantum physics are based on the superposition principle in the relativistic formalism. they are due to the fact that states other than the initial state are randomly split in the quantum mechanical system. in the classical theory, only the minimum sum of entropies for the measurements expressed in the fluctuation - dissipation relation can be obtained. however, due to various decoherence of center electron spin during the controls and measurements, the von neumann uncertainty has to be taken into account. several uncertainty relations have been calculated for different systems and experimental setups. here, we report the first room - temperature implementation of them for the spin - 1 electron spin measurement in a three - dimensional solid state system. + the experiment is implemented with a single nvcenter in pure diamond. the electrostatic repulsion of nv centers is used to drive electron spin polarization. a permanent magnet is applied to the system and qualitatively tuned the polarization. our system has been extensively studied and the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretic predictions. + state tomography is one of the most essential techniques for the experimental implementation of quantum experiments. for example, for an optical system optically trapped electrons are measured by means of a scanning confocal microscope combined with integrated microwave devices ( mw ). in this experiment, mw@xmath0 and @xmath1 are measured two and two - dimensional respectively. then after a 532 nm laser pulse, projection of the result is carried out by mw
we have studied the hard x - ray characteristics of 4u 2206 + 54 with the integral / ibis observations from 2003 may to 2005 december. in quiescent states, we found two modulation periods of 9.56 days and 19.11 days ; both of them could be due to the neutron star passing through the equatorial plane of the mass donor. then with the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board rxte, we searched for a pulsation period during 2004 may, but only found a marginal detection at @xmath0 day. on the other hand, in active states, there exists a correlation between the orbit period and the pulse correlation time, which also suggests an orbit period correlated with pulse amplitude. if the 19.2-day period is not the real orbit period, there should be two outbursts from 2004 to 2005. in addition, four cyclotron resonant absorption lines were detected during the active state, but no corresponding pulsation line is found in the asm data. we have also re - analyzed the archival data of the system with the ibis in the energy range of 20 60 kev. finally, we confirm the existence of the possible orbit periods reported by the early asm and swift / bat observations.

we investigate the formation of molecular gas in plane - parallel shocks starting with atomic gas. our model incorporates all the relevant heating and cooling mechanisms appropriate for the interstellar medium, including chemical processes relevant to the transformation of atomic gas to molecular form. we explore a range of shock velocities comparable to the flows expected in the diffuse atomic medium ; the parameter ranges are also appropriate for models in which gmc formation is induced by galactic spiral density waves or energetic supernova. the post - shock evolution shows a sharp spike which is due to rapid co formation from the pre - existing h@xmath0. in the standard model cloud formation would appear in front of the spiral shock wave as traced by the radio continuum emission. by tracking the evolution of the gas temperature and extinction, we find that a shock with ram pressure @xmath1 can successfully form a molecular cloud. the typical pre - shock gas temperature, after cooling, declines in a linear fashion, except for the strongest shock, due to the lack of atomic carbon cooling. the molecular cooling depends on the magnetic field, which is defined by the ratio of magnetic pressure to kinetic pressure. in our model clouds appear as molecular when the column density is high enough to shield the molecular gas from the dissociating effects of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ). when the isrf is suppressed the cloud properties change in a way that is similar to the case for co in the local interstellar medium ( lmc ). we show that a time dependent shielding reduces the influence of c i on the chemistry, and suggests that this effect is the same in the galaxy and may be important in forming stars there. we provide an analytical solution for the chain of molecular formation processes behind a shock. the solution includes all the required chemical processes and only two free parameters. for the efficient application of the code we examine the accumulation timescale and the timescale for co to rise. these results place significant constraints on the mechanism(s ) of cloud formation.
we show that the recent determination of the geometry - corrected prompt energy release ( @xmath0-ray energy ) in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can serve to refine the standard candle grb energetics towards a more standardized candle, thus permitting grb cosmography to operate optimally over the largest range of redshifts yet probed with a consistent set of data. we demonstrate that the ghirlanda relation, recently discovered for the first time, provides a physical relationship between the total beaming - corrected grb isotropic - equivalent energy and the rest - frame prompt burst energy, which can be computed differently between jet models. while the physical motivation for a standard energy release is plausible, the geometry correction of the energy is highly model dependent, requiring an inference of the nature of the circumburst environment and assumptions about the structure of the jet. as such, grbs prove to be ideal standardizers for testing cosmological models. if grb progenitors are massive wolf - rayet type stars, as in the popular collapsar model or hypernova model, one naturally expects at least some bursts to go off in the presence of a wind - blown environment ( wind ), where the radial density profile varies as the inverse square of the radial distance, leading to significant systematic uncertainties in the inferred radii. if, instead, grb astrophysical models are truly jet - dominated, an improved treatment of the potential systematic errors inherent in the deduced standard candle would mitigate the need for a detailed modeling of the grb energy distribution. with an expanded sample of 29 grbs with well - constrained densities ( and efficiencies ) and a fixed ratio of the matter density to the light - travel - time, a grb standard candle with hubble - time measurement could be constructed within the next decade. such a uniform energy distribution is not yet feasible, due to the rapidly increasing number of high - redshift, high - efficiency sne ia which are currently detectable with _ swift _ but not necessarily when _ jwst _ launches its _ snap _ satellite. we conclude that with accurate data from upcoming satellites and with grb detection rates at about one end of the cosmographic standard candle, there remains the possibility of deriving important information on the evolution of the universe from the zero - point of the hubble diagram at epochs of reionization.
the four hot r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars v348 sgr, hv 2671, mv sgr and dy cen show large random declines in brightness over the last @xmath0 100 years. as such, they have been given the collective classification of ` ` post - agb '' stars. in this paper, we compare the observed properties of these stars with the properties of the cooler rcb stars known in the literature. except for the lmc hot rcb star hv2671, we adopt their value of @xcite ( 0.45 @xfig1 0.1 ) mag. the planetary nebula ( pn ) expansion velocity is low, ( 12.5 r@xmath3 ), and the electron density is very low, around half the value for a pn of this spectral type. in addition, the stellar atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen and helium, unlike the case of classical be stars. the metallicity is close to solar, but the abundance discrepancy is much larger than can be explained by the uncertainties in the helium abundance. we show that the _ abundance variability _ observed during light declines is not the result of the decrease in the brightness, but of a change in the maximum - light spectrum which occurs randomly between two different epochs. of the four stars, two show spectral splits of he i and c ii. these splits are very similar and might be the same as those of the three born - again stars, were it not contaminated by nebular emission. however, their h - deficiency is large and the derived radius is much smaller than those of a typical b - type main sequence star. we suggest that the stars studied here are all members of the young rcb class. while the p - cygni components of the emission lines of v 348 sgr ( and, to a lesser extent, v 2671 ) are strongly asymmetric, their radial velocities are consistent with a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ), which would explain their helium - rich surface layers. nevertheless, the non - detection of hydrogen in these two stars, if their distance is not restricted to the local group, raises the question of whether the stars are evolving through the younger rcb / wd - merger scenario or more rapidly.
the andromeda galaxy m32 has several properties that are similar to those of andromeda s closest stellar companion, but are otherwise very different. its high surface brightness, its proximity, the availability of stellar photometry in the outer parts of the galaxy, and its near - solar abundance ratios make m32 an excellent laboratory for testing stellar population theory and honing integrated light models. here i summarize ground - based and space - based long - slit spectroscopy for m32, including observations made with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ). the hst stis data provide a spectral resolution of 1, which is sufficient for the measurement of lick / ids indices at 1.8, 1.5, and 2.3 @xmath0(pa ) from the nucleus, the two regions where most spectral indices have been measured, and for the most accurate determination of the abundance ratios so far based on _ hst _ data. the good agreement between stellar population models and the actual spectral measurements makes m32 a good example of a well - mixed system. indices affected by light elements n, c, and na are summarized, while those affected by nitrogen ( mainly na d ) are sparsely sampled. the best - fit models have an age of 8 gyr and a dispersion of 0.2 dex in mg, along with [ mg / fe ] between 1 and 3 dex. the abundance ratio m / l@xmath1 is essentially unchanged from nucleus to nucleus, except in the inner few parsecs, and increases by almost an order of magnitude in radius. this suggests that the age increases with radius except at the nucleus. there is no clear indication of gradient in this region of the light profile other than a break in the surface brightness. other age indicators of the stellar population, such as cn, cme, and hn, are also consistent with the adopted abundance pattern. the existence of a central black hole may help to explain the relative lack of gradients observed in the nuclear regions of m32. but the data can not match the expectation that the nuclear region should be a distinct subgalaxy from the overall abundance gradient. # 1to 0pt#1 [ firstpage ] galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : individual : m32 galaxies : ism galaxies : stellar content
the force exerted on a charged particle by an aharonov - bohm flux line is derived from kinematics. the derivation does not require the solution of the schrdinger equation. it is straightforward to generalize to the case of more than one flux line. the lorentz force, on the other hand, is expressed, formally, in terms of the commutator of components of kinetic momentum. as a consequence, it is invariant under the gauge transformation. the expressions for the force operator, and its matrix elements between stationary states of the same energy, coincide with previous results. the transverse component of the force is shown to coincide with shelankov s formula in the paraxial limit. pointing out that the nominal magnetic field operator, @xmath0, is incompatible with gauge invariance, we show that a modification of the canonical commutation relations, restored to the standard formulation, does not transform correctly under gauge transformations and must be modified. the leading - order expectation value of the impulse value for two kinds of wavepackets, which is computed as a linear combination of hilbert s integral and its expectation value for smooth wavefunctions. for slow wavespackets ( ), which spread more quickly than they move, the impulse is inversely proportional to the initial distance between the wavepacket and the flux line, with magnitude and direction depending periodically on the flux parameter, @xcite. for fast wavepackete ( ) moving rapidly than they spread, we obtain an expression for the scattering cross - section which, surprisingly, coincides with the exact result. for inertial waves ( ) the expectation value is smaller, but not by as large a factor as might be expected. in cylindrical tubes, we compute expectation values for a class of wavetransverse waves which have weak but non - zero transverse fluctuations, similar to our examples for superconducting or ferromagnetic tubes. the comparison of our results with those obtained in the literature is a further demonstration of the accuracy of our analysis.
we investigate the use of high multiplex fibre - optic systems for accurate sky subtraction of astronomical spectra with the aim of demonstrating that these stalwart multi - object systems provide excellent spectral quality over long duration exposures. we use the aaomega system at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) to demonstrate that a principle components analysis ( pca ) can provide sky - subtraction performance comparable to the best currently available dedicated sky - fibre techniques. we report that the pca technique is superior to nod - and - shuffle based techniques for moderate signal - to - noise narrow - band spectroscopy, with a demonstrated ability to significantly reduce systematic errors, while maintaining sensitivity at the same time. for the gama project we demonstrate that pca provides excellent performance over a decade in terms of reducing sky error rates and improving sky quality, with respect to the traditional dedicated sky fibre method. we also discuss the impact of a mode of observation which employs a high level of automation such as target multiplexing to remove scattered light from science and calibration frames, previously used in the n+s and 2df systems. to demonstrate the potential of this approach we use a number of example high - quality fibre spectra from the wigglez dark energy project and gemini deep deep surveys to illustrate the potential for use with pca. # 1 # 1@xmath0 # 1#1 # 1to 0pt#1 = = = -0.5 cm = -1.0 cm [ firstpage ] instrumentation : spectrograph and calibration stars : distances and redshifts survey galaxies : distances localmology : observations methods : astronomical data [ cols="<,>",options="header ", ] + a&a,#1 eqnnum,#2eqncrab,#2q_0 terms & numbers : 11.10.+s, 11.20.gv, 12 12.38.bx, 12.30.gx, 03.70.+e, # 1eqn(#1 ) & ( [ # 2 ] ) # 1table [ t:#1 ] # 1fig.

the tw diatomic molecular potential has been studied within the framework of relativistic klein - gordon and dirac equations by means of three eigensolution approaches : finite amplitude approximation ( faa ), exact quantization rule ( susyqm ) and an improved version of the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ). in all cases, the solution of the schrdinger equation is obtained from the properties of generalized hypergeometric functions. aiming to solve the nonrelativistic equations with the help of the fisher information is proposed as well. furthermore, the probability distributions of diatomic molecules in excited rotational- and vibrational states are obtained by performing information measures of a probability distribution called as the fisher s information entropy. the information measures are used to determine uncertainty or information content of several functions of the density, which are defined as the normalized - to - unity ( probability ) density @xmath0 and the shannon entropy. using these information measures, the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the potential are obtained. it is shown that the effective bohr - sommerfeld potential yields the same results for the bound - state spectra as the faa and the aim approaches. however, the uncertainty in the density is much larger than that of the theory and the method can not be used to characterize the quantum mechanical solutions of the equation of form ( [ e1 ] ). the method which is proposed to find the exact solutions is based on the assumption that the potential is an intermolecular potential. this model provides the spinless pion and the effective strong interaction potential. in this model, the possibility of identifying positive energy solution for spin symmetry arises due to the presence of an additional parameter, which is not accounted for in the traditional solution. the positive energy solutions can be obtained from those of pseudospin symmetry. finally, the equation which gives the most negative energy solution is obtained by using the appropriate transformation of the central coordinate of fisher information. the interesting fact that the solution obtained can be used in the calculation of intramolecular forces in molecules is also discussed.
we investigate the transmission of a bose - einstein condensate with a uniform density profile across a periodic optical lattice by means of a confining pair of far - off resonant laser pulses. the synchrotron radiation of a single quasi - bound mode is considered and the effects of the interactions among the atoms inside the lattice are taken into account. we find that the transmitted pulse is strongly distorted in the presence of interaction : its amplitude saturates for incident intensities much larger than the one in the incident wave packet and its shape can be reversed from that of the free - space value obtained in the single - mode case. we also predict optical bistability effects which are a consequence of the positive feedback produced by the interactions. the study of the wave propagation in condensed matter has a long history. important effects include confinement by periodic dielectric crystals @xcite, the red shift of the laser beam waist caused by the refraction of the optical ring and the splittings of the atom cloud s bloch schwinger eigenfunction due to the confining potential @xmath0 @xcitons. the controlled confining of an optical or magnetic field has also been considered in the past and shown to give rise to certain interesting phenomena such as the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) effect @xcire and the mott - znajek - kosterlitz - thouless ( mw ) cas a manifestation of optical nonlinearity in the form of a modulated bloch - edge bloch wavefunction, and the cas parameterization of dark soliton - like states in the optical band gap crystal lattice near the optical bragg transition @xcition. in this paper, we extend these studies for a more realistic situation in which the atoms in the cloud are not static but can actually move around in a quasi - one - dimensional cylindrical lattice. such situations have been recently realized in several condensed - matter systems and are usually described by the gross - pitaevskii equation or gpa. the growth of condensates in such lattices has been recently predicted by the method of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the framework of the 3d mw approximation @xciting. at the same time, the dynamics of the condensed atomic cloud in a 1d quasi - 1d lattice has been shown to be strongly affected by nonlinear effects, being able to induce a significant reshaping of the density profile of the cloud. in
the sun is a variable star with an 11-year cyclic cycle. its oscillation frequencies show an anti - correlation with solar activity, which is theoretically understood to be driven by a dynamo process located at the bottom of the convective zone. other spectral indicators of magnetic activity such as the ca ii h and k emission lines and the 10.7-cm radio flux for instance show also a frequency shift in the p - mode frequencies, indicating the presence of a similar dynamo mechanism. however, signals of a short activity cycle in the sun were detected only recently by the corot satellite. here we report on the recent discovery of long - term variations of the p- mode frequency shifts in the solar - like f5v star hd 49933 with magnetic activity. preliminary spectroscopic measurements with of the eta / smarts 1.5-m telescope at ctio have shown that the activity cycle is short ( @xmath0 days ) and that the emission lines are consistent with a single - sided rotational cycle. with the discovery of the new cycle 24, this completes the set of results on the sun s magnetic activity which has a period of about 1.6 years and is the first solar - type star for which spectropolarimetric measurements are available. it will provide for the first time high - quality constraints to the theory of stellar magnetic activity in a wide variety of stars, thereby establishing it as a crucial tool for the study of the physical processes involved in the dynamo processes in stars hotter and more evolved than the sun. improved measurements of stellar activity by corot will contribute to determine more accurately the period and the properties of this magnetic activity cycle. asteroseismology, which provides for instance insights into the internal structure and dynamics of the stars, will improve our understanding of the complex solar magnetism. moreover, the complete sample of corot magnetograms now available includes most of the f8v stars hd 181420, hd 49385, and hd 52265, which belong to the young active sequence of main - sequence stars. improved observations from the nasa / esa hubble space telescope and the space telescope science institute will expand the number of well - studied stars with well - defined activity cycles to several dozen or more stars and make it possible to explore the physics of stellar magnetism in detail.
the palatini formulation of higher - order and scalar - tensor theories of gravity shows the relations between the metric structure of spacetime and the physical properties of the scalar fields. as a consequence, the standard hilbert - einstein theory can be reduced to a reduced model of gravity by giving the new metric via the conformal transformation. this new metric is related, in the case of @xmath0-scalar fields, to the connection corresponding to the minimal coupling of the theory. in this paper, we address the issues of cosmological models and of the relationship between the various conformal transformations discussed in the paper and their properties. special attention is paid to the problems connected with the astrophysical observations. it is demonstrated that, after the survey of standard cosmology, it is not possible to pronounce a universally valid notion of past, present and future ( i.e. that the universe can not be considered as a static entity ). furthermore, we show that the problem of formulating a coherent quantum theory of gravitation or of quantum spacetime can be treated as a low - energy limit of string theories. as an example, we discuss the formulation of the brans - dicke theory, which takes into account a non - minimally coupled gravitational coupling, without taking into account huge amounts of dark matter. epsf.tex # 1#2#3acta. phys. pol. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) [ 3]phys. rev. lett. * # 1*, # 3 ( # 2 ) ( # 1,#2,#3 ) [ 5]#1_#2 # 1(#1 ) _ = # 1;#2;#3;#4;#5 # 1 # 2, in _ # 3 _, ed. # 4 ( # 5 : # 2 ; # 3, # 4, # 5 ) # 1;;#2;;#3;;#4 ; # 1. _ # 2 _, p#3 ( # 4 ) # 5 # 1 ; # 2. _ ` ` # 1.5 '' # 1?? # 2? # 3? # 4? # 5? # 6? # 7? # 8? # 9? # 10. _ key words _ : general relativity, general relativity - cosmology - large - scale structure of the universe - curved geometry
the focus of high - contrast imaging is to search for earth - like planets surrounding their host stars. the current generation of instruments dedicated to direct imaging ( sphere ), gpi, and spitzer are all based on the coronagraphic imaging technique, which is able to achieve a nanometric contrast of @xmath0 on a point source. to reach the ultimate performance of the instrument, one must be able to compensate for high - order aberrations, which originate in any imperfections of the optical system such as misalignment or optical surface polishing error. to this end, we propose a compensation method, called coffee ( for coronagraphographic focal - plane wave - front estimation for exoplanet detection ), based on a maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) approach : it estimates the longitudinal and transverse ( perpendicular to the incident point - spread function ) bi - aliasing errors, as well as the fluxes, without any aberration assumptions. previous studies of coffee s performance demonstrated that the use of a truncated zernike basis for the reconstruction led to a strong aliasing error, let alone the inability to estimate high frequency events. in this paper, we present a series of modifications that allows coffee to overcome its previous limitations. in particular, we introduce a method of energy minimization in the detector plane that allows the creation of a dark hole without any small aberration assumption. unlike other compensation methods we propose, the one we propose does not rely on the calibration of an interaction matrix used to determine the position of the image on the detector. moreover, we show that a suitable diversity phase for coffee is not required to achieve nanometric precision, so that it can be used as a regularization metric for the phase reconstruction, using existing and newly developed regularization metrics. 10 a. bocquillon, ed., _ planetary systems in astronomy _ ( university of warwick, uk, 2003 ). m. w. eberly, ` ` direct imaging of exoplanets, '' in _ proceedings of the international conference on planets and satellites in the solar system _, ( wiley - vch, berlin, 2008 ), pp. 7578. d. a. pfeiffer and d. c. wieman, _ optical astronomy : the measurement of planetary atmospheres _ ( academic, new york, 1993 ). l. york university, nasa gsfc, greenbelt, md 20742, usa. a. m. marino, r
we present a deep tensor neural network ( dtnn ) that enables the visual understanding of quantum - chemical phenomena by developing a model for molecular dynamics trajectories that combines atomic and molecular statistical physics principles for both compositional and configurational degrees of freedom in the vast chemical space. to demonstrate the utility of the proposed deep neural network, we simulated accurate energies of benzene, toluene, malonaldehyde and salicylic acid, which are all molecules with up to 9 heavy atoms out of 73,000 molecules with more than 20 atoms trained on both gdb and gdb-13 ( 80 % and 25 % ) time sets, respectively. compared to previously employed molecular dynamics ( md ) reference models, the effectiveness and generality of the new model is demonstrated by demonstrating predictability with a mean absolute error of 0.04@xmath00.02 kcal / mol and a 90 % confidence level estimate of 1.0 kcal /mol, both of which are comparable to the accuracy of previously employed md reference models. the ability to predict individual molecular properties such as electron, frequency, bond and frequency distributions, as well as local molecular chemical potentials and relative isomer energies, paves the way to the development of a universal machine learning model that will enable the visual exploration and learning of molecular properties beyond what can be achieved with only a few steps. = 1 a wide range of physical, chemical and biological systems are known to be able to self - organize in complex quantum systems @xcite. while only encompassing conformations of a single molecule, the electronic structure of a molecule can be computed with great accuracy due to quantum - mechanical phenomena such as superconductivity or charge transfer. however, determining the properties of molecular systems is a particularly challenging task, a fact that has to be solved in a systematic and data - driven manner. in the field of quantum chemistry because of the interplay between quantum and classical physics. for example, the isomer energy predictions of molecules are subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, which determine not only the structure and behavior of molecular molecules, but also their electronic and optical properties. the challenge to overcome this difficulty lies in extracting useful information from the molecular data, a task that is far less well - established than that of molecular structural studies. although assembly of a molecular representation is an important task, the construction of a reliable mathematical model is a yet - to - be - achieved task, owing to the difficulty in visualizing and understanding physical phenomena in molecules, especially those that have been exposed
we investigate the possibility of generating hyperchaos by coupling two hyperchaotic attractors corresponding to two seperate scaling regions of differing length scales, say, @xmath0 and @xfig. we show that there is a possibility that the underlying attractor may become a superposition of two multifractal sets with different topological dimension. in the present case, the two scaling regions may be considered as two inter - scale regions resulting in a cantor set that displays a two hump curve with two superimposed component sets. we find that, to characterize the structure of such a set, it is useful to write the fractal dimension of the attractor as a function of the inverse radius of the system. using a simple example for the distribution of galaxies in the observable universe, we show numerically that a set of points in the 2-sigma box counting plane can be represented by a dual hyperchotic attractor where the second hump curve corresponds to the smaller of the two components. we further show that the resulting set is a geometric construction of a fractal set which can be used to detect the transition to hyper chaos in two different range of scales, corresponding to intra cluster and inter - cluster scaling. this set and the related multi - scale fractal spectrum can be utilized as a diagnostic tool to discriminate between the chaotic and high dimensional dynamics in the real world. finally, we provide a detailed numerical study of the importance of multiscale multifractality in real world systems and show that it is possible to get a much more detailed information regarding the topological structure of the hyperchosis attractor by varying the coupling strength. * the hyperchaosis of high dimensional attractors * + * i.m. dremin@xmath1, h.j. de vegni@xcite and w.b. rajagopadhyay @xcite + * key words : * cosmology, dynamics, fractal analysis, large - scale structure, complex systems, time series, hydrodynamics, large scale structure in the universe, galaxies : statistics, methods : n - body simulations * * abstract *
we model the gas temperature and molecular line emission that is expected to result from unstable c - type shocks, given the ion and neutral velocity fields computed in a companion paper by stone ( 1997 ). we use numerical simulations of the wardle instability carried out with a new computer code, zeus-2f, that has been tested extensively in a variety of applications. two- and three - dimensional simulations are carried out for shocks in which the preshock magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock propagation direction,, and in cases where the pre - shock velocity is in the range typically encountered in star forming regions. for all three cases that we have considered, the shock - excited line emission arises from shocks that are initially plane - parallel and that propagate in an initially homogeneous medium. we obtain results for the distribution of the gas temperatures in the shocked region and for the line emissions that arise from shocks of neutral alfvenic mach number 10 and velocity 20 or @xmath0. the temperature distributions were obtained for three different shock cases : ( 1 ) in the case where the shocks are viewed along the plane of the sky, but along the line of sight ; ( 2 ) for shocks where the line - emitting regions are elongated with the flow, such that downstream regions of the shock are patchy, but spatially continuous ; and ( 3 ) for which the line emission originates upstream of the region where the instability has reached saturation. overall, none of the results of the simulations applies to all of these cases. the difference between the temperature distribution obtained from the simulated gas temperature structure in the initial state and that predicted by kn96 ( which was used for the computation of the predicted fluxes for far - infrared co lines ) is significantly smaller than the observed one. these results provide a justification for the use of one - dimensional steady shock models for the generation of shock - excitation line spectra in the interpretation of observations of warm molecular gas. the results also provide a possible explanation for the difference in the predicted luminosities of the ( warm ) water maser emission observed between two and three shapshots of the second shapshot.
we present high - sensitivity, multi - epoch vla @xmath0 mm continuum observations of the radio sources in the orion bn / kl star - forming region. these observations have revealed that the radio emission from source i is elongated nw - se and is stable over a decade ; the morphology and the stability of the emission is consistent with an ionized edge - on disk. we have measured the proper motions of source i and the bn object for the first time at 43 ghz and find that they are moving with high speeds ( 12 and 26 km s@xmath1, respectively ) approximately in opposite directions with respect to each other. we discuss possible dynamical scenarios that can explain the anomalously large motions of bn and source i, based on proper motion measurements. we suggest that source i was a binary system before the close passage with bn, which possibly truncated the original circumbinary disk ( at least until 500 years ago ). inference that this is the natal accretion disk is in agreement with disk - mediated accretion for source i. based on new n - body simulations of decaying protostellar clusters with a varying number of objects, we argue that the probability of ejecting massive members ( i.e., binaries with total masses of 11 - 36 m@x0 ) from the system is very low ( @xunder 99 % ). however, the presence of a massive disk around source i could contribute to the rapid rotation of the disk, and may lead to the formation of a second massive component, or to the disruption of the binary system. the dynamical interactions among three objects in a bound system, revealed in radio and infrared studies, can not be explained by a simple ejected - binary scenario. on the other hand, the separation among binary components, averaged over the last 50 years, appears to be consistent with the ejection of one member ( source i ) and the loss of another member as a result of the encounter. we propose that the original bound cluster may have suffered a multiple - body interaction resulting in the expansion of multiple objects with different velocities and the recoil of one ( or more ) of the protostars as tight binaries. the origin of the loose loose fragments in the loose systems remains unclear. a detailed dynamical analysis of the mass dynamics in loose systems will be required before a firm conclusion can be made on this issue. in the meantime, we have performed a series of detailed 3-body simulations of dynamical decoupling of prot
we consider the implications of the recent result by mecozzi and bellini @xcite indicating possible superluminal propagation of neutrinos at finite distances and energies. we also make a realistic analysis of the effect of three neutrino flavour mixing on group velocity using the wave packet formalism. we show that there is a narrow region of the allowed parameter space with realistic values for the mixing angles and mass squared differences. this allows us to consider the limit of finite wave packets of finite width. as a result, for short base - line propagation and for long oscillation periods ( e.g., within the interval permitted by the latest data of the opera experiment ), there is an enhancement of the group velocity with respect to the standard oscillation frame work. further studies along the same lines are required in order to understand whether this result can be understood within the usual framework of physics. # 1#2#3 _ nucl. phys. _ * b#1 *, # 2 ( 19#3 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 phys. lett. * # 1 *, l#2(19#3)#3 # 1 = cmr10 scaled 1 to 0pt#1#2 # 3 # 1 european laboratory for particle physics cern - ep/99 - 009 + 28th january 1999 ( submitted to z. phys. c ) the opera collaboration g.abbiendi@xmath0, c.ainsley,3 p.f.kesson,2 g.alexander,4 g.j.allison,7 s.arcelli,9 r.asai,9 d.axen,10 g.azuelos,9 i.bailey,9 a.h.ball,11 e.barberio,9 f.cappella,9 s.baumann,9 j.bechtluft,9 p.bechtle,9 t.behnke,9 k.w.bell,7 a.bellerive,7 g.benelli,8 s.bethke,8 o.biebel,8 p.bock,8 a.biguzzi,7 p.d.bird,9 v.blobel,6 p.o.boutemeur,6 s.braibant,5 m. bertolucci,5 l.brigliadori,5 r.m.brown,5 s.burck
we investigate the x - ray properties of the agns selected in the subaru _ xmm - newton _ deep survey ( sxds ) field using deep multi - wavelength imaging observations covering the far - ultraviolet to mid - infrared and deep optical and near - infrared multi - object spectroscopic observations. the imaging observations were conducted with the suprime - cam camera on the prime - focus of the 8.2 m subaru telescope. the part of the survey region, covering a 1.3 deg@xmath0 area, is also covered by a deep imaging data obtained with the mosaic - ii camera attached to the ctio blanco 4 m telescope. among the @xmath1-band selected agns, 90 % have a counterpart brighter than 26.4 or 26.6 mag ( @xma0-band ) and distance greater than 3.6 kpc, respectively. we construct a catalog of 250 x -ray sources brighter than 22.8 or 27.3 mag ( ab magnitude system ) in the 0.52.0 kev band by applying sextractor. the optical counterpart candidates are identified using rest - frame uv, optical, mid - ir, and radio fluxes ; the fraction of the sources with 1.6, nuv, and long - slit sources is 43 %. we find that the optical spectra of the majority of the candidates are fitted well with a simple power - law model with a photon index of 1.82 and an asymptotic broad - line component at 2.2 kev. there are 945 multi - band sources in the total sample ; 745 of them are associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) detected in the optical vla survey while the remaining 300 sources are consistent with serendipitously discovered agns. assuming the luminosity function of agns as a function of redshift, the results are in good agreement with the results of x- and nir surveys covering similar regions and luminosities. we conduct monte - carlo simulations of the optical identification process using the multi - source catalog to estimate the reliability and the number of mis - identifications. mis - identified agns in the deep optical source catalogs account for the estimated extinction of the radio source population. the estimated mis - identification rates are in the range of 10 % to 40 %.
in the context of permutation pattern matching ( ppm ), the complexity of determining, for a pair of permutations @xmath0 and a text whose elements have the same relative order as the permutations of a given pair, called the _ permutation class _, whether the resulting permutation is contained in the text is known to be a subset of the _ pattern _, i.e., the set of all permutations compatible with the text. a key result of this paper is that ppm can be solved in polynomial time. to this end, we consider two instances of ppm where the inputs are restricted to a particular properpermutation class, and we combine a classical theorem of ahal and rabinovich ( 1996 ) to prove that ppm is np - complete, or in other words, that the problem is solvable by a brute - force algorithm. this is the first algorithmic proof of a np - hardness result for ppm. we also adapt this result and adapt it to patterns with bounded ` ` ` treewidths '. we call these the _ proper permutation classes _ by bose, buss and lubiw ( 2002 ), and by veta_polynomialni_skew _ by lubitz and rubin ( 2007 ). the problem of ppm is often referred to as _ percolation _ in the literature, because it is equivalent to the _ collection problem _ of finite - odd permutations. a permutation ( or permutation tree _ ) is a line segment of integers, or more precisely, a subroutine that divides the complement of the permutation set by the collection of finite elements. the object of a _ collection of integers _ is called a _ spiral moduli _, and its solution is known as a _ block diagram_. lines of text elements are line shapes, and pairs of integers are called _ circles_. the elements of a line are lines, and no more than two elements are contained in each line. a line may have additional uses : for instance, lines may have multiple uses, and the combined length of the lines may be multiplexed. non - line - like structures of high complexity can be used to construct ` ` spiral trees '' or ` ` spirals ''. the study of these structures has a long history. early attempts to analyze the fractal complexity of ppm have been motivated by the problems posed by lee and miller ( 1989 ) and by vatter ( 1990 ). following a recent survey by
we present a deep optical spectroscopic survey of the ` extremely red galaxies'( ergs ) in the chandra / goods deep field south, combining data from the european southern observatories ( eso ) great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ). from a sample of 198 ergs, we have secure or probable redshifts, and use the 7-band near - infrared photometry of these galaxies to derive photometric redshift estimates, which in turn are used to estimate stellar masses and luminosity functions. we find that @xmath0 per cent of the ergs have a prominent [ oii]@xmath1 emission line, while only few have a significant [ orival ] emission line. by fitting simple spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to our erg spectra we can estimate the luminosity, metallicity, and star - formation rate ( sfr ) of the entire sample of ergs. fibre - resolved spectra, combined with our knowledge of the local extragalactic background, allow us to determine the mean ages of the galaxies in the sample to be between 21.5 and 25.0 gyr. combining this with the star formation rates determined from the rest - frame uv continuum galaxy sfrs, we estimate that the stellar populations of the majority of our ergs were already in place at epochs earlier than our own. we separate the redshift - selected sample into two sub - samples, based on the presence of radio sources, and examine the distribution of the erg morphologies as a function of optical / near - ir redshift. out of the 16 ergs for which we have probable or significant redshift, only 4 show morphological evidence of recent star formation, while most of the rest show evidence of ongoing star formation. for the three populations which are dominated by starbursts, we find evidence for old and massive star - forming galaxies, and for mergers of previously red, massive galaxies, which are younger than the present day e / s0 population. we conclude that our results point to a high degree of regularity and/or burst activity among the most massive galaxies on the cdfs.

collective behavior in a group of self - propelled walkers or spinners is a widespread phenomenon in nature, cutting through a variety of socio - economic and social systems. in recent years, we have witnessed a growing interest in using non - cooperative robots to model face - to - face interactions with each other and to control their motion, with the aim of better understanding the cooperative behavior and the dependence of the system size on the individual s behavior. here, we demonstrate that using simple vertical arrangements of plastic bristles as building blocks we can control the motion of individual bluebots ( bbots ). to this end, we perform a series of experiments in which we observe disordered and stasis, i.e. random motion of bbots confined by an arena with a soft and hard boundary, respectively. we show that the combination of shape dependent contact interactions and confinement induce behaviors typical of walkers, leading to an increase in the ability of the bbots to adjust their orientation relative to the boundary and a decrease in their interaction with the system. furthermore, we observe that an individual bbot confined to a hard boundary moves along a straight line in the direction of the boundary, while a bending and unbending of the bristles cause them to move in a circle. we explain these results via a detailed modeling of the geometric structure of the space of bristles. we also present an experimental example where the collective behavior is influenced by the backbending of a bristle. our results highlight the importance of collective behavior in controlling the behavior of bbot groups, and how it can help explain the formation of large groups of dynamical systems with broken spatial order. walkers and spinners are micro - organisms that are able to adapt their motion to locales due to a combination of forward - inspiral and sideways spinning motion. the resulting collective dynamics of these microorganisms have a profound effect on the organization of walksers, in particular their ability to cooperate for walks on a fine - grained surfaces, and to shape - twist and align themselves with other individuals by means of eye motions and small jumps. while it has been years since the days of bavis and wallley - crick ( bflo ) when they were able to move freely in aisymmetrized parabolic motion in a two - dimensional cylindrical environment, since their pioneering work was in the early 1990 s. at that time, it was clear that interacting with bbots was important for them to learn how to see each other s interactions and to form social networks.
we study the localization of classical waves in one - dimensional disordered structures composed of alternating layers of left- and right - handed materials ( m - stacks ). we compare the transport properties of these systems to those of homogeneous systems composed of different layers of the same material, h - stacks. for weakly scattering layers and general disorder, we develop an effective analytical approach which allows us to calculate the transmission length over a wide range of input parameters and to describe transmission through m- and h - stack structures in a unified way. all theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the results of extensive numerical simulations. there are remarkable distinctions between the transmission and localization properties of the two types of stacks. in the localized regime, m - stack stacks exhibit markedly different transmission properties at long wavelengths. for example, in the long wavelength region, a relatively thick ( ballistic ) disordered stack ( m-stack ) transmits almost entirely with one layer and its thickness is very weakly correlated with the thickness of the remaining layer ; whereas for shorter wavelengths, almost entirely the opposite is true. moreover, the cross section for each type of stack is very large so that even small absorption is powerful enough to totally suppress localization. this localization difference is most pronounced in the region of the transition from a fully transparent to a transparent regime. for the entire layered structure, the waves are almost entirely localized over the entire wavelength region ; in the ballistic regime, however, the transmission properties are markedly absent. this difference is due to the absence of the anderson localization region ( the crossover region ) which is responsible for the strong transmission coupling between the two regimes. the effects of loss are also considered. it is shown that when a finite sample is sufficient, sufficient refractive index and thickness of each layer are present, the spectrum of almost all waves is completely suppressed and the waves travel throughout the entire stack, not just within the localized region as is commonly done in homogeneous media. the localization length can be measured directly and directly ( via transmission experiments ). 99 t. maiman, a. h. safavi - naeini, m. aglietta, and o. alibart, _ theory of scattering and absorption in metamaterials _ ( crc press, boca raton, russian federation, 2010 ). i. v. smith and r. a. snyder, ` ` spectrally averaged transmission through an array of modulated thin layers, '' phys. rev. lett. * 102 *, 033840
this paper is the first in a series on deriving improved stellar population parameters for local field and group elliptical galaxies based on the high - quality spectral data of gonzalez ( 1993 ; g93 ). the present paper concentrates on correcting existing population models for the effects of _ non - solar _ abundance ratios. one of the major new features of our treatment is that models with _ constant _ @xmath0 are nearly indistinguishable in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ), so that age and metallicity are _ nearly degenerate _ in the spectra of old stellar populations. we use the model - atmosphere line - strength response functions of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) to model the lick / ids sample of local galaxies. the models are then used to derive single - burst stellar population ( ssps ) parameters for each galaxy age, and a measure of the total dwarf - to - giant light. we supplement the g93 data with data on the c - sensitive feature c@xmath624668 for stars over a wide range of temperatures and metallicities. using these three ingredients, it finally becomes possible to compute absorption - line strengths for three new features : ( 1 ) the ` ` 3/2 law '', ( 2 ) a sensitivity feature measuring the presence of hot a and b stars, and ( 3 ) the ca - peak, or ` ` enhanced '', elements. the results of the analysis of tcb98 show that the integrated spectrum of an elliptical galaxy is indeed depressed over its _ integrated _ spectrum, but that this is not due to age, but is due to a changing mixture of stellar luminosities and metal abundances. the effect of using the corrected models is larger for the older galaxies in the sample. for the youngest galaxies, we find that old ages are only slightly younger than young ages. the difference is larger than a factor of 3 for the galaxies in common, and is entirely due to the fact that galaxies with _ increasing _ fe - peak elements have slightly younger mean ages. we determine the mean element abundance ratios of the sample galaxies ; the results are consistent with the models of worthey ( 1994 ).
in this paper, we consider a problem of load balance allocation in cloud data centers. given a set of @xmath0 identical machines ( pms ) and an arbitrary number of vms, each request can be shared by pms if the total vm quota at any time does not surpass the total capacity that the resource can provide. under virtualization, cloud datacenters can be a distributed network in structure, containing many compute nodes ( such as servers ), storage nodes, and network devices such that each node is formed by a series of resources such as cpu, memory and network bandwidth and so on. the definition and model defined by this paper are aimed to be general enough to be used by a variety of cloud providers and focus on the infrastructure as a service ( iaas ). interval scheduling with capacity sharing ( iswcs ) is a standard scheduling model that employs a single resource allocation interval ( i.e., a pm ) and a task to balance the load of a pm with respect to a vm reservation. the key feature of iswcs is that the number of errata ( e.g. vm reservations ) is not defined but rather the range of time scales ( for example, vm reservation time ) is defined. consequently, there are many different algorithms developed to solve the iswcs load balance scheduling problem. most of existing research considers fixed interval constraints of vm allocation. this paper proposes a new strategy to load balance by modifying the traditional interval scheduling problem and considering life cycles characteristics of both vms and pms. to the best of our knowledge, proactive vm migration by pre - partition has not been studied yet in the open literatures. the major difference between offline and online scheduling is in the fact that online schedulers only know current request and status of all pms but offline preliminaries know all the requests and status to be jointly allocated by both machines. the analysis of the performance of different scheduling algorithms is also presented and compared. it is found that : ( 1 ) in terms of average utilization, makespan, time costs, and capacity@xmath1makespan, offline versus online algorithms have 8 - 13% lower average makespan and load balance lower than random - robin ( rr ), ( 2 ) the online greedy algorithm has 8 - 40% lower initial and final makespan than pmg and lpt, and ( 3 ) the offline scheduling with causal dependency analysis presents a better performance than the online one. vm reservation, load balance, time sharing, cloud data center, interval scheduling,
we propose a scheme to realize the remote and unconditionally transfer of gaussian quantum discord, which represents the quantum teleportation of entangled state, by applying the technique of entanglement swapping in continuous variables. the transfer scheme is based on the application of two independent gaussian states, one of which is an einstein - podolsky - rosen entangled state as ancillary state, and the other is a quantum discordant state, which is a coherent state with an attenuation dependent discording noise. we show that the output quantum discord of the transferred gaussian state is higher than the initial quantum discord and that it can be used as a resource for quantum information processing. the reasons why this happens are analyzed. comparing the noise variances on two quantum correlated beams, alice and bob, who represent two nodes in a quantum information network, send one of them to the middle station owned by claire, who interferes with it on a 50 % beam - splitter. the entangled state is sent to claire with amplitude and phase modulators ( eomx and eomp ), where the quantum discord between the two modulated states is increased by attenuating one or both optical modes. by increasing the attenuation of one mode, the quantum correlation of the output state is decreased, while the discord of both modes is increased, leading to the increase of the total quantum discord. when the optimal gain factor and the discordic noise of the transfer state are chosen, the maximum output quantum correlation is obtained. we also find that this feature is useful for constructing a quantum network. the maximum quantum discord is obtained when optimal gain in the channel of classical channel and squeezing parameter of the epr entangled state with optimal gain is chosen. we further analyze the physical reason why this unit gain factor can be larger than that of the initial one. at a given gain factor, the gain factor is the same as that of initial state, while when optimal attenuation is chosen, it is the opposite. this is because the interference between the coherent states is reduced by the decrease of both attenuation and gain factors. we conclude that there are several ways to improve the quality of quantum correlation in quantum networks. we finally conclude that the proposed scheme is a useful resource for state preparation, quantum state merging and quantum key distribution.
we present a numerical analysis of an operation of an rf - atom laser based on a system of bose - einstein condensates coupled to a @xmath0-axis resonator via a generalized gross - pitaevskii equation. the outcoupling rate in the real world is determined by the strength of the radio freqency. we show that in the weak coupling regime the output of such a laser is a factor of two higher than in the one dimensional thomas - fermi approximation. the difference is most probably due to dimensional effects : in the 1d case there is only a resonance point at the resonance point, whereas in 3d the effect is taken into account on a resonance surface defined by the distance to the trap center. the trap is usually elongated in the horizontal plane, the short horizontal axis of the gpe defining the resonance axis. our numerical data therefore agree with the experimental data only for relatively strong couplings. we also show that there is a ` ` bump '' in the curve of the effective potentials at a given coupling ; this is an artifact caused by a collective contribution of the two modes which originated from the dimerized state of the untrapped condensate. it is not clear if this feature is an intrinsic feature of the 3d atom laser or something else. 99 p. hnsch, in _ a guide to ultracold atom physics _, m. bloch, ed. ` ` advances in atom physics and techniques, '' ( wiley - ieee, new york, 1998 ). w. tittel, j. p. woermann, and h. zbinden, ` ` ` single - photon source of superluminal atom radiation, '' phys. rev. lett. * 69 *, 3316 - 3318 ( 1969 ). m. m. peng, y. shih, and m. d. lukin ` ` on - axis switching between kerr - mode and mhd - mode in a bose gas, '' nature * 475 *, 236 - 236 ( 1972 ). p. ben - abdallah and s. b. chang + _ theory division, department of physics, university of california, berkeley, usa _ + e - mail : rben@sas.berkeley.edu _ + keywords : rb-87, atom laser, gpes, weak coupling
the quantum backaction between different energy levels of a quantum dot ( dqd ) and a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) is investigated in terms of the current, shot noise, the fano factor, and the skewness, using a microscopic approach based on the born - markov approximation. we show that the backaction can dramatically affect the counting statistics of electrons transported through a dq d system by dephasing its energy levels, so that it may lead to either the current or the shot noise increasing or decreasing, depending on the value of the energy difference between the single - dot levels. in addition, we find that the distribution of transported electrons can deviate from the gaussian in a way which can lead to a significant broadening of the tunneling - coupling region, which can be controlled by the strength of the interdot coulomb interaction. numerical simulations in order to study the effect of the qpc - induced backaction on the quantum counting statistics are also presented. quantum entanglement plays an important role in the identification of quantum states of matter@xcite. one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum transport in nature is the quantum statistics, which characterizes the probability distributions of particles at different densities of states. in particular, the quantum dots ( qpcs ) and quantum point contacts ( qps ), consisting of two parallel two - dimensional ( 2d ) dots, are of special interest because they are known to be able to transport charge quanta ( electrons ) in the quantum degenerate regime, and yet they have the quantum numbers which are difficult to quantify. due to the fact that qps are weakly coupled, their quantum statistics can not be directly measured, unless a quantum number is measured, which is beyond the reach of current measurements in normal solid - state devices. however, they can be modelled on theoretical models, in which the quantum number density of states of the dot - quantum dot system is measured by means of a measurement device such as a quantum key distribution device ( qtd ). as a result, electrons can be transported through qcd without direct electron - electron interactions, and then be measured indirectly through the barrier between the two qpc s energy levels ( i.e., the so - called charge detector ). this is precisely what we study in this paper. we study the transport of electrons through a lateral dimer - quinn - diqd in a strong coupling between a few electrodes, the goal is to determine the statistics of the quantum
we have used kpno 2.1 m radio, near - ir, optical, and infrared imaging and spectroscopy to investigate the radio morphology and properties of the @xmath0 galaxy 0313 - 192. this object has been incorrectly classified as a powerful fanaroff - riley i radio galaxy. we find that the radio power and morphology are consistent with those of a seyfert 1 galaxy. the nucleus is highly reddened, presumably dominated by large amounts of dust, and has a morphology very unlike that of a s0 or early - type spiral. the radio spectrum is intermediate between emission from a disk - like galaxy and a starburst, with significant emission at wavelengths between 0.1 and 2.2 micron. we identify the dust - lane bisecting the nucleus as the likely source of the large - scale radio emission. the morphology of the radio source is quite unusual for a source of this type, with several indications that this is a spiral ( and certainly a disk galaxy ) rather than the normal elliptical. from our high - resolution spectrum, we find an l(@xmath1 ) = 2.6, consistent with a hubble - classification of sa - sb spirals. the difference in median luminosity of this disk - dominated galaxy between the two most powerful fr i radio sources known ( 0.05 abell radii ) is as high as 20 mjy. the total angular extent of its radio lobes is 100 times larger than the scale - height of the disk observed nearly edge - on. we suggest that this radio galaxy is either a low - luminosity, low - surface brightness s0 galaxy or an extremely under - luminous, obscured starburst / agn. the optical morphological classification as an elliptical galaxy is consistent with the combined presence of a nuclear starburst and/or weak agn activity rather than a circumnuclear starburst. the nuclear spectrum is typical of non - thermal, optically thin disk emission, and the optical line ratios suggest that the hot dust may be contained either in the disk or in a small amount of nonstellar ionization, although the ionization paremeter and line ratios in the nucleus are intermediate between the typical nuclear emission of agn and disk galaxies. the extremely red color of the nucleus ( [ oii]@xcite ) and the nucleus itself suggest that a significant amount of dust is present in the system. taken together, this indicates that the nuclear emission is dominated by thermal or non -
the draco and ursa minor dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are among the faintest known members of the local group of galaxies and they are thought to be at an early stage of the evolution of the building blocks that may have had a primary role in the assembly of the milky way galaxy. in this paper we present the results of a large observational programme aimed at determining the distances of these galaxies, with the use of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) as a standard candle. the study was enabled by obtaining well calibrated ( v, i ) photometry of the evolved stars of umi and draco over a field of view @xmath0 arcmin@xmath1. the color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of the two galaxies are presented and the positions and magnitudes of all the stars identified as members of their respective stellar populations are obtained. we report the first comparison of the stars in these two galaxies and conclude that they show a very similar distribution of metallicity, age and metallicities. the difference in the slope of the differential luminosity function ( lf ) can be attributed to the presence of the rgb - bump, that is an evolutionary feature that flags the point where the h - burning shell crosses the chemical discontinuity left by the maximum penetration of the convective envelope. this feature was recently identified in a globular cluster and it is believed to have been recently detected in a significant number of clusters. we demonstrate that the structures of dra and umi are significantly structured and that its stars are clustered according to two characteristic scale - lenghts. this is contrary to what is seen in draco, which has a significantly different from the other galaxies in the sample. we also discuss the importance of artificial stars experiments, that use non - homogeneous photometries to calibrate the photometric calibration of standard hst / wfpc2 photometry. the adopted distance moduli derived for draco as well calibrated with the triangulum distance scale as calibrated by @xcite are in good agreement with the recent trgb distance scale reported by f99. also in this case the agreement with results of other studies and with the constraints obtained in 5.1 is quite good. we conclude that the distance measurements presented here represent a very important first attempt to bridge the gap between old and young stellar populations in these galaxies.
the creation of a single photon in a cavity is enabled by landau - zener ( lz ) transitions, which are a crucial step in the preparation of a quantum state. here we propose a four - step lz cycle for single - photon generation in a circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) setup. at the first stage, a qubit is connected to an oscillator via an optical mode ( josephson coupling ) and a lz transition is induced in the ground state. in the second stage, one can control the final state of the qubit - oscillator system. the third step consists of the production of one photon via lz sweeps in the cavity, which is followed by the release of this individual photon via the reverse lz sweep. the fourth stage consists of a controlled amplification of the flux in the superconducting loop within the cavity. this scheme, which takes advantage of two advantageous properties of circuit qed, is based on controllability of the coupling strength against parameter variations when operating in the adiabatic limit. it possesses an appealing form : it is independent of the actual oscillator frequency @xmath0 and, in reality, it is determined by the critical current. a realistic implementation of this scheme is thus feasible and may allow for the realization of quantum state preparation. + single photons are an important resource for quantum information processing. they play an important role in quantum cryptography ( qip ) @xcite and are also of interest in other areas, such as superconductivity ( stoc ) and superconductors ( such as the underdoped standard model and the future cherenkov - fermi paradox ). despite their importance, the generation of single photons is usually achieved with a two - step process, starting from a ground state and ending with a final state characterized by a unique entanglement between the ( spatially unresolved ) qubit and the oscillator. such a process is termed ` ` lz '' transitions, in which not only the two levels interact, but also a larger number of levels cross, giving rise to an entangled entangled state. the lz phenomenon has been studied in a number of quantum technologies, including spin - squeezed superposition states of two particles, squeezed two - dimensional electron gas, squeezed atomic ensembles, and cavity qed. in all these cases, the number of photons created per pass through the circuit depends on the parameters on which the circuit is resonant. the simplest and most celebrated example is the boltzmann effect
the radio - guided surgery ( rgs ) technique is a promising newurgical method that facilitates the visualization of the tumor and the delineation of its margins. one critical element of the proposed rgs method is the @xmath0 probe, which will allow the mapping and extraction of the target lesioned tissue from the healthy organs. in order to be applicable to patients with brain tumor recurrence, the probe needs to be very compact, able to penetrate only a few millimetres of tissue and operating in a low radiation background. it also requires a smaller activity to detect tumor remnants compared to traditional rgs approaches. for the latter, due to the lower absorbed dose and the short range of electrons, the radiation exposure of the medical personnel requires in a significant fraction of the cases about 5 - 6 s to reduce the probing time to 1 s. in the case of meningioma, this would be possible because of the high receptivity to somatostatine analogues, but in many cases a therapeutical activity of 20mbq / kg would have to be administered. to this aim, this paper studies the uptake of dotatoc ( [ 1,4,6,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane - n, n@xmath2,n=2,0,d - phe1,tyr3]octreotide ( dot atoc ). the first goal of this study was to assess the capability of the rgs in real time to discriminate between lesion and healthy tissue. two cases of interest, in which the tumor is recurrence and the healthy tissue is a viable target, were examined by means of a pet scan and consist of several slices of the pet scan, in each of it a region of interest ( roi ) that were resected using the completeness of the resection images ( ct scan ). tumoral lesion resection, with target lesion, and resective margins, were defined. from this information the specific activity of the radiation - emitting tracer was estimated. subsequently, the protocol was applied to two patients with high grade glioma and low grade tumor ( hgg ). in both cases the following results were obtained : ( 1 ) the response of the tracer to the prescribed activity was found to be comparable to that of a sham tracer, independent of the presence of a tumor residual ; and ( 2 ) the improvement in the precision of the uptake was attributed to the larger permissible tumor - to -
we present results of the na49 experiment studying transverse momentum @xmath0 fluctuations in central pb+pb collisions at 20@xmath1, 30, 40, 55, 80, 90, 120, 158, 200 gev of cern data ( 7.2 % most central ). the data used for the analysis consist of data taken in collisions at densities from 20 to 40@xfig1, using the large - volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) at the cern super proton synchrotron and bnl relativistic heavy ion collider. the 6.5 fm and 160 fm particle correlation lengths were estimated assuming first a short correlation length ( 3 to 6 fm ), and they suggest an increase of the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution in full phase space by 2 for all charged particles ( uncorrelated particle production ) and by 1 for same - charge particles ( charged or same - charged ). data shows an approximately linear dependence of the distribution of the event - wise event - by - event transverse momenta @xfig2, with a mean value of 1.8 %, and a residual 1.7 % for the forward and backward rapidity regions. the widths of these fluctuations are dependent on the particle multiplicity and on the fraction of accepted particles. furthermore, the magnitude of the forward rapidity region effect, measured as a function of energy, appears to be dependent on both the collision energy and the size of the colliding nuclei. assuming that the fluctuations are due to pure statistical fluctuations, the results are presented for multiplicity fluctuations and show a clear increase toward lower energies. for all three charge selections, the mean transversemomentum fluctuation of the 32.6 % transverse - momentum @xcite is observed for systems that hadronize from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and freeze out near the critical point of qcd. for lower energies, the data suggest that the freeze - out point is located at the low sps energies. recent results from the na61/shine experiment indicate that strongly interacting matter at energy densities exceeding about 1 gev / fm(1 ) is likely to be at the bottom sps energy, rather than at the top. this is motivated by the increasing evidence that deconfined matter is formed at the beginning of the phase diagram of strongly interacting quarks and gluons. finally, we present new estimates for the effects of the critical
we explore what class of antenna layouts for radio telescope arrays that allow cheap calibration and systematics control, with correlator cost scaling as @xmath0 ( in terms of the number of antennas ) rather than @xaugh1, and that are useful for science applications requiring improved correlator sensitivity at widely separated angular scales. we will refer to such arrays as _ omniscopes_. this class of arrays is encouragingly large, including not only the well - known rectangular fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) grids but also arbitrary ( omnichromatic ) hierarchies of such grids, with arbitrary rotations and shears at each level. this opens up the possibility of getting the best of both worlds, combining affordable signal processing with baseline coverage tailored to specific scientific needs. the computational savings come at a price, which is partially compensated by sky rotation, which eliminates the need for calibration errors, and provides an opportunity for vastly improved control of systematics. examples illustrate how multiple measurements from such arrays can be rapidly merged into shared sky maps, for example 21 cm tomography ( where short baselines are needed to map essentially the whole sky above the horizon at the horizon ), or cosmology ( where long baselines is needed for point source removal ). 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 p. pringsheim, ` ` astronomy and particle physics, '' * 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3 rev. mod. phys. * a * * # 1*(#2 ), # 3 ( # 2 ) [ cols= " >, < ", ] # 1figure [ fig. 1 ] shows how each antenna in each grid instantaneously measures a different set of visibilities, giving a pop - up of what we refer to as ` ` visibilities ''. each visibility is simply the correlation of signals from antennas separated by the corresponding distance vector ( known as a baseline ) summed over all pairs with the same separation. this is a simple but effective way to load - scan the array, without actually having to discretize any data from each antenna. for example, one can use simulated annealing or another suitable tool to solve the nonlinear optimization problem of where to place the antennas, either to simply arrange the antennas to either place the data from the hierarchical grid or to use the 6-dimensional hypercube for completely accurate calibration. the hypercube algorithm offers a powerful tool for getting accurate baselines and calibration errors by getting rid of
we have used hst wfpc2 photometry of a field in the outskirts of the globular cluster ngc 2808 to obtain a deep, high precison color - magnitude diagram of the main sequence ( ms ). about 1520 % of the ms stars have @xmath0 ; these stars are blue main sequence stars and populate the blue horizontal branch ( hb ) clump of the hb. the blue ms stars are most simply interpreted as a group of stars substantially coeval with the other ms stars of the cluster, but with a helium abundance exceeding the primordial value. in contrast, the red hb stars have a much higher helium abundance and are most likely to be cluster members. the precise abundance of the high helium population depends on the color transformations, and we urge the computation of model atmospheres with the cluster chemical abundances and taking into account helium enhancement. we show that helium abundance may play a major rle in determing differences between the populations of different globular clusters and within the population of a given cluster. we propose a scenario that simultaneously accounts for the anomalous ms and hb morphology in the cmd of ngc2808. our scenario suggests _ i ) _ that the main stages of star formation are _ from _ the very early stage of massive agb stars, which produce the helium rich ms, _ ii ) _that the mass accretion from the very first star formation episode, plays a minor role in stabilizing the intermediate helium abundance range, and that _ iii ) _ the discontinuity between the helium abundance distribution and the observed color bifurcation is due to a discontinuity in the external gaseous gas component, from _ i _ the star formation field, to the one populated by the later type ii supernova ejecta. in addition, we suggest that the helium ejecta from the binary evolution of the first supernova ( which goes dynamo, from a low to a high mass agb star ) may have been responsible for the formation of the complex cluster, and for the presence of blue tails in the horizontal branches. we discuss the advantages of our scenario in the study of the chemical inhomogeneities in metal rich, low metallicity clusters.
we compute the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnlo ) corrections to the bfkl equation for the production of up to four gluons, with a three - parton forward cluster in the strong coupling constant @xmath0, at leading order ( lo ) accuracy, in the qcd framework. the computation is performed in the framework of the color ladder method, a gauge - invariant numerical method based on the tree - level double - splitting and the gluon reggeization. the results are compared with the ones obtained in the dimensional reduction scheme for the same value of the leading - order parameter, in order to show the factorization relations in the multi - collinear limits. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2009 + * multi - gluonal tree amplitudes in qcd at nlo accuracy * + + _ submitted to _ phys. lett. b _ _ * # 1 * _ * pacs : 11.10.hi, 11.25.jv, 12.38.bx, 13.40.hq + _ * keywords : * qcd, multijet rates, gluonic and eikonal scattering, qcd + _ classification _ : 21.8, 21.5, 22.5 + _ nature of physical problem _ : + the computation of the multichannel elastic scattering of two partons is an important part of qcd. the parton loss in the final state hadronization of the strong - coupling tensor can be studied by the use of the advanced cdf algorithm @xcite. in this context, it is crucial to organise the cancellation of the infrared singularities in a universal, i.e. process - independent, way. the large infrared amplitudes obtained in this way allow one to obtain the tree parts of the nlo impact factors, which are characteristic of the scattering process at hand. in practice, the lo impact factors are typically obtained by the following methods : first, by the lipatov vertex decomposition in terms of the linearly independent subamplitudes only ; then by the exact yet simple method of summing up the helicity states of the partons provided by the one - loop amplitudes ( see e.g. the references quoted above ). in a field - theoretical basis, the second approach allows to extract the
variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) methods are used to generate statistical estimates of the expectation values of an operator candidate over a random distribution of @xmath0 dimensional vectors. standard sampling and residual sampling strategies are considered and shown to provide different distributions of random error in the estimates. estimates for the total energy and residual variance are derived for an isolated all - electron carbon atom. the fact that the random error is controlled by the weight function and the residual variance is re - introduced into the analysis in order to take into account the asymptotic behaviour of the second moment of the sampled quantity. it is shown that the power law tail of the distribution of the estimated total energy for a given weight function is not a power law, but a mott insulator. the statistical properties of determination of the variance of the local energy, the ratio of its expectation value to the true value, and the weight dependence of the inferred variance are characterised for the different sampling strategies. determinations of the size of the sample and weight function are also considered. for the case of an isolated carbon atom, the data support the ` bivariate clt'approach of characterising the variance using weight functions that employ the bivariate probability density function. the model distribution and the standard sampling strategy are compared, and confidence intervals for the range of values of the relevant weights are obtained. there are no similarities in the statistics of the weights and correlations between the two sampling strategies considered. there is a ` maximum number'of weight functions required for the sample to give a maximum statistical error, in contrast to the situation for standard sampling where the maximum likelihood distribution is statistically acceptable for large deviations from the true one. confidence intervals are provided for the weights by extending the one dimensional bivariate normal distribution to a two dimensional confidence interval in the two dimensional space. the conventional clt is therefore no longer a valid approximation when the two weight functions are not aligned. the clt, and its variants, are therefore not valid for many real systems, and should be replaced with something less ` specialised'or ` imprecise '. in this context, it is important to consider variational sampling as a means of generating information about quantities that can be measured with a modal accuracy that is independent of the statistical errors in the measured quantities that are to be measured, and that is the primary objective of this letter.
we investigated the magneto - transport of electrons in a two - dimensional electron gas under adiabatic microwave irradiation. our aim was to study the effect of the driving field amplification on the magnetoresistance in the limit of no scattering and of the absence of transitions between landau levels. in addition we investigated the dependence of the resistance @xmath0 on the microwave frequency and on the magnetic field. our measurements show that the resistance drops systematically with frequency and increases with the increase of the microwave field near the edges of the sample. this behavior is completely unexpected and can not be explained by an increase in the temperature of the electron. we develop a model explaining the observed drop of resistance through the dynamics of orbits skipping along the sample edge and find that it is well described by a simple model of multi - photon absorption by the guiding center radiation. this model was also successfully confronted with experimental results on a limited range of microwave power and magnetic fields. we discuss the possible significance of the two timescale for phototransport in two dimensional electron gases and on a qualitative description of the enhancement of the drift velocity by slowly varying microwave field. fields with strong magnetic field, such as those coming from stimulated raman scattering, are already in their infancy compared to electrons in solid state limits. yet they appear to be able to explain the observed phenomena in two dimensions ( 2degs ). the main difficulties in explaining the nature of the 2deg are that they have a very weak heating and very strong electron scattering, thus the effects of boundary conditions are not accounted for. it is therefore difficult to construct theories on their properties valid at all magnetic fields @xcite. for the most of the regimes investigated our experimental observations were limited to a relatively large range of magnetic fields up to a milli - jansky level. the limiting case of zero - point resistance was also investigated in detail in a previous paper@xcite, where a strong decrease in resistance was observed in the vicinity of the edge for sufficiently strong magnetic fields and high microwave power. in this paper we focus on a weaker effect which has not been properly taken into account in the existing models. namely the presence of a strong microwave field which is applied straight in the semiclassical limit. when the applied hard wall potential is applied along the edge, the resistivity drops steeply with frequency. the observed reduction of resistance at low frequency is expected to be very similar to the case of a homogeneous distribution of plasmon excitations in a solid state system, however this effect is absent
we present a comprehensive analysis of the data on stellar mass black hole binaries in the _ swift _ ccd archive as of june 2010. our sample consists of 27 binary systems observed through august 2010, including four x - ray binaries. the data are used to study the evolution of the accretion disk down to temperatures as low as 0.2 kev for the first time. approximately half of the spectra are found to require the addition of a disk component at luminosities larger than the 5@xmath0 common to all binaries in our sample. if we lower the criteria for improvement to 5 % and apply the spectral analysis to a sample of 10 black hole candidates, the number of spectra consistent with a power - law alone is significantly increased, up to 50 %. in the case of the ` diskpbb+po ` model, the best fit spectral model is consistent with an irradiated disk at all energies. however, the inability to reproduce the observed spectra with a standard steady state disk, when applied to our sample, is found to be a result of the limitations of the optical / uv data available in the literature. a single observation of the black hole binary 4u 1957 + 11 suggests that the disk may be truncated near the luminosity probed, at least up to @xmath1 10 times higher in luminosity than previously claimed. in light of these results, we discuss the empirical relationships displayed in the data, which can be used to inform / constrain theoretical models and/or characterise source types. most of the multi - wavelength observations are consistent with emission from an optically thin, optically thick disk dominated by soft x - rays. this disk emission is in broad agreement with the behavior observed in seyfert galaxies, suggesting that it is emitted by the corona, though a significant contribution from jet emission can not be ruled out. no significant spectral hardening is detected in individual black hole spectra, which suggests that a disk contribution is required for those spectra probing the transition from the hard to the soft state. in particular, we find that emission from the agn is observed to be present in gx 339 - 4, but that this is unlikely to be the dominant driver of the observed behavior in this source. # 1to 0pt#1 [ firstpage ] accretion, accretion discs black hole physics radiation mechanisms : non - thermal radiative transfer
the accretion disk model by shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) has been considered as the ` ` standard '' model for the low mass x - ray binaries and galactic black - hole candidates ( gbhcs ) in their soft state. however, when the accretion rate approaches the eddington luminosity, some assumptions break down and the standard model can not adequately describe the nature of such high luminosity objects. in this paper, we discuss how the functional form of viscosity may be able to describe some features of such exotic sources, which are not discussed in the context of the canonical synchrotron / schrdinger ( ssd ) theory. the global stability analysis for the slim disk model has been carried out by honma et al. ( 1991 ) and it has been shown that the disk is stable as long as the viscous heating, radiative cooling and advective cooling terms are included. the temperature @xmath0 at the transition from the soft to the hard state is computed as a function of the black hole mass and the specific angular momentum. we use the same prescription for the shear stress tensor as that by szuszkiewicz ( 1990 ). in the perturbative limit ( i.e., with the expansion rate being proportional to the gas pressure ), we find that the local stability is carried by the pressure - dominated broad - band spectral energy distribution ( balmer scattering ) effect, while the temperature - dominated spectral scattering is provided by the hard - scattering component only. the effect of the hardening of the spectrum is included ( it is just analogous to the compton scattering effect in the effect described by the ssd theory ). the calorimeter spectrum is calculated and it is found that the model is more consistent with the recent observations if we take the extreme case of low black hole masses and high accretion rates into account. our calculation provides solid analytical grounds for the conclusion of the previous paper that the current observational data suggests. ultra - luminous compact x - rays sources ( ulxs ) in nearby spiral galaxies are discussed and the possibility of explaining their mysterious nature in relation to the super - critical accretion disks is briefly discussed.
_ chandra _ observations have been used to study the x - ray properties of early- and late - type stars in the pleiades open cluster. a total of 56.8 ks of data were obtained using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) detector at the european southern observatory ( eso ), and an additional 21.2 ks were taken at the nasa very large telescope ( vlt ), which are located at the lawrence berkeley telescope national observatory, which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy, inc., under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555. we detected eighteen bona fide pleiading stars and all five of possible late type companions in the fifth quadrant of the fuv - newton field of view ( fov ). high - resolution spectra revealed that sixteen of the stars have known or late - types companions, and thirteen of the twenty - two stars have not been detected in x - rays. seven of the late type stars exhibited flares during the observations, but four of them were detected in the fov. the flare magnitudes of the unidentified sources are 1.12.5 times smaller than those found in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey of b stars with known late- or early - type companions. the 0.58.0 kev luminosities of the unresolved sources indicate that they have low effective hydrogen column densities ( @xmath0@xmath1 ). we concluded that the majority of the emission in the faint end of the hii 1384 model is produced by young stars. we have used the properties of the faint background stellar populations detected by acis to place constraints on the hubble constant and luminosity limits for the early- type companion hypothesis. in addition, we have determined that the lmc and the mekal populations are associated with a large population of faint, variable active galactic nuclei. unfortunately, the two populations are difficult to reliably distinguish from one another due to the low signal - noise in the acis images.
we study the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in the framework of the electro - weak theory in different stages of the stellar evolution. in the non - degenerate region the process becomes significant when the temperature remains above @xmath0 k. moreover, the process has a significant contribution in the extreme - relativistic region, especially when the electrons are strongly degenerate. the process also contributes to the energy loss in the stellar core during the late stages of stellar evolution, even though the process is not dominating in any particular region, it is essential to take into account the contributions of both these processes. we find that during the neutron star cooling process the process causes a large amount of energy loss. this process is particularly important for the magnetic field which may be close to or greater than the critical magnetic field. finally, we consider the processes which are effects of a strong magnetic field on the stellar interior. comparison of our results with those obtained in the low energy region shows that the magnetic fields can not be very strong, in fact, the scattering cross - section for the nebulae is always smaller than that for the protostar. stellar interior, magnetic fields, stars : evolution stars : magnetic fields
we present new mid - infrared spectroscopy, obtained with the @xmath0 m spectrograph on the vlt, of the t8.5 dwarf wolf 940 b, which is a companion to an m4v star with a projected separation of 400 au. the spectrum is very rich in emission lines, mainly due to the stellar absorption, and is well fitted by a heavily reddened model atmosphere with a slightly sub - solar metallicity ( [ m / h]@xmath1 ). this new data, together with the near - infrared spectrum and parallax data presented by bonfils et al. ( 2009 ), allows a rigorous analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the dwarf. the improved accuracy of the luminosity we derive enables us to refine the earlier results of b09 ( who used the same data ), and constrain the t dwarf s age to be in the range 3 to 5 gyr. we use evolutionary and atmospheric models to calculate an accurate total luminosity for the system, and use the colors of both the primary and the secondary to provide additional constraints on their atmospheric properties. we derive a total gravity consistent with the model predictions, and a solar or slightly metal - rich solution for the primary. the improvement in the fit of the spectrum since b09 is significant also in terms of shape of the potential energy distribution, allowing us to consider the possibility that the scattering amplitude of the stars in this system is larger than what is observed. we are able to match the observed flux ( with slightly higher accuracy than before ), but the flux predicted by the models is not quite as good as the observed one. this is likely due to a combination of effects including mixing, which can not be accounted for in simple models, and also because of the high effective temperature of the system. even if the flux is accurately determined, the uncertainty in the gravity must be significantly larger than that provided by the simple models. the model atmosphere constrains the age to lie between 7 and 14 gyr, and the mass to be between 38 and 47 m@xday. we discuss implications of these results for the t7.5 dwarfs, and conclude that they may be very young, in contrast to some recent results on the m4 dwarf gl 570d.
we report on the detection of a long - term dip in the flux of the anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 during the period of near - ir quiescence in 2004 - 2006. its pulsed flux began in late 2001, and increased by a factor of over two in 2004. it remained fairly stable in flux and spin until 2007 march, when it declined by @xmath020 %. this is the most dramatic flux increase of the past three years in x - rays. in 2005 - 2006, the axp entered a new phase of increased activity in the form of a burst ( _ vlt _ giant flare ) and subsequent quiescent dip. archival _ cxo _ and _ hst _ observations confirm the trend. the increase in flux in the far - ir was only marginally correlated with large luminosity variations. but, for the first time in the past two years, a significant increase in _ rxte _ timing was detected in the most recent ( 2007 march ) event. after the 2007 march glitch, the source recovered quickly from the episode of reduced activity. in the months following the burst, the flux declined in a correlated way, with the total flux increasing slowly on timescales of weeks to months. the steady evolution of the spin down rate followed a pattern similar in shape to that of the soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) giant flares. this suggests a magnetar origin of the unusual behaviour, with important differences in the pulsed fraction and spin stability. one of the major differences can be seen by comparing the slow - spin down to the giant flare behavior of sgrs. the difference in the rate of change in the torque and spin frequency between the two classes of object can be explained in terms of the energy - dependent twisted magnetosphere model : the magnetar has much larger inferred magnetospheric twist angles and a longer spin period than the sgr. in addition, the steady increase in torque is seen to be mirrored by an increase in the average spectral hardness of the source, in some ways reminiscent of the peculiar behaviour of some other axps.

we present a systematic analysis of the frequency resolved spectrum ( frs ) of the low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) banana, using a variety of methods to extract the variable component of the spectrum. we find that the peak frequency of the frs corresponds to 0.04 - 1.16 kev which is consistent with the presence of a hard boundary layer emitting about 40 % of the total luminosity in the system. the analysis indicates that the source emission is incident on a reflector with its signature in the form of a sharp dip ( qpo ) during one of the dips. the location of the highly ionized absorber in the inner disk is suggested to be associated with the reflection zone at 4.7 - 0.2 radii. according to the fit parameters, the strength of the fe k@xmath0 line in the conventional spectrum is too weak to resolve reliably the reflected component. however, we note that the system exhibits iron fe xxv and fe xxvi absorption lines and the system is viewed relatively close to edge - on. the conventional spectral analysis indicates a lack of orbital phase dependence of features except during dips suggesting that the absorber can be located in the thin cylindrical geometry around the compact object. the fits with a single blackbody model, a single power - law model or a combination of the two ( power+gauss ) do not yield acceptable fits. on the other hand, a fit with a blackbody plus a power law ( bbody plus power ) or a combinations of blackbody, power law and a gaussian emission line is redundant. the best fit results for each high frequency frs are achieved when the power spectral density ( psd ) is either 1.1 @xmath1 kev for the 0.9 - 6 hz range and 1.3 @xcite for the 8 - 30 hz frequency range. the disk - blackbody components appear mostly in the higher fourier frequency ranges. we do not recover any absorption features ( i.e., lines ) in the four frs we have calculated which may rule out the existence of a significant absorber within the inner zones of the accretion disk. although we do detect a resonance line at 6.4 kev in our frs spectra, the line is relatively weak and it is unlikely that the absorbing region is significantly extended. using the average number of equivalent widths and durations of the line detected by boirin et al. ( 2005 ) in our system, and assuming an
we present an analysis of wfpc2 f555w and f814w images for fifteen galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores. the color profiles are used to correct for the effects of dust, and are deprojected to derive the physical luminosity density and the nuclear stellar properties. in one galaxy, namely ngc 4365, the innermost region ( 15pc in size ) is bluer by about 0.05 mag than the surrounding regions. if interpreted as due to a variation in the stellar population, synthetic population models suggest an age younger by @xmath0 3 - 4 gyrs and a variation of about -0.2 dex between the feature and the adjacent galactic regions. the radial logarithmic slopes of the stellar profiles are found to cover a large range of values, from almost flat to very steep ( the slopes range from 0.1 - 0.8 ). even in the seven galaxies in which photometric evidence for a stellar disk ( or ring ) has been found, they show a clear break radius '', whereas other galaxies occupy the same region of parameter space as that occupied by kinematic - normal galaxies. there is no evidence for any difference between the colors of the very shallow and very steep cusps. despite a large diversity in the values of the global stellar parameters, the distributions of the galaxy colors and those of the galactic regions are consistent with a homogeneous, low - mass stellar population. this suggests that the nuclear colors provide a reliable ( if not unique ) characterization of the properties of the solar system. the galaxies that host strong nuclear stellar disks are the most gas - rich, massive galaxies in our sample, while the fainter ones show the opposite distributions. the dichotomy between the shallow cusp and the steep cusp is indicated by the relative faintness of the nuclear regions, but it remains unclear whether this dichotomy actually arises from a _ continuous variation _ of some parameter(s ) governing the galaxy formation and evolution.
a covariant model for a spin-0, two - fermion system with a symmetric vertex function in momentum space, with a pseudoscalar coupling between pion and quark degrees of freedom, is developed. the vertex function produces a light - front wave function symmetric by the interchange of quark and antiquark momenta, and is not affected by the use of the nonsymmetric regulator. in this framework, we evaluate the electromagnetic form factor of the system. the pair - term contribution is analytically evaluated both in the breit frame and in the central frame, using a modified impulse approximation. we consider two examples of breit frames, in which the momentum of the constituents has the same normalization constant as the space - time direction, i.e. @xmath0, and in a general non - relativistic frame. we find that, even taking into account the drell - yan condition on the momentum transfer, the pair term only contributes about one - third of the total electromagnetic current in the former case, and the whole contribution is accounted for in the latter case. the form factor is calculated using the fact that, in our model, the production of pairs contributes only to the south - west part of the amplitude of the bethe - salpeter amplitude, not to the north - east part. = 14pt # 1 # 2 # 3 _ int. j. mod. phys. _ * a#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3jhep * # 1 * ( # 2 ) # 3 # = 12 # = 23 # = by60 = # 1bsphack@filesw auxout gtempa @nobserv @nobreak esphack eqnlabel#1 # 1@underline#2 # 1 @=11 # 1 hep - ph/#1 @=12''' '' * pacs * : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba * electromagnetic form factors of spin-1 systems and nuclei in the presence of a strong impulse approximation * * acknowledgements : * h.p.a.

we present the first comprehensive ccd imaging in,, and of the area around, consisting of a rich network of filamentary and diffuse structures. we have analyzed public asca data in order to have a better comparison with existing radio, infrared, and x - ray observations. the aim was to cover the whole field of the, with the aim of studying the properties of the remnant s faint radio emission which may be related to its interaction with the interstellar medium. the ccd was obtained with the 0.3 m telescope at the skinakas observatory. two different filters were used, i(60 @xmath0 m ) and ( 1410 mhz ). the results show that the radio emission has a quite different morphology. the images show the presence of a north west ridge and a south west extension of diffuse emission coinciding with the known radio structure, as well as several small and large scale filamentary structures extending away from the radio source. the north east extension of the emission is well correlated with the ` ` ` break - out '' portion of the radio structure recently observed westward of the pulsar. the hi emission and the radio data indicate that the shock front has reached the edge of the cavity seen in hi emission at the position i. emission associated with the radio ridge is found at positions iii, iv, v and vi. the neutral hydrogen ( ism ) clouds seen in the hi data at these positions are extended and partially compressed. in addition several other small emitting structures are detected in the south east and the north west, lying just outside the faintest radio contours. the remnant has a high column density of [ oii]/[oiii]@xmath1 2.5 which is, on average, one to two orders of magnitude larger than estimated from the hi and ir emission. the high column densities suggest that the outer boundary of the pspc may be responsible for the breakout of the sn shell, and for the high velocity of the electromagnetic wind which deforms the shell, giving rise to the south western radio emission ridge. we further detect faint extended emission, which extends for more than 15 minutes in both the north south and west east directions. the total estimated column density indicates a large value of the preshock medium density, on the order of 100 m@xcite, and suggests that this represents a significant inhomogeneities in the ism. psr 1951 + 32 is a radio pulsar that was recently discovered in the immediate vicinity of. the radio and
the mysterious star @xmath0cas has long been known as the prototype of the class of classical be " variables. it is a b - type main sequence star with a circumstellar disk and has been known to emit anomalously high amounts of x - rays through the emission of the lyman@xmath1 and k - shell fexxv lines. however, once it was eventually discovered that it is not a typical be star after all - be stars at large emit at most a few times more soft x - ray flux than normal b stars. in the beginning years of the 20th century, there were competing interpretations of the spectral characteristics of this star. then, in 2001, the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites provided high time - resolution spectra sensitive to soft to medium band flux ( i.e., 0.5 - 3.0kev ). it was found that the fe k line ( 1.85 ) is strong enough to reveal a prominent fe k absorption feature at 1.78kev, and the presence of an unresolved fek fluorescence feature suggests that the feature is created by the deep gravitational potential of the degenerate secondary. little doubt that this feature and the fek emission ultimately result from synchrotron emission ( for a strongly magnetic secondary ) and/or thermalization of accreted matter onto the surface, accretion column, or accretion disk hosted by a degenerate companion. whether this latter hypothesis is correct " is still debated. the intermittent fe - k line emission pattern is a result of shock interaction between the companion star and nearby cold matter or a radiative transfer from the be star to a be star remains to be determined. the power - law tail of the flare - producing energy spectra is seen to follow an exponential function rather than a power law, which is in agreement with the findings of a number of statistical analyses of short - lived flares with high - quality _ rxte _ light curves. the flare lifetimes are found to be shorter than the fwhm lifetime limit of 4s. furthermore, the number distributions of flare energies over two different epochs have been found to follow exponential functions, in contrast to solar flares where bursts of energy are observed over timescales of a few hours to a few years. it should be emphasized that the flare properties are not determined by the duration of flare activity. we discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the interstellar medium of the galactic interstellar medium.
the relationship between topology and dynamics of strings is a fundamental but not studied topic of study. here we address this general problem. since the seminal paper by bigatti and lindesay, r.s. bekenstein, phys. rev. lett. 58, 1283 ( 1971 ), numerous examples of topological structures have been found and used to interpret the laws of physics. one of the most popular of these is the rope length which connects the strings, branes and gravity ( boulder ) on one side and the strings and branes on the other. the ` ` force field '' on the side of the boulder plays an important role in our understanding of both the topological structure of the universe and topology of the strings on the surface. an important example of the latter role is given by the disordered systems which are left uncovered in the standard model of topology : the deconfinement of a solid state into ` ` strings '' and ` ` branes ''. the emergent strings are the simplest topological objects in the universe, which are minimal in comparison to the infinite variety of natural and artificial structures studied in the literature. in the annals of physics, this is certainly the case as far as the tools to study topological models are concerned, since even the simplest models of cosmic strings can be considered to be topological. nevertheless, how to generalize to the case of strings has been a difficult task. for particle physics, the situation is more complicated as we shall see below. particle physics is characterized by the interplay between three very different degrees of freedom, the strings ( figure 1 ), the branes ( fig. [ fig. ( left ) ) and the chains ( right ) ) of strings. one well - known example of an object that can be classified as a ` ` ` particle '' is the boulder ( figure 2 ). a particle is defined as an object which is neither a particle nor a particle in the traditional sense, but which has a certain amount of regularity and symmetry. for example, the axial symmetries of two - dimensional strings are classified as ` ` topological '' ( tmo ) structures on the rock, gluons and tree trunks in @xmath0 dimensions. in this article we will focus on the tmo of string theories and propose a new definition of the three - dimensional boulder. the boulder is no longer a simple axial invariant, but instead we will discuss how string theories can be viewed as an effective description of
we study the angular dependence of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath0 in bhabha scattering, using data recorded by the opal detector at lep. we find the running of the coupling is consistent with the standard model prediction, and that the data are cleanly incompatible with the hypothesis of a fixed coupling. the values of the running across the acceptance cut are found to be in good agreement with the values obtained previously by the venus @xcite and l3 experiments. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 0=0 1= 1=1 0>1 # 1 /#1#2(#3)@xmath1 - 12pt = -1 cm = -2 cm = 1.5 cm 0.2 cm * measurement of the electric - field running of * * bhaba * * opal collaboration ( submitted to physics letters b ) the opals collaboration g.abbiendi@kc.ac.uk, c.ainsley@pibet.ox by m.f.kesson during the 1992/1993 fixed power year at cern. the collaboration has been in a paid - up form and the work has been partially supported by the university of edinburgh. the first published paper in the field of theoretical physics is due to g.alexander@phys.j.c.2 in 1997. he was attracted attention because of its high sensitivity to different physical phenomena, such as the heavy ion decays at low energies. in this paper we will focus on the physics that was responsible for his discovery, namely the high - resolution spectrometer ( siw ) on the vlt, with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the operation of the siw and the role of its interactions in the determination of the luminosity of the detector. we plan to make several measurements in the coming years. one of the most exciting lines of research at the present time is the measurement, with a very high experimental sensitivity, of the scaling of the physical quantities with energies. for example, the leptonic contribution to the amplitude of the electroweak coupling is directly estimated from the integrated luminosity, while the hadronic part is measured from the correlation function of observables near the resonance peak. this area of parameter space is, however, completely unexplored, so that at present a theoretical explanation is required for such a measurement. in the appendix we discuss the implications of our results from a theoretical point of view. 0.
we show that the velocity dispersion profiles and surface density profiles of star clusters can be well fitted by a simple analytical formula having a sharp cut - off radius, which could be interpreted as the tidal radius of the cluster. in contrast to that, @xcite and more recently @xcity found that young massive clusters in the lmc show an exponential surface density profile without any tidal truncation at the tidal boundary, i.e. at the jacobi radius. they interpreted these findings as being due to tidal debris which was expelled at birth from the clusters and has not had time to disperse yet. + it is found that similar fractions of stars should be present in clusters in a constant tidal field to the value found for young massive globular clusters. this number is significant for clusters of significant mass, e.g. the fornax dwarf spheroidal, which is too large to be explained by the canonical two - body relaxation picture. + potential escapers, stars which escape from the cluster before dispersing, play a significant role in the evolution of the tidal debris as well as the morphological imprint of the stars which are responsible for the exponential observed profiles. in particular, potential escaper stars should have a significant effect on the profiles of virialized star clusters and therefore should be considered as a possible tracer of the possible location of a cluster s tidal debris. + despite the fact that we derived solid physical parameters for the stars in our sample, our analysis shows that the physical uncertainty is large and that the possible truncation radius, @xmath0, is not defined in a physical sense. this uncertainty makes the derivation of the physical parameters difficult. as a consequence we emphasise that the concept of ` tidal radius'should not be used to replace the time scale of mass loss within clusters. + finally, we show that for a range of dynamical evolution parameters our results do not support the ` classic'picture where the dissolution times of clusters scale with the relaxation time.
we have determined accurate physical parameters ( age, metallicity, distance and reddening ) for a sample of intermediate - age stellar clusters ( iacs ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ), using hst / wfpc2 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the padova isochrones. this allowed us to quantify how the recovered physical parameters depend on the adoption of different stellar evolutionary libraries, including treatment for convective core overshooting. we found that, in the pel evolutionary library, the best - fit parameters are essentially unchanged by any of the three models that were used ( pel, basti & padova ). in the basti library, except for the least metal poor object ( pisces ), the parameters are unchanged by all three models. it is particularly important to make use of this fact in the work done here aiming to constrain models of the lmc using the cmds. there are no clear age dependencies in the quality of the fit for the three evolutionary libraries that are used, but the models with the best fit fit the data better than the classical ones. furthermore, for the pel and basti libraries, the degree of dispersion of the distance modulus is found to be large ( @xmath0 0.3 - 1.0 mag ) and independent of the adopted stellar evolutionary library. by self - consistency we mean the ability to simultaneously infer these parameters from the same data set without any prior assumptions about any of them. we expanded our analysis to two other evolutionary libraries ( basti and teramo ) and verified that the results agree well with the previous ones. we have also determined the individual distances to each cluster from the hst cmds, using which we find that the best model corresponds to the one that gives the observed cmds best fit parameters. this fact allows us to probe the three - dimensional distribution of these iacs, which seems to be roughly aligned with lmc disk.

we discuss the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density autocorrelation function ( acf ) in molecular clouds in terms of the distribution of the _ normalized _ column density ( i.e., with zero mean and unit variance ), assuming a lognormal underlying density field. we analyze the results from two recent three - dimensional numerical simulations of isothermal compressible mhd turbulence forced at intermediate - to - large scales ( 1/4 of the box size ), performed as part of a series of simulations of magnetic and non - magnetic isothermal turbulence, using random realizations generated from isothermal particle hydrodynamics simulations with ` ` non - isothermal '' and ` ` magnetic '' impurities along the line of sight. in both cases the acf smoothly decays to the 10 % level at relatively short separations ( @xmath0 ), with a small enough sample size that gaussian column density pdfs can be obtained in the dominant density regime. assuming that the small sample size is an indication of low column density, a gaussian pdf is obtained in two different cases of the underlying field, with the larger sample size implying that the central limit theorem ( clt ) may be applied to those events. the resulting pdf has a narrow range of different shapes, with one candidate for a long - range ( ` ` intermediate - scale '' ) pdf having a 10 % value, and the other for a short - range one with a near - constant value. this suggests that a small column density dynamic range might be indicative of large values of the ` ` decorrelation length '' ( ihep ). using a spectrum of density power spectra from numerical simulations and observations, we also show that the shape of the column density probability density pdf converges to a single gaussian, albeit slowly, in the cases we consider. the crux of the paper is that the logarithm of the local density fluctuations at each radius ( the so - called ` ` outer '' scale ), over which the density jump expected from a shock of a given strength is made, decays by a factor of 10 or more in the most favorable cases. we discuss the various factors that determine ( at least some of these factors ) the practicality of the resulting density acf, and suggest that a range of column density dynam ranges should be taken as a proxy for the actual dynamic range of the field, rather than a measure of the size of the individual density jumps.
we present newtonian hydrodynamic simulations of orbiting binary neutron star systems in the stable and unstable regimes. the simulations are carried out using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique. we investigate the stability of initial configurations that are tidally unstable as well as equilibrium sequences of co - rotating, equal mass pairs of polytropes. the dynamical stability of these equilibrium sequences is investigated by evolving them with a 2nd order accurate finite - differenced newtonalian hydrophynamics code. the calculation is carried out in a rotating frame that is initially coupled with the binary system. we are able to demonstrate that inertial frames which involve stars across the grid in the gas momentum equation can provide adequate angular momentum conservation for the orbiting and merging binary problems. in contrast, the use of a inertial laboratory frame together with a time - lagged gravitational coupling yields incorrect results. the inertial frame methods result in a substantial angular momentum loss that leads to a spurious inspiral of what should be a stable neutron star binary. we have found that a stable polytropic equilibrium sequence with an exponent @xmath0 is quite robust to deviations from idealization. we compare the results that are obtained using spherical and equilibrium initial data. while the results depend somewhat on the details of the adopted equilibration scheme, the spherical data are in very good agreement with the equilibrium sequences that are constructed using the iterative method of rai & shai. the comparisons that we have made between the equilibrium and spherical initial data using these methods reveal the similarities between them. however, the results of our stability tests indicate that the spherical equilibrium sequences are slightly more unstable than the equilibria. this is caused by a combination of time - lag and a gravitational acceleration that is coincident with the timescale of the inspiral. this fact suggests that angular momentum can be conserved in these models if one considers the effects of gravitational radiation losses on the equation of state of neutron star matter.
we study the dynamics of the gluon in the heavy - quark @xmath0 system, as a function of a suitably - defined interquark separation. we employ an approximate non - relativistic description of the combined longitudinal and transverse schrdinger equation, plus a variational treatment of the anisotropic harmonic - oscillator system. we obtain a gluonic energy of around 500 mev, which we compare to lattice data. the mass value is a little small compared to a typical lattice value, but certainly falls within an acceptable range of determinations of the mass. we show that there is a straightforward path from the fundamental elements of center - vortex qcd to a description of such a system variationally approximated by the wilson loop. # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

we present a study of the x - ray emission associated with a sample of nearby low and moderate inclination spiral galaxies, using h@xmath0 and mid - infrared images obtained with the acis - s instrument on the _ hubble space telescope_. we find a clear correspondence between the morphology of the diffuse emission and the current sites of massive star formation in the disks of these galaxies, as traced by the flux of diffuse x - rays correlated with that at other wavelengths, and by the mass and energy released by the massive stars and supernovae in the bulges. most but not all of the spiral galaxies show prominent diffuse spiral structure, coinciding with the sites of recent or recent star formation, as indicated by the high @xmath1 equivalent widths and large scale scale structure. however, in at least one galaxy ( ngc 3184 ) and in ngc 4303 and m83 ( m83 ), the diffuse component is not coincident with the active regions of star formation. we propose that the x / infrared flux ratio seen in the spiral arms is indicative of the average galactic fountain rate at these radii, and that the high mass and low scale height gas associated with the galactic fountain are tied to the disk rather than being part of a large scale outflow. if this interpretation is correct, it suggests that many spiral galaxies undergo a transition at some radius between thermal hot gas disks associated with galactic fountains and a more spherical distribution that might be associated with an active superwind. we consider three possible sources for the diffuse gas : ( 1 ) a star forming ring, ( 2 ) a galactic fountain, and ( 3 ) hot gas from an old bulge population that was driven by an supernova in the centers of the galaxies. the hot gas in the central regions of galaxies is generally optically thick, and cools very quickly ( a few kev ), leaving the gas relatively unperturbed by the environment. in the case of a starburst, the bulge could be heated by an agn event that has heated the gas and created a hot bubble in the center of the galaxy. the heat could also be released in a galactic wind.
the existence of sunspots is a mystery and their origin and evolution remains a mystery. there are many studies on the formation, growth and decay phases of sunspot groups based on the geometry and dynamics of the underlying large scale toroidal magnetic field structure. in this study, in order to understand and test these ideas, we solve the problem of magnetic induction equation for sunspot formation and decay by considering the source and sink terms separately. the source term is the one that enhances the magnetic flux of the sunspot and the sink term that attempts to destroy it. in particular, in the case of year 1955 - 1965, when the average area of a sunspot is @xmath0, its area increases and reaches its maximum area. on the other hand, as the age of the solar cycle(s ) and the maximum area ( at the end of solar cycle ) decreases, the area of thesunspot increases and eventually reaches its minimum. during these two years, _ viz. _, the rate of change of area is nearly gaussian and, at the beginning of each cycle, it is a linear function of the angle between the base of the convective envelope and the surface. while raising toward the surface, accumulate magnetic flux from the ambient magnetic turbulent medium and reaching the surface at different latitudes, the region of negative rotational gradient becomes more and more important for the growth phase. because of this, there are numerous variations in the area, area and rotation rates of theSunspots during it s existence and decay phase. we compare the results from our analytical solution with the observed radial profiles of rotation of the internal solar plasma that is computed from the helioseismology. we find that the observed gradient of rotation is fully consistent with the theoretical prediction ( alfven - gavet theory ). this means that there is no more than one rotational phase in sunspot s life time, that rotational gradients ( that in turn depends upon time ) grow and decay with a given power law. the last conclusion is also similar to the recent conclusion from a recent study ( hathaway and choudhary 2008 ) on the decay phase of solarspot groups. institute of geosciences, graduate school of science, pune 411 007, indian institute of technology, roorkee - 24701, india.
we analytically and numerically demonstrate that the condition of the metamaterial perfect absorber ( mpa ) is that the electric field inside the structure is a superposition of all orders of bragg waves. using a combination of analytical and numerical arguments, we show that even non - zero - orderbragg waves within the mpa consume electromagnetic energy. in agreement with the previous numerical observations, we find that the polarization current is strongly concentrated inside the metallic layers. for instance, the permittivity of the dielectric is described by a lorentzian function with @xmath0 $ ], where the term ` ` fundamental '' is interpreted as a periodic function of free - space wave number. the theory presented here provides a general framework for the understanding and applications of mpa. 99 n. engheta and r.w. ziolkowski, eds. _ ` ` electromagnetic absorption in thin films, '' proc. r. soc. lond. a * 7, * 1018010192 ( 2007 ). o.g. biebel, a.j. verma, j. van de groep, m.d. slater, s.a. kim, r. janicek, and l. kuipers, ` ` near - unity absorption in planar metallic structures, '' phys. rev. lett. * 105, * 213902 ( 2009 ). s.i. bozhevolnyi and y.s. kivshar, _ optical radiation from thin films to photovoltaic devices _ ( academic press, 2003 ), ( 19#2 ). p.k.l. chen, w.r.t. gao, q. yang, and z.y. zhiang, _ theory of electromagnetic absorption _ ( springer verlag, heidelberg new york tokyo, 2006 ). m.m. zheludev, y.v. dudin, makarov, d. v. kotlyar, and g. olshevsky, _ foundations of photonic crystal fibres _ ( imperial college press, 2012 ), [ 2]p.- h.- k. duu, l. yu. peng, t. liu, f.x. kang, xie, and x.- b. zhang, _ innovation in photonics _ ( world scientific, 2007 ), http://www
we report on the properties of the khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) detected with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) for the neutron star 4u 1636536. the star has a well defined innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ), and we find that the lower khz qpo has a significantly higher coherence width than the upper qpo, with a value close to half the stellar spin frequency. using a shift - and - add technique to minimize the contribution of long term frequency drift to the inferred values of the qpo width, we report the detection of a qpo at a frequency of 920 hz with a rms amplitude of @xmath0 mhz rms@xmath1 and a quality factor of approximately 1.01. for both qpos, the lower and upper qpos follow two different tracks in a diagram of quality factor versus frequency. the most striking change reported here is the frequency evolution of the coherence of the lower qpo. first, there is a shift in coherence from 600 hz to 850 hz, then to the present - day value of 940 hz. the quality factor decreases with frequency along the same track, and the frequency difference between the two qpos is about half the spin frequency or more. this result is difficult to reconcile with a drop in quality factor or coherence for a change in frequency, especially for rates as high as the observed one. the different quality factors also produce a frequency drop with increasing mass accretion rate, which would seem to imply that the frequencies are coupled. such a change would be difficult to explain with magnetic field effects ( e.g., a change of state ). we therefore suggest that the spin plays a role in setting up the frequencies, and that the magnetic field is probably strong enough to produce the frequencies. the system presents several constraints on models relating qpos to orbiting clumps.
the na44 spectrometer at the cern sps has been used to investigate the origin of protons emitted in relativistic heavy - ion collisions. pair - correlations of identical particles emitted in the collisions of two projectile particles, protons and sulphur nuclei, with different internal emission regions, were observed for the first time. the results of the two - proton correlation analysis are presented here in terms of particle number and source size. a one - dimensional description of the source parameters ( proton and projectile sizes ) using gaussian co - moving sources is used to quantify the correlation effects. the observed centrality dependence of the correlation function shows a decrease of the measured size with increasing proton momenta. it can be attributed to the combined effect of the final state interaction and fermi - dirac statistics as well as to the space - time development of the proton emission process. the analysed source sizes are compatible with the sizes of the lead and target nuclei. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 095 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2010 + * proton correlations at midrapidity in * + * collisions of pions and kaons at the sps * + _ submitted to eur. phys. j. c _ c. _ f.d. aaron@xmath0, m. aldaya martin @xmath1, k. alimujiang and v. arkadze + _ dipartimento di fisica, universit della repubblica, sezione di roma ` ` la sapienza '', + _ i.n.f.n., valencia, sp, brazil _ + _ cern, ch-1211 genve 23, switzerland _ + m.baumann, g.m. barnes, j.a. barnett, s. baroiant, w. bartel + _ theory division, department of physics, the weizmann institute of science, university of mnchen, + wolfgang - str. 1, 85748 garching, germany _ + e.s.c. bulge, joint institute for nuclear research, + ul. astr. soc., + 141980 dubna, russian federation _
we present a deep multi - wavelength survey of the stellar populations and ages of 283 virgo cluster disk galaxies, utilizing the magellan / gmos and atca / nicmos 2 micron all sky survey to investigate the properties of stellar populations as a function of galaxy morphology in a complete magnitude - limited sample of type ii galaxies. we find that 36 % of all disk galaxies with @xmath0 type ii characteristics exhibit statistically - significant u - shaped age profiles ( type i, ii and iii ), while the majority of the remaining galaxies exhibit type ii profiles which are either positive or flat. the mean age gradients for our type i sub - sample are flat, positive and negative, respectively. the distinction between these two classes provides a key step towards a definitive picture of many observable properties of disk galaxies : field galaxies experience radial migrations more often than field galaxies, and those in cluster environments preferentially host asymmetric disks, which is to say that dense galaxy environments favour the development of ` type ii '' disks. in the context of current galaxy formation models, our results imply that the three main classes of virgo disk galaxies are characterized by different evolutionary processes in dense environments : type ii breaks occur in nearly twice as many galaxies as type iis, while type iii disks are almost exclusively described by type iii profiles. our detailed comparisons of the ( projected ) cluster - centric radii for our entire sample shows that, despite global projection effects, virgo type ii is relatively insensitive to environment, suggesting that the type ii phenomenon is due to a balance between different physical processes in galaxies located in cluster cores and outskirts. this balance also provides support for the recent suggestion that type ii - ct breaks are a generic aspect of galaxy evolution, whilst the corresponding type iii breaks are associated with either a bar or disk asymmetry, thus explaining the observed correlation between the position of the breaks and age, or a combination of these. finally, our type ii / ii / iii statistics provide the basis for a new test of the predictions of current and future hydrodynamic disk formation models for which we provide relatively detailed comparisons against our observations. # 1to 0pt#1 [ firstpage ] galaxies : formation galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : evolution galaxies : photometry galaxies : interactions
the lovsz local lemma ( llll ) is a probabilistic principle which applies in many important contexts in combinatorics and statistics. a powerful extension of the lll is the _ lll - distribution _ ; namely, the distribution of the number of ` ` bad - events '', i.e., events which occur in a probability space @xmath0, conditioned on the presence of some overall weighting function ( _ lling function _ ) assigned to the variables. in this paper, we improve on previous results based on the _ mt algorithm _ ; we give a new method for constructing witness trees, which gives a more succinct and succinct history for when and how an event will come true during the execution of the swapping algorithm. this analysis is inspired by @xcite, which constructed similar ( but simpler ) compressed trees for the variable - assignment llll. we show that the mt algorithm can be extended to the case of permutations. for the permutation lll, we explicitly give an essentially identical bound on the mt - distribution as for the fmt - dist - simple lll distribution ( which is similar to the cluster - expansion lll criterion ). this bound holds even for complex events, and in fact it is stronger than the best - known lll criteria ( which are specialized to permutations ). related results are obtained for the event - neglecting lll and the latin transversal lll. we also show that if a bad - event has a sufficiently small number ( or even a positive probability ) of being true, then it is generally not a good event, thus tightly reducing the likelihood of encountering a bad event in that setting. we illustrate with new constructions of independent transversals, low - weight ( or weakly dependent ) substitutes for the fixed - sum of low - weights, and ( almost ) unbounded partial linslins. we make several applications of these results, including the solution to the max-@xmath1 problem and a variety of smaller problems in physics. finally, we provide a way to improve the analysis of either of the mt algorithms by taking advantage of the fact that the initial configuration of the variables ( which affects at most a small fraction of bad events ) is partially independent from the exact one.
we study the fisher information of an optomechanical system using the formalism of quantum estimation theory. in particular, we assess the usefulness of quantum fisher information for the inference of the parameters of a particular quantum system, focussing on cases where the variability of such a parameter due to quantum mechanics can be reliably estimated. we show that the variance associated with even the best measurement strategy for estimation of a parameter is too large to help ruling out the actual covariance matrix of the mechanical system. by contrast, local measurements on the state of the optical system at the steady state, using the quantum signal - to - noise ratio for estimation, can lead to a significantly smaller variance and thus to a higher sensitivity. these results are expected to be applicable to a variety of other quantum systems, such as josephson junctions. heisenberg hamiltonian is a cornerstone of many fields of physics. it describes a system of constants whose dynamical properties have been studied extensively, and is one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics. nevertheless, implicit in its scope is the theory of quantum measurement theory which is still somewhat ad hoc and often operates with without the knowledge or consent of the subjects to which it is intended to be applied. a prime example of such violation of local realism is the cramer - ro bound @xcite, which sets an upper bound on the precision with which a measurement of a physical quantity can be performed and thereby imposes a constraint on the value of that quantity to be measured. the aim of this paper is to examine the limitations of the theory in such cases. our approach is to identify the optimal quantum estimation procedure for such tasks, and to investigate the extent to which such information can be extracted from experimental data coming from various means. to this end, we compare the results from our method with the results of classical estimation theory methods, showing that the latter have limitations that are more tractable and under control.
we study the effect of multi - gap discrete surface solitons on the spectrum of transversally localized waves known as surface modes in truncated waveguide arrays, and present several characteristic examples. using the tight - binding approximation, we find novel families of discrete surface states that can be enhanced by several degrees of freedom, and we show their existence and stability. these surface states can be created either by a surface soliton that traps linear guided modes from other spectral gaps, or by a vector soliton with one or more major components from different gaps. in the first case, when the edge of the waveguide is truncated at the wide waveguide, we show numerically that linear surface states with staggered profiles can appear in the br gap ( known as the nonlinear tamm states ), whereas additional br gap appears for the other gaps ; however, the existence of the surface modes only requires the beam power to exceed a threshold value with respect to the region with a strong repulsive surface energy, and the lattice termination at the a or b site terminates at the either waveguide termination. in contrast to the case of narrow waveguides, where linear surface modes are always present in both the br and tir gaps, in the presence of a soliton - induced surface waveguide in the a - type waveguide the reduced propagation constant of the guided by one of the gaps is much higher than that of the corresponding tir gap states, indicating the possible maintenance of the interband interactions. for the two different cases, we also find regions on the surface of the soliton distribution that can support stable propagation for more than 100 coupling lengths.

we investigate the buchsbaum - rim multiplicity of a gorenstein local ring with infinite residue field. the multiplicity can be viewed as a generalization of the hilbert - samuel multiplicity. for a submodule @xmath0 of finitely generated submodules of rank 1, 2, 3 and 4, 1 can be a minimal reduction of the larger submodule if and only if it is a bourbaki ideal of the free semilinear module. in this paper, we give a new proof that for every finitely generate submodule of a local regular local ring ( _ i.e. _, for a cohen - macaulay local ring ) with maximal notion of ideal, we can find a corresponding ideal with the same colength. for arbitrary modules, we also establish a new result that the colength of an ideal linked to a complete intersection ideal is independent of the embedding of the submodule into a free module ; this result generalizes the result of j. watanabe on the four - fold multiplicities of three - dimensional rings. [ multiblock footnote omitted ] a.buchsbaum and g. rim @xcite first discussed the _ multiplicity that bears their names _ in 1964. they defined the multiplicit that is a linear combination of ideals from the polynomial of the identity matrix. later, g. ribordy, j. gaffney, kirby, rees, and kleiman and thorup studied the geometric theory that gives the multiplics of ideals related to polynomials. in particular, they used the noetherian local ring to prove that the gorkov multiplicity is a positive integer. the notion of positive integer has been greatly simplified nowadays ; monte - carlo simulations and computer simulations have efficiently provided many examples of positive integers. however, it is still a challenging task to find examples of non - positive integers when the dimension of the building block is not infinite. for example, consider the geometrically symmetric bipartite supergroup of two - dimensional regular rings. after the fact that the degree two is an integer, the complexity of the problem is limited to that for which there are infinitely many examples in the literature. the complexity problem can be understood in terms of the natural map from a local group to a free group. it is easy to see that a non - negative integer is a fundamental object in the theory of finite - dimensional linear groups. on the other hand,
we use archival vla observations in order to measure the linear and circular polarization of the ` radio flare'emission discovered from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) so far. we find that the linear polarization is significantly higher than that expected from synchrotron emission, and we derive an upper limit on this polarization of @xmath0-ray emission from the grb ejecta. the circular polarization is also significantly higher, and our limits are consistent with it being produced by the forward shock. we discuss the hypothesis that the radio flare emission is from the reverse shock and then cooled adiabatically, and find that this hypothesis is not likely to be the correct explanation for the observed polarization. finally, we show that the propagation effects in the host galaxy or circumburst environment are not significant enough to cause a significant depolarization of the radio emission. we obtain the following results : ( 1 ) for grb 990123 an ordered magnetic field is required. a sufficiently sub - dominant ordered toroidal magnetic field, together with a larger random magnetic field component, is sufficient to account for the polarization. ( 2 ) for another radio flare detection ( grb 020405 ), a magnetic field structure in the ejecta which is sub - dominated and orders of magnitude larger than that predicted from a purely toroidal field is needed. ( 3 ) when considered in the context of possible shock produced magnetic fields, the upper limits on the polarization are still consistent with the predictions of simple theoretical models that use inverse compton scattering of external photons, and are not significantly affected by propagation in plasma inside the source. ( 4 ) due to the small size of the source it is likely that no depolarizing effects are present. furthermore, since the observed level of polarization is a few percent of the total observed polarization, the polarization calibration used in this work is an optimal calibration for the system. this makes it possible to determine the intrinsic polarization of grb 021206 using only the observed afterglow emission.
we propose and analyse a new model of gold nanoparticle production in pp collisions. it is shown that in the low density limit, percolation of the clusters reproduces the observed behavior of the quantity @xmath0, i.e., the fraction of occupied area of the cluster, as a function of density. we compare the model with other models of interacting hard colliding binaries and with data of the correlation length of the particles. number of particles in the nucleus of a pp particle is proportional to the ratio of the first fm m particle density to the total area enclosed by the colliding box, denoted by the number of participants. event - by - event fluctuations of the particle density are observed to originate from the interaction of the nuclei of two nuclei with a smaller amount of particles than in the case of a single nucleus. as a result, one obtains that the total amount of produced gold nanoparticles depends on the parameters of the system. + the detection of particle fluctuations is one of the most important results of the hard core kaluza - klein computer simulation. analysis of the data supports the existence of two types of models for these particles. one is the schwinger model, in which each particle is associated with a different type of particle, the ` ` sea string ', and the other is the pajares model. + in both models, the coin distribution amongst the particles is gaussian. furthermore, in both cases, the problem of the distribution among the coins is treated as gaussian, allowing us to deal with a limited number of coins. per box. + we propose a third model, which consists of a gaussian distribution of coins, gaussian surrounding a few clusters, each containing only the valence strings, and percolating on each side of a nucleus. this model has been proposed as a possible alternative to the one consisting of gaussian distributions. + by comparing our models i and ii with data, it is clear that data prefer model i. it is also clear that, due to the small number of produced colliding particles, the model ii is correct, as long as it is found to be first order in the pp collision.
we present the kinematics of two populations of dust continuum clumps associated with star - forming cores in the perseus molecular cloud, which we identified across scuba 850 maps. one population ( with its density peaking at @xmath0@xmath1 ) comprises of starless, class 0 or class i protostars, whereas the other comprises of quiescent, class ii cores with orders of magnitude larger linewidths and virial masses. we associate each clump with a dust continuum source via the clump s distance ( rather than via clfind ) and use spitzer - like automated algorithms such as clfind and gaussclumps to extract the line - of - sight velocity dispersion, virial mass and ordered velocity gradient for each. the populations are compared with theoretical models and the results are used to constrain the turbulent state of the molecular cloud. in contrast to dense clumps in the nuclei of molecular clouds where turbulent motions are suppressed by thermal motions ( kolmogorov - smirnov shocks ), in the dense cores we find that the ordered velocity gradients are large and turbulent, with peak flux densities of 0.14k and 0.18k, respectively. we propose that these characteristics might arise from the combined effect of turbulent and magneto - rotational motions in turbulent clouds. in fact, in many dense cores at 1/2 the density of photons is similar to that in the clouds with comparable amounts of turbulent feedback. this suggests the presence of turbulent, subsonic turbulence in the cores we probe. taken together, our data indicate that dense cores with kinematic signatures can be the best discriminator between different models of core formation. turbulent motions in molecular clouds are thought to be caused by turbulent encounters between dense gas clumps and the interstellar medium within each core, rather than by the collapse of discrete cores.

we study the astrometric properties of binary components having an unresolved barycentre. in order to do so, we take into account two effects which have been neglected up to now in the study of binary systems : the local perspective ( ltt ), and the relativistic effects of the orbital motion. both of them are related to the orientation of the orbit in space. taking them into account, we find a solution for the barycentric perspective effect, from which we derive the angular coordinates of the point of view of the primary component in the local equatorial reference frame. this point is moving with the angular velocity @xmath0as and is located in an inertial reference frame with the help of the parallax. the component is then in a semi - major axis taylor - thiele - innes frame, in such a way that position is determined in the orbital frame by the position of the ascending node in the tangential plane. the orbital elements are then determined with the method of ` local perspective'( lp ). we check the reliability of the lp solution with numerical simulations, and we find that it can be practically compensated for the neglect of perspective acceleration and ltt effects if the binary is resolved, but still sufficient information is available to get an accurate value for the orbital parameters. the value of the latter is found to be about 2 % for unresolved binaries, and it is shown how to select the right ascending node for specific purposes. for binaries resolved in ( not too large of a distance, but in a sufficiently large one ( 5 - 10 pc ). unresolved binaries have much smaller values. we also show that the ltt effect is already compensating for the asymmetries of the binary orbit, and can compensate for the lack of an exact solution in some situations ( for instance, when the orbital eccentricity is large enough or the light travel time is short ). thus, unresolved binaries with large nt - effects are still viable candidates for the generation of very accurate binary stars. address = max - planck institute for astronomy, knigsstuhl 12, 69117 heidelberg, germany address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via bianchi 46, i-23807 merate ( lc ), italy address = astronomical observatory, centre de recherche associe au sens du sud, btiment 210, f-75014 gif sur yvette cedex
initiated by galaxy cluster mergers, the sz effect is a powerful probe of the evolution of the mass function ( mf ) of clusters of galaxies. here we examine the effect of cluster merger boosts on the mf in detail for a discrete set of high - resolution n - body / hydrodynamical simulations of mergers of clusters using the extended press - schechter / einstein - podolsky - rosen merger tree formalism. we find that mergers temporarily boost " both the integrated @xmath0 comptonization parameter and the integrated thermal energy density of clusters ( including the boosts that occur at the first sound crossing time of the clusters ). for intermediate mass ratios and impact parameters, the boosts in the maximum likelihood sz@xmath5 relation for clusters can be as large as an order of magnitude, although they typically last for about two sound crossing times. most of these boosts are smaller than the total increases in the total thermal energy of the merging clusters during the merger. thus, one can think of them as being a stage in the evolution from two separate equilibrium values, corresponding to the merger " value and not to the final merged value. overall, mergers do not significantly alter our estimate of the cosmological mfs. our results are in good agreement with previously published work, which predicted that the boosts could affect the estimation of the dark energy equation of state parameter, especially the most sensitive to the initial state density fluctuations of the gas, by up to 30 %. the boosts we find imply, however, that the overall normalization of the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations is likely to be overestimated by a factor of 2 - 3, even for the best - fit world - model or perturbative world model. for the case of an open " world model, our results suggest that possible boosts can lead to a 20 - 30 % overestimate of the mfs in the past for reasonable choices of world model parameters, while the bulk of the boosts themselves likely do not contribute significantly to this overestimate. we also find that the merger boosts can have a negligible effect on the determination of the amplitude of the thermal - energy distribution of the universe, though that result is dependent on the details of the merger histories of individual mergers and their frequency. in general, we are able to make relatively secure statements about the likely future evolution of clusters due to the upcoming large sample of clusters. in this regard, the only real uncertainty comes from the poorly constrained parameters of the underlying mf
we demonstrate automated wavelength tuning and stabilization of silicon photonic microring resonator ( mrr)-based filters. in - resonator photoconductive heaters ( irphs ), formed using doped waveguide sections, are used for both the sense and control operations, where the dark current flowing through the mrr is used for the sense ( sense - to - control ) and the on - chip photodetectors for the wavelength stabilization. we observe significant responsivity increases with the weight of the irph, which allows us to use higher - order series - coupled mrr filters for both sensing and stabilization. 10 m. born and e. wolf, _ principles of optics _ ( cambridge university press, 1999 ). k. srinivasan and o. painter, ` ` active control of the waveguide loss in an n - doped ring resonator, '' phys. rev. lett. * 102 *, 173601 ( 2005 ). h. s. kim, w. j. munro, k. nemoto, t. c. ralph, j. p. dowling, and k. l. pittman,``high performance photonic crystal nanocavity nanowire resonators for low power applications, '' opt. express * 15 *, 15471549 ( 2009 ). m. t. murphy, o. arcizet, r. rasmussen, and t. w. h. lee,``continued fast control of waveguide efficiency in silicon - on demand, '' ieee j. sel. top. quant. electron. * 20 *, 818828 ( 2010 ). f. cai and r. d. averth,``guide - star : a review of mid- and far - infrared topological features, '' appl. opt. * 43 *, r1750r1752 ( 2006 ). c. e. chiang, z. y. liu, l. chen, x. zhang, b. f. gao, and j. z. gong,``fast control of second - order photonic waveguide filters in the absence of defect state absorption, '' nano letters * 9 *, 24162418 ( 2007 ). j. takahara, s. hirota, y. kobayashi, h. yamagishi, a. ishida, and s. morioka, `
the two spiral galaxies ic 2163 and ngc 2207 are currently involved in a close grazing encounter. since the interaction introduced shock deformation in the plane of the galaxy pair, they have had several close encounters, spinning each other out of the plane and grazing each other. this paper describes the halos and dust features in the tidal tails of these galaxies and the structures and dynamics of the interaction. the interaction introduces shocks in the outer regions of the tidal arms and leads to star formation in the inner parts of the spiral arms. a new model of this interaction is presented, based on new _ hubble space telescope _ images. the hst images show that the tidal tail is driven outward from the plane by the overall motion of the two galaxies. the high speeds of the gas and dust lanes allow an improved understanding of the channeling of gas and stars in these galaxies. we show that a large - scale bar - like hydrodynamics can occur in the interaction, even if a genuine bar does not exist. there is star formation associated with a giant h i cloud in the far northwest, a region with only small h i clouds, and a dust lane that is perpendicular to the radio continuum source on the eastern side of an outer spiral arm. star formation extends to the south - west and the north - east of the radio source, where dense star clusters and young stars are found. the star - forming region of the dust lane is an oval with a high velocity dispersion of 30 - 50 km s@xmath0, similar to the inner - disk spiral arms of ngc 2535. we suggest that the interaction between these two galaxies triggered a starburst in which massive star clusters formed within the outer dust lane, transported themselves to the center of the universe and triggered the starburst. in the present model, the gas that forms in the dust lanes and the bar has an epicyclic rotation, so the episodic star formation will be distributed in a disk - like structure. there will be a central bar that will be present in the next few gyr. this is supported by detailed hydrodynamic simulations. the strong nonthermal radio continuum emission on the far western part of the western spiral arm indicates that the gas is moving out from the prograde region and will be accelerated on time scales of 1000 myr to a disk before the next @xmath1 yr, when the next star cluster will arrive. the gas will be compressed and warped by this next cluster will have its gas swept up. the
we present a study of the galaxy population in coma, a nearby rich cluster of galaxies, based on a deep 21 cm survey of the cluster with the vla. the survey covers an area of 1.2@xmath0 ( @xmath10.023, or z=0.023 ) around the center of the coma cluster and provides the most sensitive hi imaging of this region ever taken. we confirm that the hi properties of spiral galaxies in coma are very different from those previously reported for this cluster. we found that gas rich and gas poor groups of galaxies can be isolated in space and velocity, while groups associated with post starburst galaxies ( psbs ) are located closer to the center, in a zone roughly coincides with the x - ray emission. we detected two hi rich galaxies, ic 842 and ic 4088, and an interacting system, ngc 4922, located about 84 radii away from the cluster center. three hi poor groups are detected in field 5, associated with the spiral ic 40 88, after having been passed through the central region of coma. not all of the galaxies in the non detected group are hi deficient ; in fact, we find eleven new detections, all of them are located close to the outer edge of the hi disk. this suggests that even though coma is a rich cluster, the environmental effects are not yet at work. we also detected 287 kgc + kgc in the field of ngc 4858, known as the ` ` psb '' region ( dressedler et al. 1999 ). this is the first proto - cluster galaxy ( dressed as a psb ) to be detected in hi. except for two hi - poor groups, one of which has a hi mass of just above the local group. we suggest that the psbs in coma have been born in the group outskirts, where the hi is more exposed to the hot intergalactic medium and the ram pressure from the dense igm. other possible mechanisms, such as viscous stripping and conversion of hi to molecular gas, have also been considered.
we investigate experimentally the propagation of a single nematicon and the interaction between two nematicons in different layers of a planar biased nematic liquid crystal cell. we observe nonlocality, a characteristic feature of strongly nonlocal media, where the relative phase between the two beams is adjusted by the rotation of a 1.8 mm - thick parallel - face plate. the in - phase and out - of - phase interactions are shown to be independent on their relative phases. the influence of the boundaries on the interactions is evidenced by modulation of the relative polarization states of the two identical gaussian beams, which produce opposite polarization states in the plane normal to the cell but orthogonal to the molecular director. we also observe emergence of a giant reorientation in the direction along which the scattered light is at its half - maximum, providing an important tool for beam self - focusing. 10 f. scheffold and f. jahnke, ` ` optical solitons and localized excitations in planar nematics, '' j. mod. phys. * 38, * 15991617 ( 2002 ). f. ferri, l. nussenzweig, and h. krausz ` ` observation of birefringent uniaxiality and phase - dependent attraction and fusion of nematicos in bulk nonlinear crystals, '' phys. rev. lett. * 85, * 18631866 ( 2001 ). j. reithmaier, m. rhner, h. zull, f. schfer, a. forchel, p. knipp, and t. reinecke ` ` orientation - dependent modalities for the self - organization of bose - einstein condensates in nanocrystal heterostructures, '' nature * 424, * 833836 ( 2011 ). m. mazilu, d. j. richardson, and r. d. averitt ` ` assembly of large non - homogeneous deformable deformations in nematic nanocrystals, '' science * 292, * 304307 ( 2011 " ). t. tanaka, t. asai, k. takahashi, i. kobayashi, and s. kawakami ` ` design of bias - free nlc liquid crystals via nematic surface - plasmons, '' opt. express * 15, * 115401114 ( 2012 ). i. prez - hernndez, j.
the superconductivity in the body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) and face - centered cubic ( fcc ) phases of boron is studied using _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations. the electronic structure calculations are done using the full potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method. the phonon properties and electron - phonon coupling are calculated using the linear response method. we find that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 increases with increasing volume per atom in the bct phase and decreases with increasing pressure in the fcc phase. this behavior is also supported by the recently reported results of papaconstantopoulos and mehl, who indicated that fcc might be metastable for certain lattice parameters, using a formalism that is capable of reproducing phonon spectral function and phonon density of states data. the calculation of the electronic bands shows that the maximum value of the energy gap between the fermi level and the near - infrared symmetry point x - point is close to the value around 20 bohr@xmath1, indicating the existence of a body - center cubic phase. the calculated eliashberg spectral function shows a volume dependence that is in complete disagreement with the experimental data, since the volume dependence is the opposite of what is observed experimentally. the mean phonon frequencies show a higher phonon frequency variation with the pressure, in the range 4.6 - 6.0 a.u. for fcc and bct phases, in agreement with the recent linear response calculations by mailhoit and collaborators. the difference in the averaged phonon spectrum between bct and fcc phases can not be faithfully reproduced via a phonon - softening due to the different contributions of the modes of the high - frequency phonons. we also find that for the case of bct, the maximum of the hopfield parameter is about 10 - 15 times larger in fcc than in typical fcc, a fact that leads us to discuss the possibility of a second - order phase transition, which is not fcc. the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental results is the result of the very softening of the fundamental fcc pseudopotential, and not of the particle - hole splitting.
the multiwavelength spectrum of @xmath0-ray blazars shows two prominent broad bumps, the first one from radio up to optical- x - ray energy range, and the second one from x - rays up to at least 30 gev. it is usually assumed that the broad bump is caused by ` ` synchrotron self - compton '' ( ssc ) emission of relativistic electrons. it may be formed as a result of inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of low energy photons from radio to x -rays and of high energy protons and/or leptons in the soft radiation and magnetic field. the ssc model, applied to the data from last june 91 by bednarek & protheroe ( 1997c ), has been able to explain accurately the observed ssc spectra of two tev flares ( pks 1622 - 297 and pks 512208 ) on very short time scales ( a few hours ). however this model did not explain the longer time scale of the second bump and the fact that the energy spectra are considerably steeper in comparison to the low states. on the other hand, due to the homogeneous distribution of ssc emission in the jet, the supersonic response of the electrons is expected to be relatively constant during the entire flare time scale. this is in contrast to the large amplitude variations of the neutrino flux observed from gev to tev energies in the past few years. therefore the ` ` ` broken '' ssc spectrum observed from tev to gev may be attributed to new radiation from compact objects ( or to debris of close supernova explosions ) close to the surface of an accretion disk. we discuss four types of possible emission mechanisms : ( i ) pair production, ( ii ) colliding jets, ( iii ) cascades in the magnetic field of the blazar, and ( iv ) magnetic perturbations of the disk from the jet plasma. we favour the collision mechanism in most cases because for strong disk radiation field and slightly curved reconnection region the acceleration of electrons is controlled by their curvature energy losses. + * keywords : * bl lacertae objects : general - radiation mechanisms : non - thermal - gamma - rays : theory - ism : jets and outflows
we study the full counting statistics of a mesoscopic normal - insulator - superconducting ( @xmath0 ) junction in the limit of large number of modes and small transparency of the normal region between the two tunnel barriers. this limit only gives rise to small quantum corrections, as in earlier studies. we show that an uncorrelated, pair transfer mechanism is responsible for the zero energy counting statistics. due to the presence of the induced proximity gap, the probability of pair tunneling is strongly suppressed and the pair is thus emitted in a poisson process. this poissonian process is a consequence of the different phases picked up by the electrons and holes at finite energies. consequently, the pair transport is highly correlated. we also study the andreev channel picture which provides a simple explanation for the voltage and temperature dependence of the noise as well as the current. the rest of the paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the second cumulant, the noise within the reach of existing experimental techniques. + * keywords * : mesoscopic conductivity, superconductivity, and number counting
we rigorously calculate in 2d the temporal evolution of a dry spot under a single vapor bubble. the calculation is based on the solution of the full free - boundary problem for the bubble in the vapor - liquid interface. the bubble growth is assumed to proceed according to the power law @xmath0 for a given system pressure. the rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk is calculated by means of a simple two - dimensional problem of unsteady heat conduction in this wedge of liquid. the numerical error is substantially reduced with the increase of the time and space steps. another important region where the heat transfer becomes very large is the vicinity of the triple contact line. the heat flux through this hot spot is calculated. it is found that the size of the dry spot is very small with respect to the bubble size. at low system pressure the bubble can grow so fast that it accelerates the liquid supply to the boiling surface. however, the expansion of the bubble and its departure from the heater are both prevented by the liquid - vapor adhesion. the boiling crisis can thus begin with the creation of a small liquid droplet that thermally insulates the heater surface from the liquid. when the accumulated pressure of the liquid exceeds a critical value, the droplets leave the the heater. the situation is referred to as the ` ` boiling crisis '' because of the dramatic reduction of the boiling rate upon the arrival at the critical point. the important aspects of the problem are the following : i ) the growth of the fro - di liquid before the bubble nucleates at the equilibrium temperature with the liquid ; ii ) the process of liquid - bubble conversion since the bubble has grown to a sufficiently large size to avoid the departure. in this article we use the microlayer model that has been recently shown to be a very useful tool for the description of the nucleation and growth of vapor bubbles.
the ultra - high energy universe is teeming with energetic very high energy gamma - ray ( vhegr, @xmath0 ) sources, the extragalactic component of which mainly consists of tev blazars with a minority population of other sources such as radio galaxies and starburst galaxies. these sources are being used to constrain particle acceleration in the universe and to produce ultra - relativistic pair beams that propagate through the intergalactic medium ( igm ). in this series of three papers, we have studied the deflection of these pairs and the consequences of these pair beams on the thermodynamics of the igm. in the current paper, we calculate the amount of energy shed by vheghgr photons and their subsequent propagation through the universe in order to determine their impact on the structure and evolution of the universe at large. we find that the total energy density of these vherels is of order @xcite and that these photons are efficiently thermalized and converted into heat via plasma beam instabilities. using recent measurements of the gev photon spectral energy density, we argue that this heating can match the observed inverse temperature - density relation at high redshift without invoking the ` ` void phenomenon '', something which has been proven to be a problem for theories of reionization. however, the bulk of this heating comes in the form of kinetic energy which is not from the well - known ` ` bow shock '' mechanism. we propose an alternative mechanism for extracting the kinetic energy of the ultrarelativistic pairs that are produced, namely the so - called ` ` oblique '' instability. motivated by the results of paper i, we invert this argument and suggest that the observed high energy vherg photons may result from an instability of the plasma beam. we note that the oblique " instability is a promising mechanism for dissipating the excess kinetic energy originally produced by tev gamma - rays. in addition, this mechanism appears to be an attractive mechanism for producing pairs that can evolve over cosmological timescales without invoking a voids. this idea is supported by our recent analysis of the temperature history of the voids, which we have shown is consistent with observations that show optically bright and therefore young, groups and clusters are x - ray dim that is having a lower gas density due to a raised entropy floor. we also show that tevblazar heating suppresses the formation of late forming dwarfs both in galactic halos, i.e., the missing satellite problem
by means of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the role of stellar feedback in galaxy formation. stellar feedback is parameterized as a supernova explosion from a newly born massive star and a stellar wind from a dissipative dissipationly evolving star. we apply our models to the multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) in order to resolve the multi - phase nature of the interstellar medium. the ism has a high efficiency of star formation and the ultraviolet background is limited to its value at redshift 8. these metal - rich outflows can contribute to the enrichment of the halo and the inter - galactic medium. they are produced by turbulent motions driven by gravitational and thermal instabilities. however, these turbulent motions can only heat the gas up to @xmath0 k before dissipating. the result is the formation of super - bubbles and galactic chimneys. while a large fraction of massive stars are found in stellar clusters and associations, 10 - 30 % of them are ejected in the form of runaway outflows. these outflows have large velocity dispersions and are found to extend up to 100 kpc scales away from any molecular cloud complexes. the runaway ejection of the massive stars can help to maintain the galactic star formation rate. the subsequent thermal consumption of the stellar energy can produce a runaway flow of the gas with a high density and a low temperature. this runaway flow is fed by the feedback from supernova explosions and stellar winds and may result in extended galactic disks. we also find that the heating rate due to stellar feedback can exceed the cooling rate from radiative processes at the very largest scales resolved by the simulations. this large scale means that the dense gas associated with young and active stellar clusters can have very high densities, which may lead to galaxy formation via a mechanism called ` ` agn - feedback ''. finally, we stress that because of the high energy input from stellar feedback, the gas usually does not cool and therefore can not be re - heated at large scales, which is contrary to what is usually assumed.

we study statistics of local lyapunov exponents in low dimensional dissipative dynamical systems, focusing on the cases of fully developed chaos, and intermittency, where the dynamical correlations persist over long times. the analysis is motivated by the fact that such systems provide an additional and important dynamical characterization of the chaotic state of a system, and it is desirable to characterize the behaviour of such systems in a systematic way. our main results are as follows. for a wide range of dynamical attractors, including a variety of forced or nonchaotic dynamics, we obtain characteristic densities for finite time ( _ i.e. _ timescales which make the dynamics fully chaotic ) distributions which have characteristic forms depending on the nature of the attractor. we find that the distribution has characteristic forms which depend on the system, on the time interval over which the exponents are computed, and on the initial conditions under which the dynamics is chaotic. for example, for the commonly studied logistic map at the ulam point, for which we obtain an analytic solution of the distribution for all times, the characteristic density shows a marked departure from the gaussian form. this is indicative of significant finite size corrections to the multifractal formalism. we obtain the ( in principle ) exact expression for the probability density, and obtain an approximate form for an asymptotic approximate form of the density in the limit of infinite time. these densities are seen at all parameter values corresponding to interior crises, and thus are quite distinct from the usual gaussian density, which is associated with the dynamics. for intermittent systems, the distributions are quite different from the normal density, typically having exponential or stretched exponential tails. these tail tails are seen for all levels of additive noise, and are independent of the system parameters. we discuss the different types of distributions that can be obtained for finite times, and point out the important contributions that finite time les may play to the dynamics in situations where the system is forced quasiperiodically.
we present new color decompositions for the gluon tree amplitudes,, and for the quark - loop sector of one - loop amplitudes. we show that the new decomposition is equivalent to the kleiss - kuijf relation, in terms of chan - paton factors, and that it is therefore color - ordered. we obtain the color structures of amplitudes in the multi - regge kinematics, rather than traces. gluons in the loop are treated on an equal footing with fermions in the loops. the color - summed interference terms are computed for both of these sectors. in addition, we present new expressions for the square of the tree amplitude summed over colors. = 1.5 cm = -0.8 cm = 23.2truecm = 16.7truecm 30 pt plus 1000pt minus 100pt # 1 # 1= to # 1eq.

we calculate the optical properties of the surface plasmons of ag nanospheres embedded in different host media characterized by their permittivity @xmath0. we start from the time dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) for the dielectric response of the electronic density of ag in contact with vacuum, and include the effects of non - local surface screening and size quantization effects. the theory presented in this paper is able to account for the entire process of electron - hole pairs crossing the surface of a small particle. we find that the optical extinction cross - section of ag spheres of nanometric size is much larger than the size, implying that a quasi - static dipolar approximation is valid to calculate this optical quantity. we also study the quality factor of the resonance of these ag spheres. our results show that, when surface scattering is the dominant mechanism for the damping of their surface plasons, the width of the resonant component shows a trend with size different from that of the random phase approximation ( rpa ), which is related to the excitation of the metal - phonon coupling inside the particle. in ag spheres, the resonance has a maximum at a fixed size as a function of the frequency of the interaction between the particle and the surrounding medium, independently of size. the results obtained from our theory agree well with recent experimental results on ag nanoparticles coated with sio@xmath1, which indicate that the plasmon resonance in noble metal spheres is due to a collective mode broadening. 99 l. tong and e. wolf, _ computational electrodynamics : the finite - size view _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, uk, 2000 ). a. a. mie, a. v. sergienko, and y. s. kivshar, _ numerical calculations of the absorption spectrum of a single ag particle _ ( phys. rev. d, new york, 1998 ). w. p. grice, _ subwavelength effects _ ( springer verlag, heidelberg, 2009 ). d. stone, _ the particle theory based on the theory of abelian scattering _ ( oxford, 2006 ). i.v. krlikowski, p. petroff, l. kuipers, and t. gerrits, ` ` theory of the atomic nucleus contribution to absorption spectra of noble metal nanoparticles, '' j. appl. phys. b * 79 *, 245405 ( 2003 ).
we construct all three - charge superstrata solutions that can be parameterized by functions of two variables in closed form. the solutions with these functions either come from a five - dimensional ungauged supergravity or a six - dimensional supergravity with two or more tensor multiplets. this is a remarkable confirmation of the power of the approach we have been using to establish that there is structure that replaces the horizon of a black hole : we have directly constructed this structure in supergravity. the essential role for this fourth type of electric field in the solutions dual to the typical microstates of the d1-d5-p black hole is that it controls the shape of the angular momentum 1-form that controls the form of the closed timelike curves. from this construction we firmly establish that the superstratum solutions are not descendants of chiral primaries and that they are much more general than all the known supergravity solutions, all of which depend upon a variable. the microstate geometry we construct provides the basis for a new type of gravitational mechanism and, we believe, will be an essential part of the solution to the paradox. # 1_#1 _ = 0.1 cm = -2.5 cm = 23.2truecm = 16.7truecm 30 pt plus 1000pt minus 100pt # 1 # 1= to # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( # 2 ) # 3 # 1[#2]#3 phys. rept. * # 1*(#2)#3 @xmath0 e - mail : mr@astro.phys.utexas.edu _ keywords : _ supergravity, completely symmetric black hole, completely dissimilar quantum mechanics, superstring, fractal geometry 0.3 cm * a complete solution of the supergravity back - reaction problem *.5 cm w - y. pauchy hwang + _ department of physics and astronomy, the university of tokyo, kashiwa, chiba 277 - 8582, japan _.2 cm 0.2 cm
the purpose of a visual system is to sample light in such a way as to provide an actionable knowledge of its surroundings that will permit it to survive and reproduce. in most cases, this goal is achieved most effectively by highly regular point configurations in a highly regular array of photoreceptors that evenly sample incoming light to produce an accurate representation of the visual scene. however diurnal birds are one of the most sophisticated visual systems of any vertebrate, consisting of four types of single cone ( violet, blue, green and red ) and double cone ( red, blue and green ) patterns for color vision, involved in luminance detection. these individual cone patterns in the bird s retina are arranged such that cones of one type almost never occur in the near vicinity of other cones of the same type, suggesting that the photoreceptor patterns are _ multi - hyperuniform_. using a variety of sensitive microstructural descriptors that arise in statistical mechanics and particle - packing theory, we show here that the avian system possesses a remarkable type of correlated disorder at large length scales with a degree of regularity comparable to that of high - order crystals, quasicrystals and special disordered systems. furthermore, in a departure from any known physical system, we find that the patterns of both the total population and the distinct cell types are hyperunifiform, i.e., the system is multi -hyperuniform. we identify the cell arrangements that most likely correspond to the overall uniform sampling arrangement attainable in the overall pattern and the arrangements of the individual species as well as to the sum of the points associated with each species, providing evidence of the fact that the overall and individual species are as uniform as they can be, given the packing constraints within each species. we then develop a multiscale packing model incorporating such interactions and show that such a multiphase packing model may lead to point configurations that are virtually indistinguishable from the actual photoreceiver arrangements. * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * desy 10 - 165 issn 0418 - 9833 + july 2010 + * multi - paramento dell osservatorio astronomico di brera, universit della sapienza, + p.o. box 1415, 28850 - 2880 merate ( lc ), italy + @xmath0-department of physics, university of delaware, newark, deewell, ny 11794,
we present calculations of the effects of standard dredge - up ( in rgb and agb stars ) on the abundances of the light elements and, as well as on the yields of and. we have modelled these effects by a ` ` evolving rgb '' model, in which mass loss from low mass giant branch stars is captured during early main sequence evolution, and subsequently dredged up to the surface on the rgb, which is subsequently burned and injected into the interstellar medium via stellar mass loss. we consider a range of possible primordial abundances for,, and, taking into account the possible effects of different mixing speeds on the agb. the initial abundance we derive is the sum of deuterium ( @xmath0 ) and. in order to match recent observations of high lithium abundances in population ii stars, we have then reduced the low initial abundance to the present cosmic value. we find that the effect of extra mixing ( via ` ` cool bottom processing '' ( cbp ) '', which occurs when low mass stars undergo their first big bang nucleosynthesis, is to produce a heavy population of lithium - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars. these stars have abundances more than an order of magnitude below the present interstellar medium value, and thus they are predicted to be super - rich in. we do not find any observational evidence of this phenomenon in the low mass rgb stars studied to date, although we note that the low / ratio observed in some rgb stars may be due to a combination of poor mass resolution and small number statistics. our calculations suggest that the mechanism responsible for enhanced rgb abundances may be related to the very low circulation speeds actually observed at the tip of the rgb. this mechanism can thus naturally explain the high observed baryon to photon number ratios and the anomalously low metallicities of some rgb - low stars. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # = = = 1=1=0pt1 # 1 # 1/#2.1em.5ex-.1em /-.15em.25ex ps. 2 3ps 3 3 [ firstpage ] stars : abundances stars : agb and post - agb
we present a study of the mid - infrared properties of galaxies in a representative sample of 30 massive galaxy clusters at @xmath0, taking advantage of recently obtained panoramic _ spitzer _ mir and ground - based near - infrared ( nir ) imaging. we use our large sample to both reduce systematic uncertainties on the photometric selection of cluster members, and to overcome the strong dust - obscuration in cluster redshifts previously identified in comparative optical / infrared studies. using the butcher - oemler effect as a constraint on the evolution of the cluster galaxy population we find that the fraction of massive cluster galaxies within the redshift range covered by access ( a complete census of star - formation and nuclear activity in the shapley supercluster ) remains unchanged over the past 5 billion years. globally, our results agree with previous studies which have shown that there is little evolution in the structure of the clusters, as the infall rate of field galaxies is expected to remain relatively constant out to redshift. however, when we restrict our survey to the central region of each cluster we find a radial dependence of the inferred cluster - to - cluster scatter that is half the value seen in previous studies. this scatter is likely due to a combination of our use of nir data to select cluster galaxies, and the different physics that is at play in the local group environments within which galaxies arrive in the clusters. in the context of this simple infall model we argue that the observed trends in the cluster redshift sequence, and in particular the fractions of massive star - forming galaxies, can be interpreted as resulting from the passage of infalling galaxies from the field, which are accreted onto the clusters at a constant rate before being quenched by cluster - related processes. even when we allow for a global decline in the star formation rate though the infall, the residual redshift evolution seen in some clusters, after correcting for the environment - dependence in the infall inferred from our nir selection, suggests that some moderate level of local dynamical processes ( e.g. ram - pressure stripping ) may play a role in shaping the properties of the majority of cluster galaxies. galaxies : clusters : general galaxies : formation cosmology : observations
we demonstrate that the structure of a photonic crystal fibre ( pcf ) can dictate the frequencies of light that can be generated by spontaneous four - wave mixing ( fwm ). by cutting an inhomogeneous pcf 0.25 m in length, the fwm jsis can be mapped to determine the length scale of the structure variation. we develop a numerical reconstruction technique to reconstruct the jsi of each segment with an appropriate phase applied. finally we use the set technique to estimate the level of structural variation in pcf. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 j. c. knight, ` ` photonic crystals : the future of photonics, '' nature * 424 *, 847851 ( 2003 ). s. d. liew, p. s. j. russell, and d. n. christodoulides ` ` fibre - pumped supercontinuum single - photon sources, '' opt. lett. * 22 *, 856825 ( 2004 ). y. zhao, j. f. roddier, and t. a. baehr - jones ` ` pump - tunable, ultrafast multiple - photon source on demand, '' ieee j. quantum electron. * 29 *, 13671370 ( 1995 ). a. h. gnauck, r. m. jopson, and j. vu@xmath0 lab, " j. phys. : condens. matter * 6 *, 663674 ( 1998 ). j. b. pendry, d. r. smith, and w. joger, a new high - intensity source of heralded single photons, " in _ progress in quantum optics _, e. wolf, ed., vol. 44 ( elsevier, amsterdam, 2003 ), c. cohen - tannoudji, w. helwig, and x. du, tunable single photon source with all - optical dispersion in spontaneous downconversion, " phys. rev. b * 74 *, 183601 ( 2007 ). t. udem, s. holzwarth, h. weinfurter, and a. zeilinger, discovery of single photons in heralded down - converted pdc quantum - state, " quantum electronics * 36 *, 951 ( 2008 ). m. holleczek, a. widera, f. grazioso - juan, and m.
we show that the group of mbius transformations is the key to understanding this class of dynamical systems. our analysis generalizes the previous treatments of josephson arrays and the kuramoto model, and clarifies the geometric and algebraic structures responsible for their low - dimensional behavior. one spin - off of our approach is a new set of constants of motion ; these generalize the constants found previously, and hold for a wider class of oscillator arrays. the reduced flow lives on a set of invariant three - dimensional manifolds, arising naturally as the so - called group orbits of the unit disc to itself. the results obtained in this way are then compared to previous findings and explored in detail. we further explore the dynamics on the invariant manifolds using the generalized cross - ratio construction. the resulting equations for oscillator array are filled with chaos and island chains, reminiscent of the pictures encountered in hamiltonian chaos and kam theory. the theory developed here was originally motivated by simulations of the governing equations for a series array of @xmath0 identical, overdamped junctions driven by a constant current and coupled through a resistive load. we call such systems _ coupled oscillators _ because the dependence on time and on any other auxiliary state variables in the system ( time - dependent or quasi - time dependent ) plays an important role in the interpretation of their results. we adopt a geometrical perspective and show that it answers several questions of the dynamics, including : why is the physics of oscillators hard to understand? how can we reduce the number of parameters of the system, and which are the appropriate values for the various variables? the answers are found by investigating the corresponding dynamics on different manifolds. we also show that a particular family of transformations is special, because its equations exactly follow the exact solutions for other teams of equations.
we present a study of the composition and the optical properties of dust grains in the coma of comet hale - bopp using both the infrared emission spectrum and the degree of linear polarization observed by the infrared space observatory. we formulate a dust model for the protoplanetary disk in which both size and shape effects are taken into account. in contrast with previous studies, we employ a method where the shape dependence is replaced by time - dependent radial mixing. in this method, the effective radius and variance of the size distribution of the dust grains are determined self - consistently. we find that the minimum size for the crystalline silicates is @xmath0@xmath1, while the largest grains are predominantly submicron sized. this difference between the size distributions of crystalline and amorphous silicates leads to a relatively low overall abundance of crystallate silicates. the large grain size is necessary to reproduce the spectral features of the long wavelength part of the spectrum, as it would lead to an overabundance of large ( 1 - 10 microns ) crystalline carbon. the shape distribution of our dust grains is consistent with that found in interplanetary dust particles and meteorites. as a result, we are able to use the same dust parameters and shape for all dust components and obtain a better constraint on the composition of cometary dust than previous studies. a temperature sensitive model of the solar nebula is presented in which the essential ingredients ( dust composition, crystallinity, size distribution, and composition ) are determined simultaneously. it is shown that thermal annealing and radial mixing are more efficient mechanisms to crystallize dust grains than are thermal shocks and shocks. due to the high temperature content of the comet comets, the local crystallinity is required to produce the correct dust properties in the outer solar system. an extremely well mixed nebula model is used to fit the observed crystallinity and the mass absorption coefficients of the interstellar radiation field as a function of distance from the comet. the model predicts a final crystallinity in the comet - forming region that is independent of the distance. the physical processes responsible for crystallization are discussed in terms of the different ages of the nebula and the time structure of the photosphere.
we describe a numerical method for identifying the production of kink - antikink pairs, i.e., pairs of lattice quasiparticles, in one - dimensional field theories. the method is based on the lattice - spacing dependence of the one - loop effective potential in a lattice formulation of the theory. it involves the addition of a ( finite ) counterterm to the tree - level potential in an existing lattice simulation. the corrected effective potential introduces lattice distortions which are linear in @xmath0, in contrast to the use of the ` ` bare '' potential in most previous works. the effects of these nonperturbative lattice spacing distortions are discussed in detail, with emphasis on how they affect the production count of pairs. we find that for temperatures below a critical value, the derived results are in agreement with experimentally determined values. in a subsequent paper, we intend to extend the method to finite - temperature field theories, and to study the discrepancies found in the numerical simulations for fairly low temperatures. the kinks in the discretized quantum gas of white, langevin, and white @xcite have been a subject of considerable interest in the condensed - matter physics community. in order to understand the nucleation of these kinks, one would like to know their density, the density of pairs, and the mass ratio. one way of approaching these quantities is by performing lattice simulations of a scalar field with a known classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem. this provides a way around the problem of dealing with ultra - violet lattice spacings, which are known to destroy numerical effects in 1-dimensional quantum gases. the main difficulty in understanding the origin of these effects lies in the identification of kinks. it is generally assumed that the number of pairs formed in a simulation is proportional to the amplitude of the fluctuations near the two minima of the potential ; however, the reliability of this assumption is not well established. apart from very coarse lattice grids, it is also not clear how large- or small - lattice lattices spacing must be for a theory to be consistent with the large-@xmath1 results found experimentally. previous numerical studies of single - qubitknot production have focussed on large - scale lattice dynamics, whereas relatively little attention has been paid to the smaller lattice properties that are relevant for low - dimensional theories. in the present work we address this deficiency by introducing a systematic reduction of the effective potential by using a properly corrected potential in the
we present new hubble space telescope / advanced camera for surveys spectroscopy and imaging for the three massive galaxy clusters ms0451.6 - 0305 at @xmath0, rxj0152.71357 in the central region of the einstein extended medium sensitivity survey ( ems ) and rx j1226.9 + 3332 in the outskirts of the coma cluster to establish the fundamental plane ( fp ) scaling relations for the galaxies in these clusters, as well as other scaling relations as a function of redshift and galaxy mass. the fp is a tight empirical relation between the effective radius, the mean surface brightness within that radius, and the central velocity dispersion. we find that the zero point zero point varies with redshift 0.75 - 0.45 leading to the question of how to correct for this ` ` progenitor bias. '' the sample of galaxies at the highest redshift for a recent study by van dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) is dominated by passive evolution galaxies, while the galaxies at lower redshifts tend to evolve more strongly towards the red sequence. with the present paper we characterize the stellar populations and kinematics of the three clusters and evaluate the effect of differences in the imf slope and abundance ratios for the massive galaxies compared to the low redshift comparison clusters. we establish the correlations between the line - index properties and the galaxy velocity dispersions ( measured from the central velocities ) for the clusters and compare them with the single population synthesis ( ssp ) models. the line index measurements in the high - mass end - points of the clusters are consistent with the ssp models and the lower - mass galaxies in the low - redshift clusters supporting a passive evolution scenario. the difference in slope indicates that galaxies at high redshift are forming at a higher formation redshift than lower redshift counterparts, while at the same time galaxies are crossing the line of sight towards the low mass end of the mass sequence. we discuss the cluster environment in connection with the star formation and the evolution of the galaxy populations.

in this paper, we use a ginzburg - landau theory to explore the first order paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition in ising - like ( re = ho, dy ) materials at low temperatures. we find that the main features of the pm phase diagram of these materials can be described in a transverse field ising model if the applied magnetic field is parallel to the ising direction along the @xmath0 axis of a hexagonal unit cell ( re)@xmath1 hexagonal lattice ( dy ). in this case, the presence of a griffiths - mccoy singularity ( gms ) on the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange lattice can be shown to play an important role in describing the unusual properties of the phase diagram. we also show that the heisenberg uncertainty principle is required to describe the gms in the case of the non - kramers ( ho ) variants of the fm. in view of the experiments, we assess the feasibility of characterizing the zero temperature critical transverse magnetic field,, by means of a monte carlo study. we show that if the critical temperature is much higher than the value predicted by the theory, then the spin glass phase can be destroyed through strain - induced random transverse fields. this leads us to explore other, analogous to the gm, phenomena that occur in amorphous, rare earth hydroxides with large hund s exchange interactions. in the absence of large, single crystal solutions, the spin - glass phase is destroyed through gms due to random ( electrostatic ) crystal field effects that compete with the collective spin glass behavior. 2pcm^-2 2cm^2 # 1#1 materials exhibiting unusual behavior in zero temperature phase diagrams have attracted considerable interest @xcite. in particular, there are materials that display considerable experimental interest, even though no large single crystals of their series are currently available. one peculiarity of the periodic table ( table ) is that the ground state of the system is not accessible. although experimentalists and solid state chemists may be able to conceive ways to create individually smaller crystals of the material, the destruction of its ground state, if any, is obviously a necessary step to pave the way for an unambiguous quantum phase transition to occur. quantum phase transitions are believed to occur in a large variety of condensed matter systems including many metals and superconductors. for this reason, much attention is currently being given to ising
we present results of deep 3.78@xmath0 m @xmath1 observations of the trapezium cluster ( m7.8 ) using the eso vlt. the observations extend the previously obtained 3.5 @xfig0 m vlt observations of lada et al. ( 2000 ), who used the vlt to determine the frequency of infrared excess emission in an area 5 x 5 from the main cluster. in addition, we have obtained several hundred images of the cluster region with the 3.7 m telescope of the very large telescope ( vlt / vlt - vla ), to search for spectroscopically selected substellar candidates and to study the substellar population. combining these data with previous observations we report the discovery of a significant population of extremely young, deeply embedded, extremely heavily reddened objects. seventy - eight sources are new members of the highly reddened population and forty - eight are new identifications. the spatial distribution of these red objects is significantly different from that of the previously identified heavily buried protostellar candidates in this young region. a high excess fraction of infrared emission is found for the cluster membership and a low excess / disk fraction is determined for the deeply embedded population. together, these observations indicate that this population represents a significant fraction of the sample of objects in the very young and heavily evolved stage of cluster formation. we derive an infrared excess of 50 @xwwwxmath2 20 % for the totally circumstellar disk fraction. this fraction is consistent with the excess observed for other stellar populations in the cluster, although we can not exclude a significant excess for the embedded source population. we also analyze the implication of these observations in the context of disk models and demonstrate that the presence of circumstellar disks plays a significant role in some of the observed structure in the background density distribution of the relatively young deeply embedded objects. we find that the spatial extent of the deo distribution is coincident with the primary peak in the overall cluster distribution and thus with the location of the most recent and active star formation activity in the orion nebula region.

the dynamical system of the dts-@xmath0 ( dynamic transition of spherical couette flow ) is studied by means of a principal component analysis. the flow is decomposed into individual spatial modes, each with its own timeseries ( @xmath1 ). the modes are chosen to maximize the cross correlation in time between different measurements ( _ i.e. _ the kinetic and magnetic spectra at each radial gridpoint, respectively ), and the analysis is carried out in the frame of the inner sphere. since the outer sphere rotation rates are saturated, the flows are best studied at the inner and outer radii, where the elsasser number is weakest, and where the applied field is strongest. some nondimensional parameters ( ` ` magnetic diffusivity '', ` ` magnetization '' ) are introduced to characterize the flows at different radii / rates, and their values / ranges are compared with the values of the machine.

the power spectrum of emission from black hole binaries is variable on both long and short timescales, and can be well described by a model in which the entire emission spectrum is a superposition of thermal fluctuations in a hot inner flow and comptonised ` ` tail '' outside the black hole. this model can explain the broadband noise as arising from mri fluctuations in the inner flow, and the broad band noise as resulting from lense - thirring precession of the disc by the accretion flow. a detailed power spectral analysis shows that the signal is composed of a broadband noise continuum, with a low frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( lf qpo ) superimposed on this. the power spectral evolution of this feature is also tightly correlated with the evolution of the spectral state of the flow. both bhbs and neutron stars show the same low frequency qpo frequency as they now occupy the same range, with qpo frequencies increasing from 0.1 - 10 hz at low to high luminosities. we show that this similarity can be understood if the low frequency break and qpo are both associated with the inner disc truncation radius. in this scenario, the order of magnitude variations in the mass accretion rate originating from the tail are set by the viscous timescale, and are independent of the geometry of the outer flow.

we study the x - ray emission from late - type stars using the rosat / pspc and yohkoh / sxt data ; we have translated the solar observations into a context homogeneous to that of stellar observations. from these data we have determined the coronal temperature and the corresponding emission measure distribution, and studied the evolution along the solar cycle for stars of different activity levels and spectral types. on the one hand, we find that late type stars cover the same region of the solar corona as active stars ; on the other hand, they span a diagonal strip, with widths ranging from -1.0 to 0.0 and f@xmath0, that bisces the levels of most active stars. we then study the contribution of various coronal structures ( flares, small flares, large flares ) to the solar coronae and, in particular, coronal loops, at various stages of their evolution, from emergence to decay. our approach allows us to tie directly, with just one data set and interpretation, the vast amount of data collected with the two aforementioned observatories. also the data set has an extended time coverage, hence we can apply it for studying the solar - stellar connection in x - rays. we find the same result for the whole sun as it would be expected from the _ combined _ data from rosat and some additional stellar data already published in different contexts ; our approach provides a global perspective on coronal structure. the different levels of active and inactive activity are found to be found in all stars, with the least active stars spanned by the largest gap ( i.e., the ones with the lowest surface flux ). all the stars, in the mean activity level range, show a correlation between surface flux and hardness ratio of up to @xmath1, in agreement with previous results ; also the correlation with temperature seems to hold during the moderate to large flares. we interpret this result in terms of coronal loop scaling laws, which have been proposed as a way to connect the different stages of a solar - like structure on a stellar surface ( from active to inactive ).
the cross - section for the subprocess, denoted by @xmath0, is measured using the opal detector at lep. this subprocess consists of the decay of a quasi - real photon into a pair of fermion pairs. the differential cross - sections are obtained using the equivalent photon approximation in a restricted phase space, like the invariant mass of the quark - anti - quark system. the results are compared with the predictions of different monte carlo generators. european organization for nuclear research cern - ep/2006 - 038 + 18th october 2006 + * real z production in * 1.5 cm * * p. golonka@xmath1, d.h. jenkovszkow jin, k. karev, v.i. kolesnikov, m. kowalski _ + _ institut fr theoretische physik ( t39 ), physik - department, + technische universitt mnchen, giessenbachstrasse 2, 85747 garching, germany _ _ _ laboratory of theoretical physics ( cern, ch-1211 genve 23, switzerland ), 2.8 mb einstein - galilei, + _ theory department, james madison university, + hann wolfgang goethe - universitt, + jadranska 19, 8057 jadronska, poland _ _ cavendish laboratory, university of cambridge, + cambridge lane, cambridge cb3 0he, u.k. _ _ operated by the american institute of physics, johansson building upon albert einstein s idea of the cosmic beam, see figure [ fig : zeefeyn ] @xcite. the primary production site is the cern ps, located in the bowen complex, close to the large hadron production bremsstrahlung, and one of the main sites of the relativistic heavy ion physics program, is the tevatron. in the last few years the closure of the loop around the central engine has been achieved by the operation of a few fb ram and the consequent consequent increase of the luminosity of the detector, with the aim of measuring the number of produced hadrons. this process is expected to be the dominant source of real z bosons. up to now, several publications have focused on the properties of the reaction and the parameters used to determine the parameters. in this
using three contiguous narrowband filters ( nb466, nb470, and nb475 ), we have carried out a narrowband survey for lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) at redshifts of 2.82.9. our spectroscopic followup observations revealed a large scale structure at @xmath0=2.8 which is indicated by a peak in the redshift distribution of laes in ecdfs - s field. we show that this large - scale structure consists of 4 protoclusters, whose overdensities within a radius of 5 mpc ( equivalent comoving volume = 7.5mpc@xmath1 ) have been estimated from the coadded spectrum of the confirmed laes. from the stacked spectrum, we find that the lae candidate galaxies have specific star formation rates ( sfrs ) ranging from 1.7 to 16 m@xft/yr, with a median value of 9 m@ft /yr. the observed lae numbers span a range from 9 to 12, implying galaxy - to - galaxy varying overdensity ratios of 4.4 4.6. the overdense region contains more galaxies older than the void regions, implying that the protocluster complexes with no agn are more massive and possibly less dusty than the ones with one or more agn. the average rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity function ( lf ) of the laes without x - ray detections is consistent with the lf in the blank field field of calzetti et al. ( 2006 ), which is known to be a good indicator of star formation rate ( sfr ) in the local universe. by excluding low - z interlopers and low - metallicity galaxies, we get a complete sample of 179 laes ( 96 with detections in the f555w, f814w, 47w, and f828w f849w f614w non - lense - sb(chandra ) _ chandra _ uv telescope _ and _ galex _ in collaboration with eso / goods. the luminosity functions and star - formation rates show a consistent trend with the general galaxy evolution with redshift. the difference between the ly- and uv - based sfrds can be explained by the fact that the global ly - ray escape fraction is constant in all the surveys that could be considered, and increases with the distance to the cluster. covering the entire sky, the ly
recent observations indicate that the ` ` standard '' rotation - activity connection, observed in f5 to m8 dwarfs, breaks down in the late m dwarfs. the chromospheric and coronal activity levels in these objects are, in spite of being rapid rotators, substantially higher levels of activity. we investigate the possible reasons for this breakdown, focusing on the regime in which the field is strongly coupled to atmospheric motions. for stars later than f5, we calculate the magnetic stresses generated by photospheric fluid motions, which we assume to be generated by a weakly rotation - dependent turbulent dynamo. we show that the output of such a dynamo is far too small to produce any significant field. instead, we find that activity is largely decoupled from the magnetic field over the entire stellar surface, but still generates a significant field in the uppermost atmospheric layers. the magnitude of this non - potential field depends sensitively on the ratio of the stellar rotation period to the convective overturn timescale, and rises sharply with decreasing rossby number ( @xmath0 ). this behavior is in stark contrast to that of the, which, as noted by radioflaring studies by meyer & hyer, is also dominated by a dissipative mechanism involving the thermal motion of small - scale magnetic structures. we calculate acoustic fluxes as well in the range of interest here, and compare them to the observed fluxes. the saturated levels in the m9 dwarfs are in very contrast to those observed in the l dwarfs ; these dwarfs exhibit very low activity levels. we suggest that this is because magnetic fields are stronger in the interior than in the corona, where coronal motions are more efficient. this picture also explains the observed decline in activity in thel dwarfs as a result of the decline in the coupling between field and rotational velocity.
using hydrodynamical simulations of interacting pre - prepared disc galaxies of comparable masses, we investigate the chemical evolution of the baryonic content of the interstellar medium during high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) interactions. we assume that supernova explosions ( sn sn ) feedback is generated by stars more massive than 8 m@xmath1 after the first close encounter. we analyse the response of the gas - phase oxygen abundance to galaxy interactions, varying orbital configurations, star formation and sn feedback parameters and initial gas fraction in the form of a gaseous disc. in less gas - rich simulations, we find that a low - metallicity gas inflow developed during the initial close passage dilutes the central oxygen abundance and triggers mass - loaded starbursts at the first and second pericentre. we also find that this gas - dilution is a consequence of the on - going important star formation activity triggered by the first central starburst, which is not observed in gas - poor interactions. gas inflows from the outer regions of the disc have been driven into the central regions during the first quiescent and early starburst phases and are quite oxygen - rich up to 50 per cent. we observe an increase of the oxygen - to - iron abundance ratio [ o / fe ] within a sphere of radius 2 kpc. this suggests that the decrease of the central abundance could reflect principally the change of the self - gravity of the galaxies and/or a reconfiguration of the galactic potential well. taking the well known result of simi as an example, we compute the central abundances in the range from 1 kpc to 10 kpc as a function of the interaction stage in order to assess the chemical changes in interacting galaxies at different stages of evolution. although previous works have shown that galaxy interactions can significantly dilute the oxygen abundance in the central region, such as in the case of galaxy pairs, by using the observations it is difficult to discriminate the effects of the interactions on the global oxygen abundances.

we use photoionization models with cloudy atoms to study the effect of stellar continuum pumping on the intrinsic hydrogen abundances in gaseous nebulae. cases one and two are taken to be the irradiated analogs of the classical optically thick case c, while case three is treated as a variation of the more well - known case b. in this variation we find that the relative fluorescent intensity predicted depends on the aperture size, in a way that depends crucially on the spatial distribution of stars and the gas around them. this deviation from case b could be attributed to the fact that in the vicinity of the stars, continuum pumping provides a source of balmer photons comparable to recombination. if the gas is optically thin, recombination and fluorescence act concurrently in the whole volume, so the total emissivity in ly@xmath0 is largely enhanced by the latter mechanism. we discuss how the spectral and spatial features affect the nebular emission, and we argue that, in particular, the geometrical shape and/or the fractiony fraction of high - ionization stars make it impossible to derive definitive predictions for the fluorescence intensity in h ii regions. on the other hand, the more complicated geometry of the stellar spectral energy distribution makes it difficult to distinguish between the fluorescent and the recombination excitation mechanisms, even if continuum pumping has no other effect on the structure of the nebula. we suggest that future high - resolution spectroscopic observations will help to clarify the influence of these spectral features on the actual emission. in the process, we also demonstrate that the standard stellar wind model, which neglects fluorescence, is grossly overestimated, and that a proper modelization requires inputting higher - resolution synthesis models into the @xmath1-band synthesis code.
we develop a quasispecies model of cellular evolution that takes into account the single - stranded dna repair ( sos ) mechanism, which is a genomic repair mechanism that only activates when there is extensive genetic damage to the cellular genome. since the sos repair mechanism is highly error prone, we believe it is important to include error correction mechanisms in the model, and we develop a simple model that takes this into account. we consider a population of asexually replicating organisms, whose genomes consist of a single dna molecule, i.e. one chromosome, and assume that the genomes of the organisms in the population are characterized by a small number of mutations, each of which is expressed as a sequence length, @xmath0. when the mismatch in one of the two bases of the dna strand is removed, the inherited genome is unvirialized, and its stability is then determined by the fitness landscape of that population. we use stochastic simulations to determine the fitness penalty for having a non - viable genome. when this fitness penalty is sufficiently great, dna proofreading and mismatch repair seem to confer a maximum selective advantage over dna replication. in addition, in the limit of infinite genome length, we find that error - free daughter strand synthesis is the optimal strategy for conserving complementarity, and that mismatches in the genome can be removed quickly, thus preserving the complementarity of the population. error correcting mechanisms that are active during the replication of dna have a small chance of being detected by analysis of the available data on the _ fitness landscape _, namely, the probability of a mismatch in a matching in a given genome at a given the sequence length. therefore, for example, when the per - genome replication fidelity of a laecesis population is sufficiently high, it is not worth exploring the data in order to test the model. _ our model, _ which describes the cellular population as consisting of a clonal population of wild - type ( mutation - free ) genomes, is simple enough to be analytically tractable, yet complex enough to provide a useful starting point in understanding the mechanisms of cellular error correction and genomic repair.
we present a proof - of - principle experimental description and working principle for the fabrication and characterization of a cylindrical geometrical - phase lens ( gpl ) based on a birefringent half - wave plate having a transversely space - variant optical axis ( ` ` pancharatnam - berry phase '' ). in such a device, at each point in the transverse plane, the light polarization is made to change continuously along a given path on the poincar sphere, by the action of a suitable local medium anisotropy. this can be either from modulations of the thickness of the optical element, as in shaped glass lenses, or from a sequence of polarization transformations induced by the transformation of the structure of the incoming light beam. the working principle is based on the solution of a well - known equation for the time integral of the ( slowly varying ) refractive index divided by the reduced planck constant, which is the simplest analog of the born - oppenheimer approximation. the gpl is also electrically tunable, as if different polarizations are used at input, one obtains a complex polarization transverse structure in the output of the lens. in our prototype gpl, light that passes through the center of the plate is circularly polarized ( with the polarizations going in and out of the plane of the optic axis ), and the output is also polarized with the opposite sign ( opposite - handedness of the polarization ). by contrast, in the present structure, the input polarization is linear, but with a variable phase angle, which in turn is defined by the angle between the input and output polarization, so that the output polarization may be circularly and elliptical, respectively. for suitable optical transformations, this leads to a lensing effect that involves a phase difference between two distinct transformations, which can be traced back to the phase variation of a single cyclic transformation. this leads us directly to what is probably the simplest example of a pb geometric phase that can be introduced and easily controlled experimentally. 99 p. g. bhandari, ` ` structured light, '' adv. at. mol. opt. phys. * 45, * s773s797 ( 2002 ). p. bartlett, g. m. hughes, s. strumia ( aip conf. proc. 1183, new york ).
we model the internal properties of 53 lmc clusters and 10 smc clusters ( including 12 smular clusters ), and 38 galactic globular clusters ( ngc 5128 = centaurus a ), taking advantage of new surface - brightness profiles for globulars in the milky way from @xcite and some supplementary data in the literature. we combine these into a homogeneous dataset for 68 lmc, smc, and fornax clusters with homogeneous structural models to derive dynamical mass - to - light ratios for them all. we use these, along with the population - synthesis model values for each cluster, to determine the extinction @xmath0, central surface brightness ew, and globular cluster core mass, using three different models with different assumptions on the form of the stellar initial mass function. we find that the three models provide about as good fits as the untruncated power laws for the young clusters, regardless of the assumed imf. conversely, the extended power laws provide about half as many good fits for the old clusters as the power laws, and overall the extended models ( with the remaining assumption of a nearly uniform imf ) provide about 1.5 times more accurate fits to the data for each old cluster. we investigate in detail which model tends to fit the data best. we also fit the full set of cluster parameters independently, accounting for velocity dispersions and core densities ; we search for places where the data are significantly deviated from the predictions of the spherical power laws used in the modeling, and discuss the consequences for our ability to reliably estimate these parameters. for the majority of our modelled clusters, the derived cluster properties are fairly generic, showing no sign of degeneracy with age, metallicity, or other relevant properties of the clusters. some of our most specific results are : ( 1 ) for the bulk of the sample, the young massive clusters escape the half - mass limit with a velocity dispersion significantly higher than what is predicted from the power - law models ; ( 2 ) the fornx dwarf is the one cluster in which the density of stars has dropped to a fraction of the solar value ; ( 3 ) the total mass of the galaxy is distributed in a flattened, kennicutt - schmidt fashion, in excellent agreement with the prediction of a simple stellar mass - dependent scaling function for the galaxy ; and ( 4 ) the galaxy s globular disk is truncated at a radius of a few kpc, contrary to expectations.

we investigate the cme - associated solar flare event from october 1, 2011 starting at 09:18, 2011, associated with a m1.2 goes class flare. compared to existing studies, we bring new aspects into the dynamic evolution of a cme and its embedded magnetic field, by analyzing in detail the solar source region using nonlinear force - free and finite - volume helicity modeling, deriving the reconnected flux from cme associated flare ribbons and dimming areas. in a novel approach we attempt to combine results from three - dimensional reconstructions of the flare event close to the sun with _ in situ _ models for obtaining the magnetic field characteristics of the associated magnetic cloud. we compare the results derived from remote - sensing imagery and in - situ _ measurements for the two different vantage points to discuss the relationship between the parameters. we study the full disk h@xmath0 filtergrams from kanzelhhe observatory for solar and environmental research ( kso ), using full disk rotation from 0.9 to 2.2 @xmath1 m, along with the tracker of the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _ aboard the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo / hmi *??? * ), to calculate the flare reconnection flux from the core dimming regions and find that the total magnetic flux involved in the total dimming region is about 2.1 times more than the solar value. we calculate the coronal mass of the central cme, and obtain a 3d - mass estimate including the effects, showing that about 173030 % of the total cme mass, or more than 1.3 times the solar mass, could be fed into the corona by the fast outflow from the central flare - ribbon. the most important new result from this work is the indication of a rapid increase in the size of the convective core, with an increase of about 40 % in about 12 hours. this may be related to the rapid expansion and evacuation of coronal plasma, as soon as the corons get compressed and moved away from the sun due to the explosive release of magnetic energy. we use the flare time evolution and the identification of regions involved in magnetic reconnection and dissipative transport of magnetic flux, and determine that the most likely cause of the large - scale magnetic field strength in the low - corona, is the amplification of the erupting magnetic flux rope, extending from south - east to the north - west, which is reflected in
we calculated the contribution of type ia supernovae ( sni ) to the global @xmath0-ray background ( cgb ). our approach differs from that of previous works in that we use the observed star formation history of the universe to normalize the star formation rate under the assumption of an imf. we also consider the time delays between snii and sni explosions, and find that they can account for most of the observed cgb. however, the standard model does not match the observed flux of the cgb above 3 mev, which could still be an overestimate. combining data from various wavelength bands provides a simple way to constrain sni as a viable alternative to a new source population. # 1 # 2 # 3 apj. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3 nucl. phys. b ( proc. suppl.)#1#2 # 3, phys. lett. a ( # 1 ) * # 2(#3 ) # 3.. citex[#1]#2@fileswauxout tempcntb@neciteaciteforciteb:=#2citeo#1 citeotempcnta > gsave newpath 20 20 moveto 20 220 lineto 220 20 lineto closepath 2 setlinewidth gsave.4 setgray fill grestore stroke gamma - ray background cosmology.it is not yet known what the cosmic microwave background is, nor how it is formed. the most commonly used observable quantity in cosmology is the strength of the radiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ). there is no galaxy type that can fill the gap between the seyfert galaxies and the blazars. rather, the sn is believed to be the primary source of the bulk, or all, of the mev background. supernova - induced cgb can constrain the sfr(z ) at high redshift. our calculations also suggest that the delay between star formation activity and its associated sni activity must be larger by at least a factor two. these modifications are essential to obtain a cgb that agrees with all current measurements, and may still provide new constraints on sn properties.
we compare 2d axisymmetric nonrelativistic jet simulations performed with zeus-3d and with simulations performed using a relativistic godunov scheme. comparisons are made for three parameters : the mach number ( @xmath0 r/@xmath1 ), the energy flux / ram pressure of the jet, and the size of the cocoon surrounding the jet. our results are as follows. ( 1 ) the morphology of the jets and their internal structure change with lorentz factor in a similar manner for all three sets of simulations. ( 2 ) the jets with slower flow speeds are less stable than those with faster speed in the other parameter space. ( 3 ) we confirm the need for performing the stability analysis before performing the hydrodynamic computations. ( 4 ) in order to compare jets of different mach numbers and morphologies, we perform a linear stability analysis of the generated intensity plots. we show that the intensities in each set of simulations do not agree with the predictions of simple models. ( 5 ) our rescaled velocity plots show evidence for weak kinematics in the jets, which suggests that the jets are younger and less stressed than the homogeneous assumption used in these simulations. also, the simulated profiles do not match the observed helical and filamentary structures in the radio source cawthorne ii, despite the fact that our simulations have a lower mach number. ( 6 ) we discuss the implications of these results for the interpretation of observations of relativistically jets.

we present an asynchronous implementation of replica exchange molecular dynamics, where the exchange attempts are driven by external commands sent by one of the replicas. the code is based on the mpi library and does not require multi - thread capabilities. as a reference, we also implement a synchronous version. both implementations are implemented in mpi language and use the same code for communication and computation. we test our scheme on a lennard - jones liquid and compare its performance with the salsa molecular dynamics package. we find that asynchronous simulation is more efficient than the synchronous one. our implementation also has the advantage that it does not exhibit barriers, and can be easily extended to address non - nearest neighbor exchanges. molecular dynamics simulations can usually be divided into two branches : ( a ) simulation of replicas and waiting time, and ( b ) global exchange dynamics. in both cases, the data is exchanged rather than coordinates, and hence the overhead due to the exchanges is reduced, at the price of a slightly more complex analysis of the resulting trajectories. the latter is usually obtained by using an exchange stride which is as small as possible. as shown by dalcantonov et al. @xcite, for simulations with many replicas a good agreement is established between the total number of steps performed by the nodes, and the number of times the exchange is attempted. they also showed that in the case of multiple replicas the efficiency can be improved by a factor of up to 30 %. here we present an alternative scheme where only two mpi calls need to be handled. this scheme allows for a reduction in the overhead and results in a significant improvement in computational efficiency. in detail, we show by means of a simple test case ( a simulation of a bcx cluster of 4000 particles ) of the interparticle interaction interaction that the exchange acceptance of two @xmath0 replicas can be achieved with a waiting time of approximately 30 % irrespectively of the time of the last attempt. + * key words : * molecular dynamics ; replica exchange ; mpi ; asynchronous implementation ; queueing networks ; ljubljana _
we quantitatively investigate the prospects for the detection of fe group x - ray emission lines in gamma - ray burst afterglows, both with swift and with chandra and xmm, and to distinguish between the fe 6.7 and 6.4 kev lines. in particular we investigate how far the line can be detected, and when and how the line could be distinguishable, using observations of the afterglow starting promptly after the trigger and up to @xmath0 days after the prompt trigger. two simplified models for the time - dependence of the fe line rest - frame equivalent widths are considered, one with a nominal broad ` ` line width of 0.67 kev '' ( 10 % of the rest frame line energy ), and the other with a modest ` ` narrow '' ( 0.2 kev ) line width ( 5 % ) comparable to what is observed. both models have a rising and decaying index, with the peak near one day, compatible with current observations. the number of lines found depends on the assumed time scale, and on the energy of the corresponding fe k-@xmath1 line. we find that it is much easier to distinguish co or ni he - like lines from the fe6.7 kev line than it is to detections of lines with higher energies. for a burst with standard energy resolution, the apparent line width difference is about a factor of 10, much larger than previously reported. however, the difference between the redshifts of the high and low redshift lines can be as low as 0.5 - 1 s, and is probably at most of the order a few s, because of the shift in the signal - to - noise ratio of the line observations. assuming that the detector effective area differences are due to detector effective temperatures and delays to detection, and that the line detectability is affected by a number of factors including detector noise and the system integration time, the degree to which the centroid of the lines is characterized, etc., the maximum redshift to which lines of different line geometries can be differentiated is found to be somewhat larger than what is expected from the simple estimate. the implications of this in the context of grb detection are discussed.

in this paper we show a tight link between the problems ` ` division in power circuits '' and ` ` conjugacy in the baumslag - solitar group @xmath0 ''. that is, we show that the problem of division of binary integers in a power circuit is solvable in polynomial time on a strongly generic set if and only if the time complexity of the solution of the word problem of the baumgartner - nordstrm extension of the solvable hamiltonian is polynomials. we prove a general statement that every hnn extension of an hnn group with a finite tower of exponentials has a decidable word problem. this does not mean that the case equations for the hnn extensions with this tower are necessarily decidable ; indeed, we give examples where the problem is not even decidable. the complexity classes that can be considered in this paper are the following : * generically, every problem where the average case complexity is defined ( i.e., the worst case complexity does not depend on the height of the tower ) ; * usually, in addition, these problems are arithmetical problems. the input are power circuits representing integers, the output are letters, and the output is a binary representation of the integers. this means that it is possible to represent huge values of integer values by very small circuits. for this purpose we define a ` ` pairing '' pairing between random walks in the cayley graph and the dyck words. in this way, the problem becomes linear and, for large enough sequences of words, simple multiplication by powers of a single integers. * we obtain a new result that is completely in agreement with standard combinatorial group theory. in particular, if a random walk has probabilityless solutions in the subgroup of the group with the tower function, then it must have a finite time complexity. * division of power circuits : the problem has non - trivial solution. we obtain the ( non - local ) optimal solution for power circuits by considering a highly generic worst - case case and by treating the problem as a proper arithmological problem. the optimal ( so called magnus break - down ) algorithm for solving it is also obtained. our results are fully explicit and fully accessible, both with and without the use of forbidding special purpose constructions. the proof relies on information in the literature. + _ keywords : _ hnn, group theory, barcelona - group, power circuits, dehn function, word problem,
the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr ) is the most compelling example of a satellite currently being cannibalized by the milky way. there have been numerous studies reporting the discovery of stars and star clusters plausibly associated with debris from this satellite, either trailing or leading it along its orbit. in this paper we explore whether the observed tidal tails of sgr can be represented by a single - component model traveling along a single orbit in a variety of galactic potentials. we present the results of a comprehensive all - sky survey of the satellite s tidal streams using n - body simulations to explore the parameter space of potentials for sgr s orbit, allowing orbital, potential and sgr internal parameters to vary. our goal is to constrain the parameters of the galactic potential to as tightly as possible, and use these constraints to assess possible evolution of the sgr orbit. we find that a ` ` prolate '' ( @xmath0 0.75 ) spherical spherical halo is unable to reproduce the trailing drift velocity data, nor can it account for the leading portion of the velocity trend since the halo would need to be significantly prolate to explain the leading debris component. in a companion paper, we presented a model in which sgr is captured by a mass follows - light galactic potential, in which the satellite orbits are assumed to be initially prolate, and an oblate halo with a mass fraction of 0.85/0.87 gyr. here we extend our simulation efforts to include the effect of tidal forces from sgr ; we use the test - particle method of law et al. to calculate the best - fit parameters to the observed positions and velocities of the m giant stars selected from the 2mass database. for each of these potentials, we compute an orbital pole precession coefficient consistent with the leading vs trailing data using the observed orbital pole shape and path - fitting the simulation line - of - sight velocity data so that the leading + vs trailing trajectories are orthogonal to each other at the apocentric distance for each model. we conclude that no single orbit, single component model, or prolate halo can account for all the data accurately : both the leading and trailing velocity trends are better - fit by a prolate or oblate potential. our simulations indicate that sgr will evolve significantly over a hubble time in which case some evolution of its orbit over the time - period that the debris explores is incorrect. we use our results to compare our predictions to
we show that the marginal distribution, i.e., the probability distribution of the spin projections of a @xmath0-spin particle in three - dimensional space, can be calculated in terms of the state density matrix of the particle. this distribution can be used to construct a model of a topological state of a two - level atom, whose state is described by the wigner d - function. we also show that this model can describe the orientation of a spin top and the motion of its center of mass with respect to a fixed axis in space. in the case of a symmetric top, we also find that the wave function of spinor can be represented in the form of spin. m.h. anderson, j.r. ensher, and m.g. raymer, _ statistical mechanics _ ( wiley - vch, new york, 1977 ). a.a. veselago, s.v. kabakova, and g. leuchs ` ` discrete - time processes in atomic matter '', phys. rev. lett. * 92 *, 163601 ( 2001 ). j.m. ward, b.f.l. gilmo, and t. white, ` ` topological transitions and collective excitations in nuclei '', nat. phys. * 2 *, 861836 ( 2011 ). b.e. sariyanni and n.g.s. kim @xcite first discussed these phenomena in the context of quantum mechanics. they considered the equilibrium states of repulsive and attractive interactions between two particles and generalized the notion of mixed states to include the mixed states of the particles. a common knowledge, which is useful for the description of the behaviour of a many - body system, is that the mixed state is characterized by a hermitian density matrix. in particular, in the presence of a mixed state, the density matrix may be obtained through a reflection scattering process. in this case, the reflection scattering allows for the calculation of the ground - state and excited - state properties of the nuclei. however, there exist the mixed - state states that can not be captured by a reflection - scattering scheme. the corresponding quantum - mechanical quantities are, therefore, usually treated as pure states. here, we will consider the analogous situations in the light of the degeneracy between the spin and the angular momentum. we will treat the states described by mixed states as mixed states and derive the corresponding marginal distribution. for the purpose
we present a generic method that can be used to interpret uv transit light curves of unresolved or partly resolved stellar emission lines. this method is based on tracing the emitted flux from the stellar atmosphere through the upper atmosphere of the planet and the interstellar medium to the observing instrument at earth. we have demonstrated this method in practice by applying it to the existing uv transiting planet radial velocity measurements in the h ly@xmath0 and o i triplet lines ( bj10 ) in the fuv. we find that the observed upper boundary characteristics of the thermosphere are consistent with models that assume that there are no extra enas or hydrogen atoms accelerated by radiation pressure outside the roche lobe. based on this model, we obtain a full - width oxygen ( o i ) transit depth of 4.3 @xmath10 1 % for hd209458b. the o i transit depth is sensitive to interstellar absorption and is consistent with the full width of the emission line that is visible in the uv. in addition, we show that the temperature and o / h ratio derived from the model are in agreement with the observed values. the proximity of the upper boundary and the observed o i absorption line indicate that interstellar oxygen is in the dissociation state and that the abundance is approximately 1/6 solar. an even better match with the data is obtained if the lower boundary of the model is located above the ionized neutral atom dissociation front. an extended, but still uncomfortably high temperature regime is required to obtain a consistent fit to the transit depth measurements. with the exception of the discrepancy between bj08 and bj87.6 % and anisj08.1 %, which is attributed to differences in the treatment of the different spectral regions in the two objects. we demonstrate that the discrepancy is caused by the difference in the modeling of the response function of the stis g140 m grating. we also discuss the reasons for the disagreement. we argue that the disagreement is a result of the large o i escape flux and the assumption that superolar oxygen abundance is assumed in the models.
we have used the submillimetre camera ( scuba ) on the subaru telescope to survey an area of @xmath0, detecting 19 sources down to a 3@xmath1 sensitivity limit of between 3 and 4 mjy at 850@xday m. of these, 16 sources are detected at radio wavelengths, and of the remaining 5 the radio / submillmetre flux ratios and radio sizes suggest that the dust in these galaxies is being heated by young stars rather than agn. if one assumes a dust temperature typical of a low - redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ), one obtains a bolometric luminosity an order - of - magnitude lower than that of arp 220. the median redshift of the scuba sources is 0.22. the luminosity ratio obtained from the radio observations is consistent with that determined in other surveys, although there is evidence that the ulirgs are more luminous at a low redshift than the average scuba galaxy by a factor of 2 or more. in the image that shows the best view of the galaxy population, which shows a cluster of stars aligned with iso 0, we find a redshift distribution consistent with the galaxy forming at a high redshift and an average dust emissivity index of two. by coadding over the image it becomes possible to determine the average dust temperature in the population as a whole, although the uncertainty is large and the dust emission shifts from the centres of the galaxies to the regions of the brightest star - forming regions. this suggests that the extinction of the proto - spheroid population is not due to dust, but that the main heating source of the dust must be young stars. we have also used the radio data to estimate the average cosmic density of dust across the survey area. we find that the average fraction of dust contained in dust is the same across all surveys, independent of redshift. this implies that the cosmic history of the universe was a ` dark age'in which 90 % of the light is absorbed by dust, a similar result to studies of the canada - france redshift survey fields.
we present a sample of 2357 x - ray point sources detected in 590 ks _ chandra _ observations of the 17 by 17 field around, including 201 sources at the galactic center and 18 at or near the galactic plane. this is the largest number of sources ever detected in a single field at @xmath0 erg s@xmath1. the surface density of sources is more than three times higher than has been detected at any other location in the galaxy so far. we find that the fraction of sources with 2.0 kev or more luminosity increases from 8 % at the outer galactic plane to 40 % within the innermost 300 pc. we confirm that the 2.08 kev luminosity function is a nearly power - law with an index of 0.44 and with a photon flux distribution that is peaked at 0.52.0 euv at 20 % confidence. this indicates that the emission from galactic center sources is comprised of a mixture of stellar sources and of diffuse interstellar plasma heated by supernovae and galactic collisions. about 40 % of the sources have a radial distribution of foreground sources consistent with a ks - test, which suggests that the foregrounds are accreting from low - mass companions with low luminosities. the density of background sources is nearly always lower than that inferred from the spectra, implying that the bulk of the flux originates in the galactic disk and bulge, and that it is contaminated by other sources. we cross - correlate the observed flux distribution with that of the foreground sources, and find that 148 of the 2357 sources have optical counterparts, on order of 200 of which could be spurious. we estimate that the total integrated luminosity of the catalog sources is about $1.6 times lower than expected from its integrated brightness at 2 kev. the discrepancy is likely due to differences in the measurement technique used to distinguish foreground and background sources, since the optical matches are typically 50 % or better smaller in the center, while the ratio is 300:1 or more in the bulge. we discuss several examples of sources in the field that could be candidates for spectral energy distribution studies, such as cataclysmic variables, young stellar objects, and faint neutron stars.
we show that knotted and linked disclination surfaces in liquid crystals can be produced by the chirality and orientation imposed by the cell boundaries. this is supported by the complete topological classification of surfaces in two dimensions, which states that any compact surface can be classified up to homeomorphism by its genus, orientability and number of boundary components. the classification theorem naturally separates into four classes of surfaces ; orientable or non - orientable and closed or with boundary. closed, orientable surfaces are known to induce defects corresponding to the element of a surface, where the genus is the same as the euler characteristic. a surface with boundary can act as a disclination loop and so contains an even or odd number of disclinations. disclinations that close up into loops fall into four distinct homotopy classes. in cholesterics the knots are metastable, otherwise the system tries to expel the reverse twist by forming an unstable knot. these knots have the same topological properties as the recently discovered ` toron'textures. we discuss how the knotted field configurations can be thought of as the result of expanding the central part of a toron locally into two twisted defects, that then rotate to form knots. the knot genus can be determined by the texture around the knot ; we can use the texture to compute the knot invariant, a classical knot - invariant. the pt construction involves drawing the surfaces on which the director field is perpendicular to a given direction, yielding precisely constructed knots and links. * keywords * : chiral nematics, surfaces, disclination lines, toron, genus, knot complexity.

we study the dark matter distribution around a supermassive non - rotating black hole by solving euler s equations on a flat, but non - flat background space - time, which is within our domain. we adopt a late - time solution for the fluid that is a relativistic collisional ideal gas with constant accretion rate and density profile. the fluid is assumed to start with a set of initial conditions that are similar to those given by the navarro frenk white and moore models, where the density profile is characterized by an initial rest mass density and an adiabatic index @xmath0. after obtaining the late time solutions, we solve the euler equations for a large number of different values of the initial conditions by fixing the background curvature and radius of the black hole. the main results of this study are the following : ( i ) our solutions agree with the result obtained by michel [ _ et al. _, astrophys. j. * 209 *, l57 ( 2000 ) ] as a result of the pressure variation of the ideal gas equation of state with constant density ; ( ii ) they reproduce the exact solutions obtained by the same authors for the case of a collisionless gas ; and ( iii ) they are consistent with the standard approach of supermassive black hole growth and accretion based on the seminal accretion models. nevertheless, due to the presence of a black hole, our solutions can not go beyond the approximations that have been used in the literature for the pressureless case, which suggests that the actual dark matter density profiles are flatter than those derived from thecdm standard approach. in particular, we find that there are only a single fit of the density profiles that can describe the behavior of the fluid at the kpc scale for all the cases of non - zero pressure. using this result as an example we propose a possible solution to the galactic cusp - core problem and the corresponding gravitational collapse, in which a collisionally excited dark matter halo is located at the center of a galaxy and accreted in the opposite direction from the central black hole ; ( iv ) our result can be used as a tool to put constraints on the properties of dark matter at very small scales, for instance, the innermost regions of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. -.6 in [ firstpage ] dark matter cosmology : theory galaxies : halos galaxies : kinematics and dynamics galaxies : structure.
this paper reports on the detection of transient periodic or quasi - periodic fluctuations in closed and open magnetic structures of the quiet solar corona. the fluctuations have been mapped with the wavelet transform technique in a systematic manner, which represents a powerful tool to investigate the fine spatial pattern and temporal variability of fluctuating coronal features. the technique has been applied to derive the temporal evolution of white - light images of the outer corona from 1.4 to @xmath0 for the first time. the analysis shows that the total brightness variability in the corona is non - stationary in nature, characterized by a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. however, throughout the observational time interval of 9 days the fluctuations are not uniformly distributed but appear as embedded in fluctuating magnetic structures, such as ar - systems and ray - like features in the equatorial streamer. these results are consistent with the presence of a complex interplay of stochastic and concomitant motions of the coronal plasma. furthermore, the temporal scales of the detected fluctuations are significantly larger than those of the slow magneto - acoustic waves, implying that these waves are trapped in the closed closed structures, and that they can only be excited by external perturbations. the work presented here adds weight to the hypothesis that the steady state coronal magnetic field, driven by coronal inhomogeneities, plays an important role in the evolution and spatial distribution of the plasma fluctuations. it is shown that the slow mhd waves are a promising candidates for the origin of the observed variability, since the variability can be ascribed to a pressure disturbance localized near one of the footpoints along the arch and reflected at the opposite footpoint, thus generating a standing wave ( a compression back and forth along the magnetic flux tube ). the paper refers to the possibility that the standing waves are the result of the passage of coronal plumes across the instantaneous fundamental velocity ( fov ), provided the same process is acting at the base of both kinds of structures.
we present the first relativistic quantum - defect detection of rydberg atoms in the radio frequency spectrum. the measurements are made using a sample of ultracold @xmath0cs atoms in a far - off resonant optical dipole trap with a precisely measured frequency - doubling unit ( fs725 ) laser. the lowest ionization energy of the system is determined to lie in the range 110.000(1 ) mhz. we observe transitions to the lower hyperfine components of the 6s@xmath1cs ground state of chiral bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) and to the @xcite-@xcite and hg - hg transitions. the character of the former transition is investigated by measuring the frequency - tunability of the laser, while the latter transition is studied by using radio - frequency ( rf ) measurements. from the measured frequencies we obtain an accurate estimate of the mode number of the beating comb tooth. ultrahigh - precision chemical quantum information is now available for quantum systems with few - body and many - body interactions. this has allowed experimentalists to study, for the first time, the interplay between quantum entanglement, quantum coherence, and chemical interactions over a wide range of length scales. one of the most promising prospects for quantum information processing is to realize quantum computers that allow their users to dynamically control their quantum states. recently, several realizations of quantum computers have been proposed. however, their realization is hampered by significant computational costs and the requirement of reliable quantum gates. an alternate approach to quantum computing has been to use ultrafast atoms as quantum memories. this approach, which is advantageous for quantum computing, requires a physical system that is very well isolated from the environment and is therefore quite sensitive to small - scale details of the quantum mechanical interactions between the atoms. an example of such a system is the quantum memory device ( qvd ), a memory device that allows its owner to update his or her computer data repeatedly, even while the device is away from the system ( e.g., driving a web page ). another approach is to use quantum - error correcting codes to update their quantum information, allowing the user to ` relocalize'their stored data whenever needed. in this paper, we report on a measurement of the frequency tunable light for excitation into rydderberg states at 319 nm. we use a technique that allows us to measure the doppler widths of individual hyperfine transitions to a precisely determined lower ionization
we review observational properties and chemical abundances of dwarf galaxies as a function of distance. the emphasis is on star - forming dwarf irregulars and how they are classified in the local universe. we first discuss the basic properties of these objects, paying special attention to the metallicity problem, and the connection between star formation and chemical enrichment. we then focus on dwarf galaxies with hii regions and present the results of integrated spectroscopy for six of these in the virgo cluster, as well as a review of the star formation history of local group dis. finally we discuss the chemical abundance of dis at large redshift and its implications for galaxy formation. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 = cmr5 = cmbx5 # 1 metal - poor galaxies and their cosmological implications. + _ the encyclopedic analysis group, nasa / esa hubble space telescope _ + _ space telescope science institute, university of tokyo, 5 - 1 - 5 kashiwanoha, kashiwa, chiba 277 - 8582 _ element abundances and dynamics in dwarf galaxies are a subject of current interest. since most of the element production in the universe occurs in dwarfs and giant ellipticals, it is natural to ask what conditions are required to have such low abundances. one explanation could be that dwarfs evolve more slowly than giant stars, owing to their smaller mass densities, and that as a result dwarfs have more gas - rich than giants. another possibility is that evolution occurs via different channels, such as agn, supernovae or stellar winds. in this case, galaxies need to have both a large amount of gas and massive stellar populations, which can not be achieved through only one channel. since many dwarf galaxies can be regarded as ` ` starburst galaxies '', understanding the conditions for their formation is an important step. it is well known that massive starbursts leave behind behind blue stars, the traces of which are currently being observed in the ultraviolet. also known is the after - mass analysis of planetary nebulae ( pne ), that trace the ism abundance 0.1 to several gyr ago, depending on the mass of the progenitor. the results are compatible with previous chemical evolutionary models, but the uncertainty in the oxygen abundance derived from pne is likely to be larger than the @xmath0 dex estimated for the solar neighbourhood. we conclude with a discussion of the implications of
we present an overview of science results obtained with the _ all - sky monitoring experiment _ ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) during its first nine years of continuous operation. the _ batse _ eot " observations were obtained in sixteen energy bands between 20 kev and 1 mev, and were used to localize the gamma - ray flux from low - energy sources using the earth occultation technique ( eot ). several new objects were discovered in this time window, and numerous transient and periodic sources were detected. here we present a compilation of batse eot observations that can be used as the basis for more detailed studies of individual sources, for which it is important to have a knowledge of the long - lived emission in the batse energy range. the combination of the geometrical constraints of occultation, combined with a sky - dependent systematic error modeling, allowed us to accurately determine source fluxes for a total of 179 sources. we compare the sensitivity of the observations with those of the _ energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope _ ( of_w ), the heao 1 survey, and the recent catalog of hard x - rays from the galex ( gao 1 a-4 ). although the eot fluxes are sensitive to a few percent of the crab source flux, we find that the dipole fluxes of many of the detected sources are well below the sensitivity limit of _ of _ the _ w _, and some of the remaining sources are probably fainter than the flux measurement limit ( @xmath06.5 - 25 times lower, for sources with densities in the mcrab energy range ). we use the 2-dimensional earth - occurence light curves to place constraints on the flux levels of the sources that were measured, and to compare them with the fluxes measured with _ wfpc2_. in addition to a general discussion of the scientific applications of the catalog, we make a brief reference to objects that have been missed in prior publications, such as the supernova remnants, active galaxies, globular clusters, and quasars. future work will be presented for these objects.
we study the clustering of faint high - redshift galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ), using photometric redshift techniques applied to a sample of @xmath0 galaxies, some of which have been already confirmed spectroscopically by steidel et al. ( 1996a and 1996b ) and lw97. the 2-d redshift distribution of these faint galaxies is studied in terms of their clustering versus spectrophotometric properties. the main aim is to estimate their mean clustering properties as a function of the redshift. the accuracy of the results is investigated with simulations, using a semi - analytic model for galaxy formation by bruzual & charlot ( 1997 ), with 5 different synthetic star formation rates and 3 different dominant galaxy formation scenarios. we analyze the reliability of the model in different redshift intervals ( 0.1, 2.5, 3.5 and 4 ), and use it to compare the results with the currently available spectroscopic data on the star formation rate density and the correlation length. the simulations allow us to describe in detail the bias associated with the model and the effects of reddening and metallicity on the results, and to address the question of the role of these galaxies as the progenitors of the nowadays clusters or groups of galaxies. a specific set of hierarchical galaxy formation models is used to compute the hierarchical correlation length and to investigate its dependence on the parameters used to define the sample selection, such as the type, the age, the stellar population and the reddening. the hierarchical bias can be checked against the recent results for the z=2 galaxy cl0939 + 47. the similarity of the present results on the basis of simulations and observations supports the view that galaxies at high redshift trace the recent strong clustering in the hdf, where a significant fraction, up to 50 %, of the sample are found to be clustered. the use of the hierarchical model reveals an important difference between low - z and high - z galaxies, where most of the galaxies show signs of clustering at z@xmath1=2.0, an observationally significant effect that can only be partially explained by the photometric errors. moreover, this new evidence for hierarchical clustering allows us to make a more accurate estimate of the mean structure seen in the data up to z=0.2. the structure detected in the present data can be identified as a two - component structure, consisting of two peaks, located at redshifts 0.5
the effects of nonlinearities on the amplitude of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy produced by great attractor - like ( gal ) structures evolving in open universes are analyzed. the calculations are based on the tolman - bondi solution of the einstein equations. this exact solution has been used in order to model the evolution of gal structures without the use of any gauge or approximating conditions. in this paper, it is proved that, in the case @xmath0, the initial peculiar velocity corresponding to the above density profile has an unexpected angular scale of a few degrees. this large angular scale is greater than the angular scale subtended by the gal itself. in such a case, the region affected by a significant gravitational potential is larger than that having a relevant density contrast. at the present time, however, our compensation distance for the asymmetry introduced by the spatial symmetry is still smaller than the square root of the distance from the symmetry center. thus, the effects of the deformation with respect to spherical symmetry of the gal structure do not become important. as a consequence, the amplitudes of the described cmb anisotropies are limited by the background fluctuations of the gravitational potential.

we study six dimensional phase - space density estimators based on the delaunay tessellation ( dtfe ) method and on the hierarchical decomposition of phase space using the hypercubical cell smoothing proposed by ascasibar & binney ( 2004 ). the big advantage of this method is that it is parameter free, fully adaptive while each particle has a natural neighbourhood. in practice, however, it requires the proper set up of a metric in six - dimensional space ( velocity / position scaling ). to achieve a level of detail comparable to what is usually obtained in position space, one needs a simulation with an extremely large number of particles. for this purpose, we present two methods which differ from each other in the way local interpolation is performed. the first method involves matching the positions and velocities of particles in position and in velocity subspace and finding the scaling factor between the positions of the peak of the two distributions match each other. it can be optimised locally through the definition of a shannon entropy criterion and thus requires an extra global metric. the second method involves measurement of the distance distribution function in real space and, in the case of enbid, tries to make it locally isotropic. this local scaling factor is implemented by construction in fiestas and enbid methods with adaptive metric and without it. in all these methods, a global scaling is required to fix the position / velocity scaling. we test the various implementations by applying these methods to three halo models : ( a ) the @xmath0-body simulation, ( b ) the binary tree method with anisotropic smoothing ( asph ) and ( c ) the standard smoothing with local adaptive metric in the enbid package. we show that the asph method provides the best results, especially when dealing with subhaloes. we also test an improved version of the sph method ( without adaptive metric ). we find that the best - fit parameters are the position - velocity scaling factor and the global scaling factor. when all the parameters of the method are fixed in the same way, asph methods always give better results. _ keywords _ : dark matter halo, 6d analysis, six - dimensionality, proxy, super - resolution.
the iue visual and uv energy distribution ( sed ) of a sample of chemically peculiar chemically peculiar stars for which accurate stellar photometry is available for the first time is determined. the purpose of the present paper is to determine effective temperatures, @xmath0, effective stellar parameters and angular diameters, i.e., to dereddish the observed sed, so that it can be used to improve existing calibrations of color indices. sequences of iue spectra are used to convert the observed energy fluxes into absolute fluxes, convert them into effective temperatures and compare them with model atmospheres. for a main sequence star hd 171782, whose sed is known from uv and visual scans, we calculate the temperature of the stellar surface using a model atmosphere consisting of a self consistent metal - enhanced atmosphere with a simple metal distribution and a simple chemical composition correction. for other stars with known effective temperature, we use a more complex chemical composition and additional scans corrected for interstellar absorption. to avoid problems with the photometry, old and new calibrations are included in the analysis. as a first step toward the conclusions presented here, we first calculate the fluxes at the wavelengths for which model values are listed in the literature for the stars in our sample. these fluxes are converted into absolute units using vega. for most stars the resulting effective temperatures agree well with the corresponding photometric corrections given by kurucz et al. ( 1999 ), except for the uv flux, which turned out to be very sensitive to the chemical composition. in particular, they were found to give the coolest and hottest temperatures, in the most metal deficient star in our analysis. subsequently we determined the angular diameter of the stars from the ratio of the observed to ( stellar ) surface monochromatic flux in the ( visual ) wavelength range 3000 - 5500. the results are presented in section 3. to clarify the method of including a star into our analysis and to include it in the final analysis, we folded the iue archive with 5225 objects for which necessary observations exist for a broad range of temperatures, gravities and different metal abundances ( scaled solar abundances ). several of them are of magnetic cp type.
we propose a new family of self - repairing codes ( src ) for networked storage systems which are tailored to fit well typical storage environments. we describe how src codes can amortize the repair of individual blocks to reconstruct the whole object using only a few additional encoded blocks, while allowing parallel and independent replenishment of lost redundancy. unlike traditional erasure codes, srcs allow multiple and independent repairs to occur in parallel, without the need to communicate with at least @xmath0 other nodes to reconstruct any missing fragment. thus, while the volume of data - transfer for maintenance is lowered, rgcs are expected to have higher protocol overheads, implementation and complexity for a broad range of practical system parameters. we first consider the design of a particular class of codes, and show that the construction of homomorphic codes is possible thanks to the flexibility offered by srcs. we then present a novel and simple method for deterministically solving the aforementioned problem via a network message board ( mds ) based implementation, which allows one to specify as input any suitable network domain ( for instance, encoding, decoding, etc. ) rather than using polynomial evaluation. as we discuss in detail, different regions of the mds domain can be equally well suited to implement the proposed codes, including ( i ) dynamic coding based on random linear network coding, ( ii ) low maintenance costs, which can be optimized for specific systems, and ( iii ) algorithms that allow for independent and urgent repairs when needed for specific scenarios. we conclude by demonstrating that srcs amortizes the repair cost per block for a wide range of system parameters, while maintaining the quality, for both idealized and realistic configurations. we thus demonstrate how the src family of codes can be used to significantly reduce the cost of maintaining network storage systems. we plan on continuing to develop the proposed scheme in order to do so for a larger number of systems. to accomplish this, we currently need to scale the size of the srcs library to accommodate the growing number of lost fragments and increase the number of nodes. we therefore need to develop methods that are both flexible and fast, while still maintaining redundancy at a moderate level of redundancy replenishment, as well as sufficiently fast replacements for lost fragments to mitigate further faults in the system. in this paper we pursue these goals through both algorithmic and computational research, while taking into account the most recent research in distributed storage systems ( i.e. with a fixed number of processors per system element ). we believe that the ongoing research in this area will
the kloe collaboration has analyzed a sample of 17 pb@xmath0ne, corresponding to about 50 millions of @xmath1 decays, from the data sample collected by the kloe detector at the frascati boson factory. decays of five prompt photons are selected. a constrained fit allowing for the kinematic closure of the events is applied, in order to suppress the background photons. the expected number of expected events is about 50 million. the decays br(23 ), br(24 ) and br(25 ) are well described by the standard qcd sum - rules. the branching ratios br(s / b ), which determines the s / b of the decay, do not differ significantly from the results obtained by the vepp-2 m and kloe detectors in the year 2000. some preliminary results are also reported for the related background channels. the ratio of the two isochrones is in agreement with the pdg value ( i.e. with the values quoted by the collaboration at the beginning of the decade, when the first results were obtained ), while the discrepancy between the measured values and the quark mass derived from the recent measurements by the two experiments is still under study. + pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm plus 1pt minus 1pt # 1 # 1 ( # 1,#2,#3)*#1 *, # 2 ( # 3,#4)#1#2#3j. high energy physics institute for nuclear research * # 1 * ( # 2 ) # 3rd november 2000 * search for lowest lying scalar mesons with masses below 1 gev * * k Chloe collaboration * + _ ( submitted to eur. phys. j. c. ) _ + _ f.d. weinberg institut fr theoretische physik, universitt wrzburg, campus hubland nord, emil - fischer - str. 31, d-9707400 wrz, germany _ cavendish hep - ph/99 - 009 + * mon. notkestrasse 85, switzerland _ + * r. arcidiacono, g. bocquet, n. cabibbo, a. ceccucci, d. cundy, v. falaleev, p. faulandini, m. fidecaro, l. gatignon, h. k
we investigate free circular analysis and free matrix polynomials from the perspective of the emerging areas of free convexity and free analysis. in particular interest is the classification of free spectrahedra, of which the eigenvalue classes of the effros - winkler theorem form an effective hahn - banach separation. we obtain several new results characterizing circular free spectral combinations, including a sharpening of the well - known ball - marx - vinnikov theorem characterizing free circular matrix convex sets. we also present a self - contained proof of the latter. as a corollary we obtain a new result characterizing the uniform matrix idiom for free circular domains. this article is dedicated to george sperling whose curious, incisive mind rarely fails to produce the unexpected creative idea. george and i have been colleagues for the longest time in both of our careers. the benefit has been mine. learning to see.
a _ loophole free _ experiment is discussed which does not rely on post selection and requires detection efficiency of at least 67 % @xmath0. we present a feasible method of obtaining the proper probabilities, i.e., ratios of detected events to the number of emitted systems, of a bell experiment which requires only 67 % detection efficiency. the experiment is proposed to take advantage of the recent improvements in detection technology and intricate elaborations of the experimental details. details are worked out and conclusions are drawn for a two photon polarization coincidence experiment at an asymmetric nonminimal superposition of two nonlinear crystals. 99 e. j. post, a. santos, and j. b. bell, ` ` ` no enhancement assumption is a crucial ingredient for bell tests '', phys. rev. lett. * 90 *, 094005 ( 1998 ). e. g., einstein, podolsky, and rosen. _ _ i would like to thank my advisor, j. a. smolyaninov, for all his support, encouragement, and guidance throughout the last years. i thank maike meyer, ramin naimi, rahul basu, m. talati, and s. zhang for all help and support, faculdade de la recherche scientifique, politecnico di frascati, p.le aldo moro 1, i-40126 milano, italy + e - mail : r.m.komorowski@polito.it _ _ 0.5 cm _ it is very tragic that after thirty years of hard work there is still no conclusive evidence for a loophole free experiment to be performed loophole free. let us remind the history of the problem and remind us of the first proposals to banishing low detection free experiments from the literature which claimed to be loophole free " and claiming to be first violation of einstein s inequality ", e.g., torgerson, branning, monken, and mandel. unfortunately all such experiments carried out so far have in fact been carried out with high detection efficiency and high visibility which in turn implies that one can not expect anything else to change except that some _ post selection _ is needed. it is shown in this paper that a recent _ preselection _ method for preparing non maximally entangled photon pairs in a nonlinear crystal is particularly attractive in that it employs the solid angles of the detector solid angles together with the use of a down
we present the results of the ` k - means ` classification of _ hinode _ spectropolarimeter sot / sp stokes @xmath0 profiles of upflow regions between 15 nm and 30 nm from the disk center. our classification procedure allows us to identify a fairly broad class of strongly asymmetric profiles that emerge in the quiet sun. most of these profiles are classified as being antisymmetric, blue - lobe - like, asymmetric, or complex. in about half of these cases the shape of the profile can be identified as a single - lobe or red - lobe only. in addition, in some cases the profiles can be grouped into six families that emerge from the decomposition of the data into angular resolution and thickness. these six families can be used to investigate the complexity of the shapes of the profiles observed in a small portion of quiet photosphere at radii less than a few arcsec. in most cases these shapes can be described by either a temperature inversion or a micro - loop model, but the results can also be shown to be consistent with the inversion codes used, namely, the misma model and the circular - polarization profiles obtained by e.g., muram snapshots. the lack of symmetric profiles observed can be explained in terms of the incorrect temperature stratification of the solar photosphere. from our classification results we found that strong asymmetries not only emerge in general, but also in some classes of polarized profiles, which indicate that the amplification of the stokes signal due to discontinuities along the los is significant. this amplification makes it possible to use more general shape typologies to analyze the polarized profiles observed, for example, by searching for the edges of the polarization profiles. this kind of classification is potentially useful for the interpretation of other types of inversion measurements performed by the solar community.

we studied the kinematics and stellar populations of the boxy or peanut - shaped bulges of a sample of five edge - on disc galaxies. kinematic rotation is not a ubiquitous feature in boxy bulges, but it is present in roughly half of the sample. we observed the lick indices in our sample and used the line strengths to estimate luminosity - weighted star formation rates ( ssp - ews ) and ages. in one of the galaxies, ngc 3390, we found evidence for a bar, which is seen at an angle to the galactic plane ( @xmath0 ). we speculated that this bar is the result of secularly rearranged disc material. we conclude that the bar is not critical to the dynamical evolution of the bulge, but that it might be a remnant of a previous merger. ngc 1381, on the other hand, is composed of a bulge that is resolved into a highly non - axisymmetric structure ( fig. [ ] ), and a disc that is kinematically and photometrically similar to that of classical bulges and elliptical galaxies. we detected two behaviours consistent with the former being a pure disc and the latter anti - correlating with the latter : positive and negative metallicity gradients, respectively. this behaviour is consistent with a simple disc model, and therefore supports the bar buckling scenario, in which the inner disc is constituted of material formed on short timescales and then rapidly buckled to the disk. we inferred that the two galaxies must have experienced at least two merging events in their past. had these occurred at roughly the same time, the implied merger rates would have been much higher. the other two galaxies probed by our survey do not show any sign of bar - buckling, and we speculate that they are not high - mass systems, but are comprised of a mixture of old disc and bulge stars that formed very rapidly.

we have studied the kinematics and spatial distribution of early and late type galaxies in a subset of the rich abell clusters observed in the eso nearby abell cluster survey ( enacs ). the galaxies were classified into three classes ( e, s0 and s+i ) on the basis of their spectrum, which was estimated from a principal component analysis ( pca ), combined with an artificial neural network ( ann ), to try and classify the galaxies in the enacs spectra. the pca is an important first step in the classification process, as it compresses essentially all significant information of a spectrum into a limited number of principal components ( pcs ). after the morphological type is determined from the pcs, an ann is trained to attempt to classify the galaxy spectrum based on those components, with a set of 150 galaxies for which the morphology is known from imaging. the success rate in classifying the galaxies is measured and the percentage of galaxies classified separately according to their morphological types is discussed separately. for the e and s0 galaxies, the classification success rate is @xmath0, while for the galaxies with emission lines it is close to 100 %. when the elg spectrum is considered a priori known, the ratio of the successful classification rate to the reduced probabilities of each individual galaxy is larger than 100 %, suggesting that the chance of a spectral misclassification of an e / s0 galaxy is small compared to that of a late type galaxy. the data are consistent with a picture in which the early type galaxies are spirals which, on traversing the dense cluster cores, are on radial orbits, while the non elg are a more advanced product of encounters in the central cluster region. the agn are a special class. the results of the ann analysis are in good agreement with the result of a pca analysis, except for the emission lines, which can be explained in the context of ramrez & de souza ( 1997 ). that conclusion is based on an analysis of the projected distribution of the line - emitting galaxies, in particular the lack of emission lines in the main concentration of the coma cluster. the origin of the difference in the line of sight velocity dispersion of the emission line galaxies, which is inversely proportional to the average velocity of the cluster, is investigated.

we discuss the implications of a mirror baryonic dark matter scenario for the structure formation process. the basic idea is to have a hidden mirror ( m ) sector of the universe in which both the ordinary sector and the matter component have the same microphysics as the ordinary one, but with smaller temperature, @xmath0, and with the same cosmological parameters, leading to somewhat different particle physics in the mirror sector. we studied the effects of such a mirror sector on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) radiation and structure, of the parallel mirror world. we obtained many different mirror models for a flat mirror universe with adiabatic scalar density perturbations, changing one parameter each. in addition, we computed the cmb and lss power spectra for a large range of parameters, and compared their consistence with the current data. we found a great influence of the mirror dark matter on the mirror parameters, specially for the so - called standard model ( cdm ), and a non - linear dependence on the baryon density. we extended the lss spectra to smaller scales and higher mirror temperatures, showing that for a mbdm scenario the mirror effects are stronger than for a cdm case. this allows us to obtain a new limit for the mirror parameter space, comparing with the one obtained from the observation of the cold dark matter model ( mstm ). we show that, for _ all _ values of mirror parameters used in the standard cdm, where the ordinary and mirror sectors are identical, mstms are equivalent to the cdm at high ( low ) temperature, but different at low ( high ( high ) temperature. this means that the bbn constraints can be taken into account, giving us an important insight into the mirror structure formation scenario. furthermore, we showed that the shape and the locations of the peaks and oscillations of photon and matter power spectrum are different for different mirror scenarios changing only one of the parameters. this is compatible with observations. mirrors, dark matter, lss, cosmology
we investigate the effect of local fluctuations in the indium concentration on carrier localization in ingan quantum wells grown in a single temperature using atom probe tomography. we calculate the ground state probability density of an electron ( red ) and hole ( green ) and find that the holes are strongly localised in the range of indium concentrations used to characterise the ingan within the well. the electron and hole wave functions are calculated using solution of the effective mass schrdinger equation, @xmath0, and the corresponding electrostatic potential. considering only the polar region of the well, with one mono - layer thick disk - shaped wafer, we find the full potential energy landscape of carriers to be consistent with single zone microstructures. calculations of the strain energies and wave functions show that indium atoms in the c - plane of the qw are clearly localised on a length scale of just a few nanometers, whereas monolayer wwfs cause an increase in localization length of up to 35 nm for the 5 % indium sample. when these localised carriers are subject to well width fluctuations, they cause a change in potential energy which we quantify by calculating the localization energy of the carriers. finally, by comparing our results with the localization lengths of graham el and jacob el., we show that the inclusion of wwf islands has a negligible effect on the carrier localization. the complete characterization of a material property ( e.g. carrier localization ) is essential to the development of a device measuring the material properties. there has been much recent progress in understanding the effects of nanometer - scale fluctuations on the structural properties of quantum wells ( qws ) @xcite. small changes in the properties of these systems have been observed, such as the in@xmath1 in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and atom force spectroscopy ( tem ). these studies have shown that, at low temperatures, ingan qws can be mechanically supported by various types of measurements, including frequency, strain, electric field, and piezoelectric field. semiconductor quantum wells have been identified as a promising material for the observation of nanoscale fluctuations in which broad band excitations are excited, leading to a realisation of a new class of materials where quantum fluctuations are balanced by local excitations. the goal of the current work is to develop a model for qws that can be used to measure and compare quantum properties with these experiments. at the present stage, there is no clear evidence of carrier

we investigate analytically the effects of an additive gaussian white noise on a special bistable system that displays birhythmicity coexisting attractors that are characterized by different frequencies. the model is a self - sustained _ van der pol _ oscillator with a nonlinear dissipation of higher polynomial order described by the equation ( overdots as usual stand for the derivative with respect to time ) @xmath0 this model was proposed by kaiser _ et al. _ to model enzymatic substrate reaction with ferroelectric behavior in biological systems. from the standpoint of nonlinear dynamics, it represents a model which exhibits an extremely rich bifurcation behavior. we derive an effective _ fokker - planck _ equation for the birhythmic system and verify, with numerical simulations, that the effective temperature is capable to cause a crossover between the residence times only in a very narrow region of the phase space, inasmuch as the noise causes a contraction of the region of existence of birh rhythmicity. the pseudopotential barrier numerically derived by the approximation is therefore, in the phase - amplitude approximation, an effective potential for the amplitude variables. we confirm several features of the pseudo - potential, for instance that the potential barriers are proportional to the nonlinear parameter and that the spectrum of the possible solution of the stochastic second order differential equation is broad. * the results of this investigation are subject to the fluctuation instability referred to as the _ einstein crisis_. * in general, for the kind of system under consideration, the variance of the deterministic attractors ( _ i.e. _ the coexistence between two stable regimes of limit cycle oscillations ) is larger than the noise intensity. for a linear system this leads to the phenomenon of diffusion, while the coupling of noise to nonlinear deterministic equations can lead to non - trivial effects. *
the star @xmath0 boo is a unique object in the sense that it hosts, in addition to having a giant planet, a planet. the planet is known to undergo polarity reversals in its magnetic field, which are stable over several solar cycles. the nature of this polarity reversal is an open question, but its duration and the precise timing of the reversal is a key to understanding the effect it has on the planetary system. here, we study the influence of the geometry of the coronal magnetic field on the stellar wind properties in a 3-dimensional mhd numerical model that includes the effects of gravity, the rotation of the stellar winds, the planetary orbital motion, and the planet s own magnetic field. we present the results of our stellar wind modelling and analysis, and we evaluate the radio emission produced by the host star at each observed epoch of the solar cycle. the radio flux is found to be constant to within a factor of two and that it has not been detected from any planet detected to date.

many neutrino detectors rely on micro - channel plate photomultipliers for time and space resolution, while relying on the use of narrowband photodetectors to obtain higher signal - to - noise ratio and better image quality. however, the spatial resolution of these detectors is limited by the size of the cathodal elements. to overcome this limitation, we have built an optical time projection chamber ( otpc ) consisting of a 40 kg deionized water cherenkov detector based on a combination of a planar mach - zehnder electro - optic plate ( pmt ) and optical mirrors. this detector relies on low - power, low - cost ( 10.5 w / hz ), practical monolithically integrated circuits for waveform - sampling, and has a measured angular resolution of 4 cm in 10 s of picoseconds. event tracking with a continuous variable resolution ( lappd ) has become a serious challenge in recent years. due to the need for high - resolution optical detectors, the development of efficient and cost - effective hardware for these systems has led to a significant acquisition of electronic components for readout of the waveforms onto a digital signal processor. although waveform sampling is now feasible using digital signal processors, the cost of these systems is still prohibitive. it is a challenge to time - exactly as well as to space - resolution as large as 100 km s. in this paper we describe the design, construction, and performance of an otpc detector, measuring temporal and positional information from 1-cm - deep water samples viewed by a 5 cm - deep pmt. the prototype, which we describe below, shows that the otpc can resolve charged particle tracks with resolutions of 40 cm and can measure positions of individual photons with a time resolution of 8 s. results are shown in figure [ fig : otpc ]. the results are compared with previously reported otpc measurements and show a gain factor 10 times larger than those of a conventional large detector. this enhancement is demonstrated by time - projection experiments performed in water with a water sample of 40 kg in the fermilab mcenter, demonstrating the potential for powerful event - tracking instruments.
we analyze the phase behaviour of mixtures of two - dimensional hard rods using scaled particle theory ( spt ) calculations. we focus on mixtures containing hard rectangles as one of the components, with the other being a hard discorectangle, what we have called _ crossed _ mixtures, in which the geometry of the particles induces a tetratic phase ( n@xmath0 ) which is stabilised with respect to their spatial area. our main result is that the isotropic uniaxial nematic phase, which usually demixes due to lack of long range order in two dimensional systems, never exhibits such a demixing mechanism. in particular, in the case of hard squares of different aspect ratios, which are not very dissimilar, at least for large aspect ratios the mixture does not exhibit segregation or tetrasis, and the resulting phase diagram shows a variety of new features, such as a triple phase, triple critical, azeotropic and critical end points. in a particular case, hard squares can orient along either a particular direction or the orthogonal direction equally easily, independently of affecting the phase diagram significantly. however, when they interact with a neighbour particle, the orientation of the hard sphere can be strongly distorted, and results in a common phase which is only stable for a very small range of particle area fraction. in this case, the resulting distribution of dimensionality plays an important role, since local entropic effects associated with packing may completely preempt kosterlitz thouless ( kt ) type effects. our results demand for additional computer simulations on the freely rotating hard square model, which, admittedtly, is the only real way to identify the mechanisms responsible for the above observed differences and similarities between the two dimensional mixtures. = 10000 * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron * * + * desy 16 - 194 october 2016 @xmath1 * phase transitions, crystalline and liquid crystalline phases in two- and three dimensional hard rod mixtures@xcite - * deutschke universitt erlangen - nrnberg * + corresponding author, desy, geismarlandstr. 31, d-18000 bethesda, denmark.
we use numerical simulations to study the effect of star formation on structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the milky way galaxy. two star formation models are examined, a low-@xmath0 model with a threshold density of @xmath1 ( @xcite ) and a medium - density model ( @xik0 model ). we find that the two models can produce a similar schmidt - kennicutt relation in the phase diagram, if the threshold density is chosen according to the local star formation rate ( sfr ) and the total mass in dense gas clumps is allowed to evolve from the ism to the stellar disks. the difference between the models comes from the fact that the high - density region converts into stars and supernova feedback blows out the surrounding dense gas in runs c and d. in the latter case, the gas from the reservoir to the star forming regions first has a log - normal like probability density distribution ( pdf ), while the low - density tail of the pdf has a power - law like form in a self - gravity dominated system. the complexness of the gas disks is almost the same to a similar degree. we argue that the evolution timescale in the multiphase ism is essentially independent of the star formation efficiency parameter, which is indicated by the well - known jeans condition. for the both models, the vertical scale of star particles is found to be comparable to the observed one. thus our results imply that the global sfhs and the relation of surface gas density to surface sfr are not changed by the choice of the threshold value for star formation. we also investigate the evolution of the mass of live halo particles ( e.g., nfw and oh galaxies ). it is found that a very high mass resolution is required to resolve the gaseous phase diagram. on the other hand, a moderate resolution is sufficient to generate ` ` stars '' in the halo. the stars are created either by heating of the dense gas due to sn feedback or by star formation feedback. we discuss the implications of our results for the assembly of live dark matter halos.
we use a sample of 21@xmath0 m mips observations from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to study the evolution of dwarf galaxies in the coma supercluster ( @xmath1 ), with the aim of understanding the link between star formation and large - scale structure and galaxy evolution. in agreement with previous studies, we find that dwarf galaxies are star - forming everywhere. using stellar population synthesis models to account for the widespread nature of the k+a population, we show that the massive red dwarfs trace the rich structures in the cluster, groups and the filament of galaxies, while the faint blue dwarfs represent a population that is largely unaffected by the cluster potential well. while the red dwarf galaxies trace the star - density relation of clusters, the blue dwarf galaxies falling into the cluster periphery are effectively quenched on short timescales, suggesting that star formation in these galaxies is not abruptly interrupted but rather it is prolonged as they interact with the cluster environment. given the current constraints on star formation rates in clusters, we suggest that the current star formation rate ( sfr ) could be much higher in the outskirts of clusters than in the central regions, implying a possible evolutionary progenitor scenario for the dominant spiral population of galaxies. in addition, we explore the evolutionary status of the dominant red dwarf population. while some of the galaxies can be transformed into luminous late - type spirals by absorbing part of their hydrogen, most of the luminous dwarfs within the coma cluster are found within the cluster virial radius and remain there unless they are stripped of their gas. we find no difference in evolutionary status between the red and blue dwarf populations. however, there is a clear evolutionary separation among the two classes : there exists a significant population of intermediate - luminosity dwarfs ( k+as ) that line - up along the right - hand side of the equivalent width ( ew ) plane in the vicinity of the cluster centres, while a significant fraction of the former group is found in the periphery. further, the fast - cooling, optically - thick sub - cluster potentials are likely to witness a starburst in the outer regions, before they are assimilated into the core. based on these results, we conclude that starbursts and morphological transitions are inevitable consequences of the hierarchical assembly of clusters.

we study the problem of constructing a time efficient _ self - stabilizing _ verification _ algorithm for a minimum spanning tree ( mst ), that is, a verification scheme that uses just @xmath0 bits of memory per node, with a small memory usage but still uses a deterministic time algorithm to verify the existence of faults. the key feature of the new scheme is that any fault is detected very close to the node where it occurs, within the time window of the mst verification algorithm. as expected, the time complexity of the verification scheme grows logarithmically with the number of bits used, even in synchronous networks. we also adapt the transformer of a known asynchronous mst verifier scheme ( designed by katz and perry, katz & perry @xcite ) so that it may be used with our verification scheme. the result of this adaptation is a significantly better time efficiency than that of previous algorithms. if faults occur after the verification, then the faults are detected within our time window at the time when our algorithm is stopped. this is demonstrated by plugging in the proof labeling scheme of katz, perry & katz ( see the paper they used ). the transformer can be adapted to produce a memory optimal mst construction algorithm with a time complexity that is faster than prior algorithms. in asynchronous networks, we further adapt the known transformer by developing a variant that uses the concept of _ transformer _, whose time complexity is again polynomial in the memory size. it requires only the size of the network ( no matter how small or how long the network is, as long as it has a certain diameter, for verification ), and no more than 1.2 time per node. the new verification scheme produces an algorithm that improves significantly on previous algorithms ( in both synchronous and asynchronous networks ) even in the asynchronous case. moreover, it is shown that even in a synchronous network, the algorithm can be used as a low latency method to detect faults within the ( very short ) time window, if a sufficient detection distance is used. asynchronous network, distributed algorithm, time, synchronization, low complexity
the spectacular comet c/2011 w3 was discovered in preperihelion images by the soho and stereo coronagraphs, revealing a bright, sudden disappearance of the nuclear condensation between december 1620 and december 23, and a development of a narrow, rectilinear dust streamer extending essentially along the comet s axis. we show that the tail development was caused by the combined action of vigorous sublimation of submillimeter - sized dust grains, primarily silicate, atheliocentric distances less than about 1.8 @xmath0, and steady buildup of thermal stress throughout the nucleus, which lasted for more than 4 months and resulted in the release of 10@xmath1 grams of dust ( equivalent to a sphere 150 - 200 meters across ). model calculations show that this ` ` missing nucleus '' was likely the first of a new, 21st century cluster of bright kreutz - system sungrazers, predicted by these authors in 2007. the present - day location of the missing nucleus can be traced to the point of intersection of the spine tail s synchrone and the line of orbital - period variation observed in the december 17.6 image. an orbital solution for the orbit is derived based on previous observations made with the astrometric technique of malargue, which gives the most accurate position of the nucleus s position on the plane of forced orbital period at the time of termination of observations in december 19. this solution also gives the first verification of the inferred orbital period for this object. the orbit gives essentially the same value as the one derived in the earlier, more sensitive images and suggests that it is near the aphelion terminus of a previous activity. the steady increase in thermal stress at the center of the coma nucleus throughout its evolution provides a clue to the probable nature of the breakup mechanism ; it is characterized by a gradual penetration of heat pulses into the inner hole excavated by the erosion at the surface and a symmetric distribution of the heat pulses inside the nucleus. taken together, these results support a scenario in which the nucleus disintegration is caused by a catastrophic collision ( or catastrophic collapse ) with a massive tidal wave, followed by a sustained phase of spontaneous cascading fragmentation.
we describe the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iv ) integral - field unit ( ifu ) plugplate system, the calibration system, and the hardware for the ongoing ( sdm - ifr ) catalog of nearby galaxies ( called manga ). the ifu plugplate has 6 cartridges, each of which contains a plugplate with a field of view @xmath0 in diameter that has been pre - drilled with holes corresponding to the locations of bright optical sources and ifus. we use ifus to down - select the 3,000 ifu if needed for object observation, and down - level the remaining 5000 if required for spectrophotometric calibration. this method of down - selecting determines the position of each ifu in the data cube. in preparation for observing, we characterize the data quality in terms of field differential refraction and dither. we simulations using the batchelor & efstathiou ( 1989 ) dither pattern demonstrate that dither causes a 25 % decrease in mean signal - to - noise ratio at a fixed ifu over a certain baseline observing strategy, and also that this effect is significantly reduced if we use a variable dither scheme to achieve uniform, integral - coverage coverage of the field. we also simulate the effect of fiber packing irregularities and find that the resulting image profile can not be linearly symmetric in a given ifu. we therefore explore alternatives such as dithered observations and a tapered ifu ferrule configuration. each simulation reproduces the same image profile, but the fidelity in the three - dimensional data cube is compromised by unusual fiber packing. these effects limit the ability to reach high s / n performance with this hardware, and we conclude that it will be critical to monitor the fidelity of the reconstructed image profile to distinguish between different ifu fiber bundles.

we propose a new class of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ), hereafter grb, characterized by an occasional softer extended emission lasting in the order of a few seconds, similar to the ones observed by norris & bonnell, but lasting longer than the ` ` long '' grbs. grb970228 ( @xmath0 s ) is the prototype for this new class, and it provides a theoretical explanation for the apparent absence of the so - called ` ` amati relation '', which is observed for almost all ` ` canonical grbs '' with redshift and an isotropic peak energy in the burst prompt emission. we study the temporal and spectral properties of the grb prompt emission for the new class and we show that the leading contribution of the afterglow peak emission after the primary prompt emission of the p - grb event is always negligible. for all the grbs for which we have a reasonable estimate of the time integrated luminosity ( most of them ), the prompt emission consists of three components : a strong initial spikelike emission, followed by a soft bump, and a late extended feature with a luminosity significantly smaller than the initial ` ` spikelike '' component, indicating the presence of a ` ` fake '' grb. in this case, the relative energy of the different components is negligible compared to the total amount of emitted in each component. the late extended emission is accompanied by a set of three additional pulses of decreasing intensity. we identify the first main pulse originating from the center of the fireball that propagates between the start of the second peak and the end of the third pulse. the peak of the last of these three pulses coincides with the final ` ` real '' long grb of the year, providing evidence for the physical connection between the two long grbs and the circumburst medium. we also point out the existence of a correlation between the total burst energy and the peak energy euv-@xmath1, or the isotropically emitted energy in bursts with only a single long burst in the past. this correlation is expected to be present for all grbs that are characterized by a short duration, as in the case of grb050509b and grb060218, but not for those that have been classified as ` ` short ''.

we present the results of a sensitive multi - component optical to sub - mm survey of blazars carried out using the _ herschel _ pacs and spire instruments between 100 and @xmath0 m wavelength bands covering the equatorial fields of the astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas ). this is the largest such survey, covering an area of 270 arcmin@xmath1 with pacs, and provides a unprecedented opportunity to obtain flux density limited, continuum - limited samples of submillimetre - wave selected blazar candidates. we present results for a sample of 379 sources selected from the bzcat catalogue using this selection, of which 379 are detected at optical wavelengths. the catalogue contains 66535 unique objects, 26369 of which are detected in the 9h field, 12686 in the 12h field and 27480 in the 15h field. we have investigated the behaviour and nature of the selected sources by means of diagnostic diagrams devised to assess the nature of their non - thermal continuum emission. the diagnostic diagrams are validated by comparing the selected candidates to a set of model optical spectra constructed from literature data and with our own calibrated photometry. while the majority of the sources tested are found to be consistent with optically thin synchrotron emitters, a small number exhibit evidence of thermal dust emission, typically one or two sources in the 10s of percent of the sample. the evidence is weak for a pure thermal component, while almost all the sources require at least at least one component. however, some evidence is found for the presence of such components in at least a few sources. we discuss the implications of these results for the blazar host galaxies, and conclude that some of the flat - spectrum radio quasars may be accreting star - forming galaxies contaminated by dust emission from their own host galaxies.

we present synthetic integrated colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of 66 galactic open clusters, 745 lmc clusters and 238 smc clusters. the cmds are constructed using the technique described by chiosi et al. ( 1992 ) for sequential star generation, distribution of stars along a given isochrone and the initial mass function ( imf ) of the cluster. the colour evolution of main sequence population ( ms ) in the milky way and in the magellanic clouds is estimated. we also calculate integrated parameters for the whole cluster population as well as for the ms population of star clusters. we find that the relation between integrated colours of ms population and ms population are fairly explained by the model predictions obtained in the present study. this indicates that the present data fairly represent the ms populations of the mc clusters. stochastic fluctuations are considered in the study. maximum of the colour fluctuations is in the age range 6.7 @xmath0 log ( age ) 0.5. the evolution of integrated magnitude and colours of synthetic clusters having salpeter mass function and various assumed values of metallicity are given in tables 1 and 2. a sample of the tables are available in electronic form only. integrated colours for the cluster population ( main sequence and evolved cluster population ) are reported here for the first time using the method developed in the paper by brocato & charlot ( 2002 ). the results obtained in this paper are in good agreement with the original model. the @xgg0 colour evolution for the presented data is given in the range 7.7 7.8. for the ss population of the lmc and smc, the data are also consistent with the model. a comparison of the present results with the observational data from rz05 indicates that most of the observed data are fairly well explained by ms population. however, towards the smc and lmc, majority of the data indicates the incompleteness of the model and thus the validity of the adopted imf for ssps.

in recent years, the advances in accelerator and polarization techniques have opened up new possibilities for the study of polarized particle interaction processes. the most widely used method for this purpose consists in the covariant bogush - fedorov approach [ 1 - 5 ], in which the explicit form of the fundamental matrices and state functions of the lorentz group is used. the general theoretical development of this method is due to sokolov. at the present time this method contains the attractive idea of describing the spin properties of two particles by means of vector parametrizations of the little group. this allows one to avoid the use of auxiliary vectors, which are, in general, unrelated to the kinematics of the problem, therefore inconvenient to work with. also, giving up on the generality of the treatment makes the method more efficient. this is even more true with regard to the method for calculating diagonal amplitudes, because the construction of the mathematical formalism for them involves only the 4-momenta of the particles participating in the reaction. in the dsb this does not lead to loss of generality, since the spin projections on the direction of particle momentum are calculated only in the helicity basis. the new expressions derived for the amplitudes admit a simple partial - wave analysis, and thereby simplify the calculations. we review here the main results of our study of specific quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) processes. we develop expressions for the matrix elements of the transition from the initial to the final state ( without and with spin flip ), as well as for the annihilation results of two charged - pair nucleon - nucleon reactions. we also study the proton - proton recoil scattering at rest and at large accelerators. the results are discussed in the context of the large accelerator program at the relativistic heavy - ion collider cern. address = department of physics, brookhaven national laboratory, upton, ny 11973, usa, altaddress = institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt rostock, d-85747 garching, germany address = inaf - osservatorio astronomico di brera, via emilio bianchi 46, i-23807 merate ( lc ), italy address = laboratoire de physique thorique et hautes energies universit de paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex, france address
the evolution of helium - core white dwarf ( he wd ) models with progenitors having much lower metallicities than the solar metallicity is studied. the progenitor models are evolved from the end of the mass - loss phase down to the very advanced phases of evolution. the binary nature of our wd models has been simulated by abstracting mass from a 1 m@xmath1 model at appropriate stages of its evolution off the main sequence. moreover, an appropriate non - gray treatment for the atmosphere that accounts for energy transfer by radiation and convection has been employed to derive the outer boundary conditions of our evolving models. the main results of this work are : i ) important improvements have been incorporated into our model atmospheres to provide accurate colours and magnitudes for both early and advanced stages of the cooling. ii ) at fixed effective temperature, we find a temperature separation between very hot he wds with and without cno thermonuclear flashes. for the case of @xmath0= 0.001 we confirm a previous finding of serenelli et al. ( 2001 ) that the colour indices are bluer at low effective temperatures. iii ) we find the existence of a mass threshold for the occurrence of diffusion - induced cno flashes that leads to an age dichotomy ( particularly for the mass below 0.able ) between early models and late models with very thick hydrogen envelopes. iv ) we revise the lower bound on the initial mass of the minumumum stellar mass and we find that there is a critical mass below which any diffusion - related instability occurs. in most of the cases we confirm this finding, but for the most of them we provide sub - stellar mass estimates. v ) as a result of the chemical diffusion processes, our models predict a shorter cooling age for the more massive models ( up to 0.4 gyr ) than for the less massive ones. vi ) we explore the possibility of several pp - induced hydrogen shell flashes taking place during the evolution and find that the amount of hydrogen burning that is necessary to keep these flashes stable is of the order of those expected for the formation of weakly leptonic pulsars. using calculations for pre - wd evolutionary phases of our models, we identify some candidates for these flashes and we discuss their importance in the interpretation of recent and future observations.

we report the results of a detailed analysis of the radio emission from sagittarius a *, a radio source thought to coincide with the black hole. we find that the radio spectrum from cm to mm wavelengths can not be produced by thermal bremsstrahlung within a bounded accretion flow. the thermal emission must be produced at larger radii, in the circularization region where the infalling gas evolves from quasi - spherical accretion toward a settled keplerian configuration at smaller radii. this inner region also accounts for the observed long wavelength emission, which may be due to free - free absorption in the ionized gas. the cyclo - synchrotron emissivity at mm wavelengths is a telling character for this emission, and it provides a telling discriminant between the two principal mechanisms for producing the high - energy emission in this source. we demonstrate that a magnetic field dominated by its azimuthal component, inferred from earlier magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( brandenburg et al. 1996 ), is not sufficient to produce the mm bump, or the x - ray emission from this source, without additional _ thermal _ radiative processes. we conclude that the thermal component is essential but not the dominant one in the turbulent inner region. if the mm emission is due to nonthermal electrons, as appears plausible given the power - law characteristics of the accretion gas, then the nonthermost electrons must have contracted to small values and thus failed to exchange energy with the thermal electrons. this situation may be understood in the context of angular momentum conservation in turbulent accretion flows, since the angular momentum associated with the motions of the electrons is short - lived ( e.g., @xmath0 years ), and is usually produced at large distances from the event horizon. finally, we show that the inclination of the fundamental plane in the plane of the sky is a strong function of the local magnetic field strength, and we provide empirical evidence that this has important implications for the formation of radio galaxies.
we present a calculation of the star formation rate surface density distribution function in the northern hubble deep field based on a combination of optical and submillimeter observations of the region covered by the nicmos and wfpc2 nicmos hdf. this analysis employs a novel technique to determine the extinction of individual galaxies from the integrated fluxes of external galaxies and dust without assuming a universal distribution of dust emission. we compare the results with those from extinction corrected standard templates that have been used in the literature, but without redshift information. the results from a photometric analysis of these templates indicate that we are measuring the bright end of a distribution that is independent of redshift. this distribution is in good agreement with the rates recently derived from far infrared observations of distant galaxies. we also present an analysis of the consistency of our results with other studies and comment on the implications for the possible evolution of the apparent star formation history of the universe. we find that the extinction corrected star formation rates obtained from our sample are consistent with a constant rate at redshifts between 0.8 and 2.0. the rate for a redshift of 2 is significantly higher than this due to incompleteness in portions of the sample that are too faint to be detected in our previously estimated error bars but that there is a trend for the average extinction correction factor to be upwards of 1.7 within the ` ` 1 @xmath0 '' error bar. errors in the photometric errors due to large scale structure and small number statistics are discussed and the significance of this result is discussed. we discuss the implications of these results for models for reionization by stars in the early universe and for the role of dust in the formation of the stars and dust in galaxy spectra. we present a prediction of the far infrared fluxes expected for the galaxies in our list. these fluxes are roughly consistent with the values found from @xcite. the comparison between our results and those from optically based studies suggests that a substantial fraction of the uv flux from galaxies is reemitted by dust and/or that this reemitting flux is absorbed and reradiated by the dust in heavily extincted galaxies. # 1to 0pt#1
we study the effect of an extreme form of surface current on dynamical surface growth models using direct numerical simulations. the surface current in these models is ( 111 ) uphill in contrast to the existing ehrlich - schwoebel type instability which is confined to strictly two ( or higher ) dimensions. we identify the conditions under which mounded growth morphologies ( with or without slope selection ) can occur in all dimensions. the instability is shown to favor the two dimensional model most recently discovered by pierre - louis _ et al_. [ phys. rev. lett. * 105 *, 180601 ( 2013 ) ] in its extreme form. we also find the instability to be closely related to an existing nonequilibrium model, the diffusion - limited mobility model ( dt ), in which the negative barrier at the base of a step is the key mechanism for mounding. the wv model in two dimensions grows with a strong uphill current which actually extends up to @xmath0 ml during our simulation time. we verified this effect by analyzing the measured height - height correlation functions of the simulated morphologies. all the models studied here are dynamical limited mobility growth models in which an adatom is allowed to diffuse ( according to specific sets of diffusion rules for each model ) within a finite diffusion length ( e.g. es ). the diffusion process is assumed to be instantaneous and when the adatom has reached its final site, it is incorporated permanently into the substrate. mounding is thus an ubiquitous phenomenon in mbe growth, and is widely considered to be the only mechanism for the formation of mounds. here we discuss a different mechanism, qualitatively distinct from the es barrier induced mounding, which leads to spectacular mound formation. the mechanism underlying the mounding instability discussed in this paper is closely connected to that proposed in two recent publications and may actually apply to a variety of experimental situations where mounding growth ( with slope selection and shape selection ) has been observed.
we study the constraints on the dark - matter couplings of fermionic schwarzschild mirrors ( sd ) operators from direct detection experiments on the nucleon - nucleon annihilation cross section, using the nuclear form factors deduced from neutrino - induced muon - event data and the sd form factors for elastic and proton - sensitive electron - proton scattering. it is found that the combination of a diversity of effective sd operators can lead to different interpretations of the direct detection experimental results, especially in the large wimp mass region that favors a large transferred momentum. for example, when the wimp couples dominantly with proton ( neutron ) over neutron ( proton ), the direct detections turn out to be more effective in excluding the parameter space ( excluding the tensor - to - scalar ratio parameter space ) than the indirect search super - kamionkande and icecube in the region @xmath0 gev. the xenon100 experiment is the most sensitive in this region ( at least 90 % detection sensitivity ), due to its sensitivity to a larger transferred momentum, which is the typical range of wimp masses. we also find that a light mediator with a massless force carrier will give a good representative description of a weakly interacting wimp with a low but finite mass for capture. 0.1 cm _ pacs : _ 12.38.mh, 14.40.lx, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm astrophysics laboratory of theoretical physics cern, department of physics, + university of washington, september 2009 + _ dark matter as a candidate for the dark matter @xcite proposed by dahlem, mehboudi, alexandrov, and vaidman, phys. rev. d1, universit de toulouse ; ups, insa, ut1, utm + institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, + fhringer ring 6, d-35392 toulse, germany _ _ keywords : _ direct detection, dark matter, muon, electron, proton, neutron, wimp, nucleon, elastic scattering
we re - visit the double pulsar system 1987a which had a progenitor zams mass of @xmath0 and a binary companion. we update the basic scenario of this system and others in which compact objects with helium white dwarfs go through common envelope evolution in the evolution of binary neutron stars, ending up as luminous black holes ( lmbhs ). we show that the masses of the compact objects are very similar to those of the fe cores. the reason is that the neutron star mass increases very rapidly with the companion mass. at the end of the main sequence evolution there is a relatively small amount of mass remaining in the envelope, mainly due to the gravitational influence of the companion. therefore, the compact object mass can be used as a rough estimate for the total white dwarf mass. we then extrapolate the population synthesis procedure to expected masses of compact objects in binaries with compact companions. we include the masses in the previous work of bethe, brown, & lee ( 2003 ) and use it extensively to connect the various objects we have observed and studied. in particular, we emphasis the similarities and differences in the number of mergers and binary separations among the very few very massive binaries in which both stars are massive enough so that they can be considered as a mass transfer in case bh - ns binaries. in this scenario, the differences in mass of the pulsar and its companion are the main reason that makes the merger more probable than in the case where neither star is a white dwarf ( woosley rate of 170 kev barns ). in the current scenario for binary pulsars, most of the separation distance is taken out of the range which is clearly indicated by the very existence of mass degeneracy among the more massive binaries. we also discuss the evolution and mass distribution of the carbon - oxygen white dwarf binaries j1141@xmath456545 and b2303 + 4745, which have quite massive white dwarf companions, and show that they come from quite massive systems. in that case the _ mass distribution _ is quite similar to that of the red giant stars in the solar neighborhood. thus the _ masses _ of the _ compact objects coming from these two systems are quite similar. we conclude that the _ convergence _ in mass will be the main mechanism for the formation of very high - mass bhs in the galaxy. # 1/#2.1em.5ex-.1em /-.15em.25ex # 1to 0pt#1 subject headings : binaries :
we present the results of an analysis of model atmospheres for six o dwarf stars in the central region of the small magellanic cloud. we have used the photospheric program, tlusty, and the unified model code, cmfgen, to derive stellar parameters and wind parameters. consistent with earlier results, the stellar winds are weak and the mass loss rate is small. the and resonance doublets are a weak signature of the stellar wind ( a weak, blueshifted, absorption components ), while the line of @xmath271371 does not reveal any indication of a stellar wind. we obtain effective temperatures that are about 7000k lower than @xcite relations for o4v stars, while they are 3000 to 3500k lower for later o stars. the early spectral types attributed to mpg 324 and mpg 368 may be an artefact due to the filling of lines by nebular emission. we confirm that the difference in metallicity between the far - uv and the visible nebular spectrum can be attributed to the neglect of line blanketing in earlier model atmosphere calculations. the magnitude of the change in metalticity is not as extreme as the ones found for 4-v o supergiants in the smc and in the lmc. we derive a n / c abundance ratio slightly above solar, in agreement with the adopted carbon abundance. our adopted wind model predicts thus too high a nitrogen ionization in the wind of mpg 355. the chemical abundances derived from the model atmosphere are consistent with the _ expected _ nitrogen enrichment at the stellar surface caused by the nuclear burning of h@xmath11 by the compressive nitrogen enrichment in the metal - rich stellar wind of, say, mpg 3332. the derived mass loss rates of the three most luminous stars are _ not _ extreme, being consistent with theoretical predictions. other stars in our sample show stronger emission at higher effective temperatures, suggesting a different origin of the non - lte helium lines. however, the ne / c ratios expected by the nlte models are in question.
the behavior of one - electron atomic - molecular systems placed in a strong magnetic field is investigated by means of a phenomenological model. the model is based on a surprisingly simple physical idea that the ground state depends on a ratio of transverse to longitudinal size of a system placed in the magnetic line. the exotic molecular ion @xmath0 appears as a quasi - stationary state of constant electronic density at a strong field. through fitting the data from the recent theoretical studies @xcite, it is shown that this one - parametric behavior is characterized by a change of the form of the electron cloud, which can be roughly approximated by the ratio of two classical parameters, i.e., the _ larmor radius _ and the _ binding energy _ of free electron in magnetic field ( the larmor energy ). with the same idea of approximation, we construct accurate approximation approximations for the exotic @x0 ion. the main strength of this model is related to the fact that the difference between the sizes of the transversal and longitudinal electron clouds is practically zero for any value of the magnetic field strength. thus, with a very large magnetic field, the magnetic cloud contracts in a slow way and shows a needle - like form known as the _ ruderman needle_. meanwhile, the size of the longitudinal cloud shrinks drastically at large magnetic fields but at a much more moderate rate. similar kinds of behavior occurs also for the other one - electrons ions @xma@xmath1. + [ multiblock footnote omitted ] + + k.bolmatov@gmail.com, + * z.h.ball@bnl.gov * keywords : * atomic and molecular ions, magnetic fields, electron clouds, bose - einstein condensation, x - ray absorption and emission, planets, stars : individual ( black hole, neutron star ), background quasars, and x - rays.
in this paper, we study the evolution of the luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation for 64 dgss galaxies using absorption line spectra from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) survey. we find that galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 are bluer by 0.2 - 1.0 mag than their local counterparts at the same redshift. the galaxies have gas - phase oxygen abundances which are similar to those of luminous local galaxies. using the correlation between b - band luminosity and ism oxygen abundance found by carollo & lilly ( 2001 ), we determine that the local galaxies were nearly identical to the present - day luminous galaxies, i.e., l@xmath1 - 0.7. however, we find no significant evolution in the slope of the fundamental plane ( fp ) with redshift among luminous, blue galaxies in this sample. we interpret this result as evidence that the uv - bright, intermediate - redshift galaxies have similar chemical enrichment levels as local galaxies, but are brighter and bluer on average at higher luminosity. a plausible explanation for the effect is a combination of effects from starbursts and supernova - driven winds. if the star formation in local galaxies proceeds radially from the inside - out, the fp in these objects is determined by the amount of fading over a wide range of galactocentric radii. we can find no set of model parameters which reproduces the current data sufficiently well to be consistent with the simple evolution we find out on the basis of luminosities and metallicities. semi - analytic models of somerville & primack ( 1999 ) predict a decrease in the mean mass - to - light ratio with lookback time for elliptical galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson 1997 ). our data indicate that this result is already well explained by local chemical enrichment and is not a consequence of the cosmic growth process.
a proposal is presented for a method to _ directly _ measure the electric dipole moments ( edm s ) of electrons and protons with unprecedented accuracy, without depending on simultaneous circulating beams. the method uses a resonant, longitudinal polarimeter that responds to the longitudinal magnetization of the polarized beam. with the longitudinal component of the polarization vector and the roll frequency measured separately, the method can be used to _ eliminate _ short - range, high - order mdm induced precession errors by measuring the edm at the maximum possible accuracy, of order @xmath0e - cm. various theoretical and experimental predictions are included. this method will allow a precise measurement of the deuteron edm, and may allow a three - order - of - magnitude improvement in edm accuracy over previous storage ring storage ring proton edm experiments. _ desy 09 - 185 issn 0418 - 9833 + july 2009 + * storage ring edm measurement with + counter - circulating beams * + a. a. koop@xcite has proposed a ` ` spin wheel '' in which, using a conveniently small molecular mdm, the vertical beam displacement is measured as the difference of two positions, each of which is being measured using bpm s. this yields the spin precession rate ( and, by extension, magnetic field uncertainty ) as the inverse of the transverse ( longitudinal ) magnetization vector. the rolling polarization alteration ( first proposed by koop ) shifts the signal to a higher frequency, allowing the use of a phase - locked, rolling polarization trap. this, and later, resonant polarimetry, will transform the beam s magnetic field information into the frequency domain for fast measurement. koop s proposal is different from the ` ` pedm - frozen '' method, in which simultaneous beams are not required to suppress the resulting spurious edm signal. the present proposal enables measurements of the electron edm with accuracy comparable to, or better than, the neutron edm. + _ key words _ : non - relativistic dirac - like particles, electromagnetically - neutral quasiparticles, storage ring electrons and positrons, transverse magnetization, mdm non - conservation, electroweak interactions
we present a detailed re - analysis of the time - averaged epic - pn spectrum of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15, obtained with the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ), following iwasawa et al. ( 1996 ). this marks the most detailed study of the deep minimum state of this source to date. we first re - examine the so - called ` ` difference spectra '' presented in paper i, which showed that the extreme central concentration of iron line emission required to describe the observed breadth and redshift of the line profile in this object suggests that the central black hole is rapidly rotating. we build new relativistic smearing functions using the generalized thin disk accretion model of agol & krolik ( 2000 ) that includes a torque applied at the radius of marginal stability @xmath1, and find that this torque is dominating the energetics of the system, even when one uses self - consistent models for the absorption by a thermal comptonised absorber ( that include comptonisation ). by using a simple power - law broad line model as a reference, we measure an average 210kev continuum curvature of -1.7degree at a fixed equivalent width. this is at odds with the findings of previous investigations, which indicate a much larger deficit of continuum flux in this source. we also find that the spectral variability of the iron line features is strongly correlated with the overall source flux, and that the data are consistent with a source being radiating primarily via an infinite - efficiency disk. in other words, one may have to conclude that this accretion disk is extracting the black hole s spin energy. we present evidence that this disk is highly torqued and, at this instant in time, the data do not support the suggestion that this may be a rapidly - rotating kerr black hole. in addition, we test the results of paper i by determining whether there are any gross changes in the spectral features of the x - rays that might shear off the disk and smear the deep - minimum state iron line. we find no significant change in the velocity profiles or fluxes in the 10k long difference spectrum, indicating that the source is not significantly different in its gas properties from what is found in the 1500kev region.
we investigate the current rarity of binary - source - lensing ( bsl ) events, which comprise the majority of detected microlensing events, due to the fact that only a single candidate event has been reported so far. using realistic simulations, we find that the very low detection rate for bsl events can not be explained by the multiplicity of microlensed source and lens stars. the observed bsl light curve is usually a superposition of the light curves of the individual source stars and is represented by a gaussian with the amplifications of the component binary source stars. therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the bsl event from a single source lensing event with similar source star amplifications. we define ` detectable bsl sn1'events as those events whose light curves can be distinguished from those of a single lensed event with a high confidence level and size, and we show that the fraction of such events with equivalent source star impact parameters is substantial, reaching as much as @xmath0. however, even with this high degree of precision, the probability of detecting the actual basl event is still very low, under the assumption that the lens and source stars are widely separated according to the typical size of the einstein ring. several reasons are investigated to explain this fact. first, if the flux ratio between the primary and secondary source stars is very large, making the light curve of the bright star hardly affected by the light from the faint star, resulting in an effect of light dilution with small amplifications, like that of a diluting a star light curve. second, the separation is too small, leading to a missing of events with large impact parameters due to a lack of time resolution in the source band. third, the magnifications of source stars with the largest amplifications mimic those of the lensing events with longer timescales and/or larger values of the impact parameters. to determine the origin of this effect, we propose a new criterion based on the orbital periods of g dwarfs in the macho lmc, which should be used with great caution to distinguish between photometric and spectroscopic samples of massive astronomical halo objects.
we investigate the orbital evolution of planets orbiting binaries undergoing orbital decay via the lk+tide " mechanism, in which the inner binary is driven by distant tertiary companions. such a mechanism is known to lead to the formation of very misaligned planets, such as the circumbinary planets that have formed on the laplace surface ". in this scenario, if planets on circular orbits adiabatically follow an equilibrium solution as the triple system evolves, becoming misaligned with their host binary ; the final misalignment angle increases rapidly with inclination. we find that planets may survive the orbital decay of the binary for initial inclinations near the nominal lk period, but may have a very high probability of being on a misaligned orbit as a result of the tidal torque exerted by the tertiary companion. we estimate that planets with orbital decay rates @xmath0 can form within a hubble time if the binary has a semimajor axis close to the proper, moderate inclination stellar triple. in the absence of secular secular perturbations, planets born on misaligned orbits may evolve into stable, misaligned states between 1 and 10 au. such planets may be observed as the final member of a hierarchical triple, and may be the progenitors of the majority of compact binaries, if they are born within stellar triples with high inclination. in our scenario, the total mass of a planet in the wrong orbit is likely to be too small to be observable, even with the next generation of telescopes. however, the high inclination binary may be responsible for the detection of planets within the stellar triple at very high eccentricities, as has been shown to be the case for a few pairs of stars.

the monte carlo ( mc ) code evolfmc solves the evolution equations for the parton distribution functions and parton momentum distributions by means of the mc simulation of the multiple emission of partons in the cascade. the emission process is of the markovian type, i.e. each emission depends on the information from the previous emission only. the mc parton shower codes provide the complete tree of parton emissions during evolution which can be recombined into one, which is needed for any realistic analysis. so far the mc methods have not been considered considered as a realistic alternative to the other numerical methods of solving the standard dglap evolution equations due to the low precision and long time of computation. the presented mc code evffmc is intended to fill - in this gap. it uses the c++ language to construct the mc event generator library which supplies the four - momenta of emitted quarks and gluons, the actual parton emission processes and the statistical information on the hadron structure. the code can be compiled as a single package and runs on linux and mac os x. it has a user - friendly command - line interface and the ability to migrate to a free open - source environment. the first version of the code is presented here and the status is known. the second version is under development and will be released in the near future. * cern - th/2003 - 287 * + * december 2003 * * the cern computer physics group, department of physics, theory division, + ch-1211 geneva, switzerland * * pacs number(s ) : 11.10.-a, 11.15.-r * keywords : * event generators, parton showers, markov chain, mc, emission process, non - perturbative qcd, radiative corrections, ccfm * program summary * + _ title of program _ : evolfmercury + _ version _ : 1.0 + _ program obtained from _ : cpc program library, queen s university of belfast, n. iree computer physics laboratory, notkestrasse 85, bldg. 2a, d-10115 - 31, nlo, belle + _ computer _ : any computer with c++ compiler and unix - like operating system + _ operating system _ : linux ( with osx ) + _ programming language used _ : fortran 90 + _ memory required to execute with typical data _ : about 2.0 mb. + _
the paper proposes a new explanation of the pioneer anomaly : the difference between the observed light speed and the proper time @xmath0 is an effect of the gravitational potential of all the universe. this is based on two different definitions of the light speed : ( i ) in the formalism of general relativity, it is assumed that all the matter and energy in the universe are uniformly distributed, so that the reference frame of the theory is a null geodesic, and ( ii ) the contrary is the case in a cosmological and global consideration of time. it is claimed that all these phenomena are compatible with a progressive decrease of the permeability and permittivity of empty space, the consequence being a very small acceleration of light. the purpose of this paper is to propose a relativistic version of the newtonian model, based on the application of the fourth heisenberg relation to the sea of virtual electron - positron pairs which, combined with the expansion of the universe, would produce a progressively decreasing of the optical density of the quantum vacuum. possible implications of this model for the acceleration of the clocks are discussed. * the paper presented here refines and strengthens the original idea presented in @xcite : a constant speed of light is, in general, a result of the fermi motion and of the background gravitational field. as a consequence, the pull of the magnetic field would be following then and after only one period, the phenomenon would be known as the pioneer riddle ", for lack of any adiabatic component in the acceleration spectrum. + * msc codes : * 11.10.kent, 12.20.mg, 13.85.-t + * keywords : * acceleration of clocks, theory of relativity, non - proper acceleration, gravity + * pacs numbers : * 98.80.bp, 98.86.kq, 04.90.+x
we introduce a minimal model of distributed supervisory control of electricity systems that incorporates the salient features of real - world control systems. we show that the ability to suppress cascades is dramatically affected by the topology of the control network. in particular, if the supervising network is mono - centric and the number of times a device is solicited _ i.e. _, it tries to dissipate its excess load is close to one, then the system is in a state of ` effective percolation'with ( percolating ) probability @xmath0. cascades are initiated by assuming an external event that removes an edge, its load, and some of its nearest neighbors. we test the fragility of this model against failure cascades by means of computer simulations. to do so, we repeatedly generate instances of the system, each time initiating a cascade according to a ` fallen tree'approach that is, an unspecified external event removes a edge that is connected to the system. if the failing edge is supervised, then it is removed from the system at random. in the event that the average load is too large compared to the threshold that cascades can no longer operate, we determine the upper bound on the cascade size that must be achieved and implement it according to the delaunay triangulation formalism. for large systems, we find that it is not possible to achieve a significant reduction of the size of the largest connected component ( the largest single connected component of the underlying electricity network ) without reducing the average loads carried by the control devices. finally, we also consider the case of control devices having an inherent rate - of failure and we show, in agreement with previous work, that for each value of the above threshold, the fraction of disconnected nodes is bounded by a quantity that can be thought of as the inherent reliability of a control device. we believe that these results make a first step in understanding distributed superselection control, whilst also providing helpful guidelines to designers and administrators of real systems.
a classification of all independent deuteron observables in compton scattering off an unpolarised, vector, tensor or mixed - polarised spin-@xmath0 target is presented. the observables include the cross section, beam asymmetry, @xmath2 target asymmetries and, for the first time, polarisation transfer observables. the helicity amplitudes are expressed in terms of the helicities and related to previously used, incomplete parametrisations. since each observable readily translates into specific and well - known beam / target / detector combinations, the method is then applied todeuteron compton observables to study the polarisabilities of the individual nucleon. where possible, the amplitudes which are complete at the energy scale from the electric - magnetic multipole bound to the nucleon are obtained by parametrizing the convolved nucleon - nucleon interactions. in this way, they parametrise the bi - refringence which the electromagnetic field associated with the spin degrees causes in the nucleons. the multipolarity of the incident photon is dependent on the angle between the pole and the dipole axis, while the photon - hadron interaction has a spin - dependent effect on the hadronic response. these are the most important sources of uncertainties in the determination of the proton - neutron mass shift and in two - photon - exchange contributions to the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen. a comprehensive classification of independent amplitudes and observables is thus warranted, including a detailed study of dependencies on scalar and spin polarisability. as a first step towards this goal, several single and double polarisation observables are presented for different choices of photon virtuality and polarization. what is more, some deuterons are shown to actually receive contributions from both vector and tensor polarisations. while several tensor observables have been constructed before ( see e.g. @xcite ), this work proposes a systematic study of all ( spin - independent and vector - polarisation ) observables with an eye towards potential experiments.
we present a detailed investigation of geometric and electronic properties of bi- and multi - layers of silicene with different stacking configurations for stacking configurations carried out in the framework of the projector augmented wave method. state - of - the - art density functional theory based calculations are carried out for optimization of stackings for number of layers ( @xmath0 = 1 to 10 ) of mono - layer ( ab ), bi - layer of graphene ( aa ), aabb, and abc stackings. for each stacking configuration, we compute the optimized geometric structures of stacking configurations and investigate the related properties such as line widths, bond angles, valence band structures, cohesive energy, semiconductor properties and electronic states of the systems. we clearly show that multi - layer stacked with abc stacking due to the presence of strong inter - layer coupling exists in all the four stacking configurations. the bernal stacking ( abc ) stackings have significantly higher cohesive energy than aaaa stacking. due to this, the two layers of abc are covalently bonded with each other and the bond angles are reduced in comparison to those in aa stacking. as a result, the valence bands in all these stacked configurations have characteristic dispersion around the fermi energy. furthermore, we observe an oscillation in the values of bond angles of atoms in two layers as opposed to that in the structure with abab stacking. the results suggest that the contribution of sp@xmath4 hybridization is increased as compared to that of mon - layer bi - layers. the cohesive energies of aa stacked stacked with the abc stacked structures are higher than those of aaaa and aabb stacked structures. it is observed that the difference in the band structures of bi - layered stacked with aabb stacking and with ab stacking can be explained provided that the aa layer is more elongated. by contrast, the opposite is true for ab stacking. we also show during the evolution of band structure ofbi - layers with increase in the layers separation that the bands of both aa and ab stacking become similar. hence the role of silicon based nanostructures in this transition is revealed.
we study the influence of the magnetic mode on the conductivity of the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state. we focus on the region, around the saddle point, where the quasiparticles of the copper - oxygen planes are coupled to the magnetic excitations. the infrared spectra, observed in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( stis ) of the transition metal oxide ( tmos ), can be well represented and described in terms of a two - particle hamiltonian composed of two bogoliubov states, the nodal region and the intermediate region. the parameters of the model are determined by a delicate competition of the three components, i.e., the excitation energy, the coupling constant and the spin - fluctuation parameter. results are presented in two different codes. the first one is applicable to the case of the onset starting around @xmath1 and the second one is adapted to the situation of the sharp resonance. the quantum numbers of the modes, as determined from the stis data, are shown to be consistent with the values of the effective coupling constant derived from the optical data. the effects of the mode - mode coupling constant as well as the neutron resonance on the onset feature are discussed in the light of the recent experimental data. an important finding is that the ratio between the effective neutron resonance and the contribution of the well - defined mode to the total infrared scattering rate is of the same order of magnitude as those of the contributions of the individual points to the spectral function. the properties of the low - temperature conductivity, particularly its slope and variability, are well described, according to the approach recently developed by carbotte, schachinger, and basov [ phys. rev. lett. * 106 *, 184101 ( 2011 ) ], interms of the s - spin correlator. this technique, however, can not be applied to the htcs in the normal state because of the very weak coherence of the electronic degrees of freedom at higher temperatures. the technique proposed by sandvik, scalapino, and bickers [ j. phys. * c * : condens. matter * * 10 *, 41128 ( 2012 ) ] is not applicable in these materials. their conclusions are in conflict with the experimental findings.
we develop a theory of iron and oxygen abundances in the galactic disc on the basis of a new observational data on abundances of cepheids. we use a statistical method which enables us to evaluate the constants for the rates of synthesis of oxygen and iron without any preliminary assumptions on the progenitors of sne ia. to understand the formation of the above fine structure in the radial distribution of oxygen, we remind the essential features of the differential density wave ( dtd ) function proposed by acharova et al. ( 2011 ) for the analysis of the metallicity distribution of the elements in the solar system. as a result, we obtain the following results : ( i ) in the present interstellar medium, the majority of iron is synthesized by type ia supernovae ( sne ii ) which are thought to be of ages of the order of 100 myr. nevertheless, the total iron produced by each type of sne for the period of time @xmath0 400 myr may be even more massive than that produced by sne ii. ( ii ) the corotation resonance and turbulent diffusion have the effect of producing a smooth distribution of iron which happens to coincide with the observed one of oxygen with a bend in the slope. on the other hand, the impact of spiral arms has to be taken into account when analyzing the distributions of iron along the disc. so, we conclude that the theoretical distributions of both oxygen and oxygen are most probably shaped by the combined effect of these two effects. ( iii ) by means of a power - like dtd function, we have to convert the theoretical radial distributions of oxygen to metallicities using the quantities ( log(z_i / z_{i,\odot})$ ] ) previously derived for the milky way and use the latter to explain the observed abundance pattern of carbon. ( iv ) the absorption cross - section for iron is estimated to be about log(x / i \odot}$ ] which is consistent with the present data.
we study a variety of models for the efficiency and escape fraction of ionizing photons that escape from galaxies during the epoch of reionization. we consider flat @xmath0cdm models with varying cosmological parameters as well as parameters related to star formation and metal enrichment. we assess the ability of these models to satisfy constraints from metal enrichment, escape fractions and the luminosity function of ly@xmath1 galaxies as a function of these parameters. we find that models with very massive stars that form stars and are enriched in metals have difficulty in escaping the igm. more massive stars, while more metal rich, are expected to enrich the ism in a similar manner. this is an indication of the fact that the products of nuclear fusion that takes place in the core of massive stars can be used to limit the amount of early star formation. the only way this can happen is if the efficiency of star formation falls in the range suggested by recent x - ray data. alternatively, there is a possibility that the metallicity of gas that forms stars in early universe could be much larger than previously assumed. we also explore the possibility of using ionizing photon escape fractions as a proxy for the escape fraction from galaxies. with regard to this possibility, we note that escape fractions measured from galaxies are poorly constrained due to the lack of knowledge of escape fractions for early type galaxies. however, by comparing with the thomson optical depth due to free electron scattering detected by the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ telescopes at low redshift, we can make significant contributions to the understanding of the escape process and its correlations with escape fraction and parameter constraints. in particular, it is useful to use this method to assess whether there is any dependence on the initial mass function from which time the maximum in the is emitted by an early stellar population is larger than that of an ism that is enriched by subsequent generations of stars. if we do consider the effect of radiative feedback as disabling star formation then the total gas available for star formation requires slightly higher efficiencies and escape fractions.

background : : the development of experimental techniques to measure spin dynamics in strongly correlated electronic systems is a crucial point in understanding the physics of high dimensional heavy fermion systems. of particular interest are neutron spin echo and muon spin echo experiments which probed different time scales of the spin correlations in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition. here we present a detailed study of these experiments by means of energy resolved neutron diffraction measurements on the d1b spectrometer of the institut lae langevin ( ill ) of the tropperium pyrochlore spinel. results : : at low temperatures, the time scale of the spontaneous neutron spin fluctuations shows three characteristic length scales, ranging from the first neighbor distance to the length scale of about 18 cubic unit cells ( @xmath0 2.5 10@xmath1 ). at 0.1 k, the neutron scattering intensities observed for the 115 and 200 bragg peaks in the diffraction data agree quite well with the temperature variation deduced from the elastic scattering data. at higher temperatures, however, the quasielastic intensity detected by hasegawa _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 105*,190502 ( 2000 ) ], requires a much larger neutron scattering length scale. the energy resolution of the time resolved patterns allows for a clear - cut signature of a static contribution to the intensities probed by the sro not included in the neutron data. in the case of the highest temperature measurement, a large static component is found in the high temperature bragg peak. however, it is difficult to separate the static component from the rapidly fluctuating short scale fluctuations, because of the finite time scale contained in the energy window. the muon, on the other hand, shows a pronounced static peak above 0.8 k, which coincides in time with the freezing timescale of the ground state spin fluctuations. the nature of the static part of the fluctuations is unclear, but it might involve tunnelling or thermally activated excitations between the degenerate states of the parent spin liquid compounds.
the explosions that emanate from quasars or protogalaxies have sometimes been called cosmological blastwaves because they are thought to be related to the intergalactic medium ( igm ). such shocks drag the igm out of the gravitational potential of the host galaxy, sweeping it into denser sheets, eventually forming a blastwave similar to a supernova remnant. theoretical studies have long assumed that the blastwave is adiabatic, as in the thin - shell approximation for supernova remnants. we show that in a universe filled primarily with collisionless matter, the asymptotic radius and shocked mass approach their asymptive values in a flat universe. since the shock front can become self - gravitating upon approaching the maximum radius of the shock, its momentum is conserved in the transformed variables. this is important for determining the nature and evolution of the resulting shock wave. we present an analytical solution for such an equation of state that is directly analogous to the sedov - taylor solution for conduction supernovae remnants. if both the shock and its interior can radiate efficiently, then the shock blastwave momentum is no longer conserved and the size of the final shock front is reduced, reducing the ultimate shock radius and the total amount of mass it can shock. this solution is found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations. in our application we examine whether shocks of such a transverse momentum - conserving shock can affect the temperature and metallicity profiles of the ly@xmath0-bearing igm. we find that the postshock h i column densities of the ambient igm are very little before the shock reaches the maximum shock radius ( @xmath1 ), but blastwaves that interact with preexisting clouds can increase the neutral hydrogen column density by a few times. moreover, if the preheated shell of gas behind the shock is swept up in the shock can become gravitationally unstable, leading to fragmentation of the shell and possibly the formation of lyman - limit clouds or galaxies. we provide an analytical estimate for the number density and energy scale of blastwave sources that can be used to recalibrate the age and mass density of the universe. blastwave - driven winds may produce detectable ultraviolet absorption lines in quasar spectra if the ultraviolet radiation from a massive quasar is integrated over the lifetime of the burst.
the evolution of massive accretion disks with wind infall is investigated for the case of the black hole candidate sgr a * at the center of the milky way. previous hydrodynamic simulations of this process have shown that a large fraction of the dissipated gravitational energy is swept through the event horizon before it can be radiated away. here, we apply our results to the case where the infalling wind is more or less quasi - spherical. these results are incorporated into the one - dimensional evolutionary model that we developed in an earlier paper ( paper i ). while the wind remains within the disk overall, the specific angular momentum deposited by it is less than what is due to the overall dissipation of the energy and hence the resulting luminosity of the disk, decreasing with time the mass accretion rate. this, in turn, allows the disk to have a low x - ray to ir luminosity ratio ( @xmath0 ), reflecting in part the ` ` fossils '' of the accretion history of the region in which the gas is found. thus, although the x - rays are produced by the disk s fossils, the near infrared ( ir ) luminosity is not greatly affected. on the other hand, the ir emission is significantly more obscured and may be dominated by the fossil disk rather than by the intracluster medium ( icl ) or the stellar wind. if the icl or the wind is responsible for the low level of accretion then the entire accretion disk must be captured and incorporated into a single, ` ` fossilized '' structure. in this case, one expects a low rate of mass infall onto the disk with a capture radius of a few times the local solar radius. using a simple advection dominated disk model, we show that this can be interpreted as a result of the captured material carrying a larger keplerian energy than is otherwise required ( or, possibly, advected ) as the wind drifts towards the central object. future hydrodynamical modeling of this system should include the effects of future wind infall on the disk evolution.
we report results from the first study of the qcd phase transition using chirally symmetric lattice fermions, physical quark masses and/or three degenerate pions. values of the inverse lattice spacing are @xmath0 and 200 mev. we show that the axial anomaly leads to anomalous symmetry breaking and that the temperature - dependent disconnected chiral susceptibility increases monotonically with decreasing quark mass. this is in stark contrast to earlier staggered fermion results where the dependence on the screening mass was found to be completely absent. our results demonstrate that qcd s phase transition is not first - order but is a cross - over, consistent with previous staggered and mbius results. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 09 - 050 issn 0418 - 9833 + july 2009 + * qcd with chiral quarks * + _ submitted to physical review d r. ammar,@xmath1 _ pacs number(s ) : 11.10.hi, 11.40.jh, 12.38.kf, 13.60.hq + _ accepted for publication in phys. rev. lett. _ * # 1 * + griffiths _ + _ january 2009, accepted by eur. phys. j. * c * f.d. aaron@phys.j.c. * _ m. aldaya martin, c. alexa, j. albrow, s. barrelet, w. bartel, m. behler, l. betev, a. belousov, p. ben - abdallah, and g. bernardi, ` ` x - ray diffraction - free chiral confinement and dynamics of the transition to quantum chromodynamics, '' _ in _ proceedings of the xliind rencontres de physique thorique ( xi ) conference _ ( tableau de la thorie des phnomnes physiques, new york, 2001 ), pp. 7578. chan, beatev, hatamatsu, hirota, suzuki and yoshihikojiji,``observation of the deconfinement temperature and the pseudo - critical temperature of qcd, _ phys. today _ ( march 31, 2006 ), post deadline. _ the experimental realization @xcite of a qcd insulator has provided strong evidence for the
we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a novel antenna - feedback technique for implementing distributed - feedback ( dfb ) in plasmonic lasers with fabry - prot cavities, which is termed as a novel dfb technique for solid - state lasers. the key concept is to couple the guided electromagnetic ( em ) mode in a spaser s cavity to a single - sided surface - plasmons - polariton ( spp ) mode that can exist in its surrounding medium by periodic perturbation of the metallic cladding in the cavity. such a coupling is established due to the strong bragg diffraction of the spp modes on the metal film that is caused by the cavity s orbital frequency being phase - locked to that of the spaser. single - mode operation is achieved using a grating that is grating of periodicity @xmath0 that is based on a spatial mismatch mismatch between the em and spp waves in the active medium. the method lies in the specific value of the effective periodicity of the grating, which determines the coupling to the em mode. it is conceptually different from conventional dfb methods that have been conventionally utilized for semiconductor lasers, and is demonstrated theoretically along with full - wave three - wave 3d - fem simulation of the beam - patterns. the proposed dfb scheme could be utilized for applications in integrated optics and nanophotonics, in particular for low - threshold and high - temperature heating.,,, 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 h. takesue, ` ` http://www.opticsinfobase.org/~jst/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-13-6-971. m. l. pokrovsky, k. m. horodecki, d. ward, s. w. nguyen, and r. p. salath,``commensurate - mirror terahertz quantum cascade lasers, '' opt. express * 19 *, 2143421445 ( 2012 ). j. zhao, l.- s. sao, x. zhang, and b. d. joannopoulos,``current sources of narrow - beam narrow - band radiation from nanoscale sources of coherent electromagnetic radiation, '' j. lightwave technol. * 24 *, 45544567 ( 2011 ). y. tanaka, t. takahashi, y. kobayashi, h. yam
previous work has shown that lymas can make accurate predictions for the two - point flux distribution and correlations of the ly@xmath0 forest on intermediate and large scales. this performance is essential if one wishes to harness the full potential of n - body / sph simulations for making predictions for cosmological parameters. here we present the formalism for making accurate predictions using a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation and a conditional flux probability distribution. we calibrate this formalism using the @xmath1 marenostrum hydro simulation and make explicit the separation - of - scale philosophy that is implicit in existing methods for making prediction errors up to much larger scales. by combining the dark matter density field with the conditional flux distribution, we obtain a redshift - space flux correlation function ( pdf ) with peculiar velocities set to zero for specific values of the real - space density field. for forward modeling tests, we are able to make spectra that are coherent from pixel to pixel along a single line of sight and have the same cross - sightline statistics as the simple lym asymptotic method in which each pixel flux is drawn independently from the distribution at location 2, even if the latter is optimally tuned to reproduce the unconditional flux pdf of the hydro simulation. as a by - product, we find that the smoothing length needed to match the high - resolution spectra with a regular distribution of particle density and transverse separations is just as large as the number of particles needed to smoothen the pdf at the 3-d level, and is even larger than the separations required in standard deterministic maps. thus, we remain the best method to make mock spectra from a low resolution simulation. however, a significantly smaller simulation volume than boss makes it impossible to calibrate the method accurately on small scales. we have not investigated whether larger dark matter smoothing lengths would be acceptable, or even be of the same order of magnitude or even lower resolution than boss. a final version of the paper is available for download at https://www.lymas.org/.
we present a new study of the central region and bar of the barred spiral galaxy m100, based on sauron integral field observations and _ sst _ near- and mid - infrared imaging. this is the second in a series of two papers presenting results from this study. the first paper presented emission line and gas velocity dispersion maps which showed how massive star formation occurs at the precise locations of relatively cool gas, and related these results to the dynamical origin of the ring in terms of a resonance structure set up by the bar. the low signal - to - noise ratio maps show that the inner and outer parts of the bar, located inside and outside the star - forming nuclear ring, have identical radial elliptical andpa profiles. the ages derived from the absorption line indices from the sauron data are model dependent, but generally agree with the similar h@xmath0 ages found in the region, indicating that the ring and the bar are interacting and have been forming stars for at least the past 3 gyr. the gas velocity field shows two distinct non - circular features, which we interpret as due to streaming motions caused by stars and gas in the nuclear ring. the one - arm and two - arm dust lanes which trace the main bar and ring, are offset inwards through the bar major axis from the location of the shocked gas. the latter features result from the gas being in a disc - like state, with the disc almost circularly rotating along the bar axis. a comparison with the kinematics of the two regions shows that the disc is more inclined to the ring, and has a characteristic rotation angle of @xmath1. the ring shows a bifurcation between the disc and the ring - like side of the disc, with one arm extending nearly to the south - west and the other to the north - east, where we find the old stellar population. the younger stars in the old population are likely to have been formed by a single past star formation event, or by continuous star formation. we construct models of the star formation rate in the ring which satisfactorily reproduce the detailed interplay between the present and recent star formation rates. in addition, these star - formation rates appear to be strongly affected by dust extinction. for instance, a burst of star formation with a duration of 5 gyr can explain the [ oiii ] emission line index of mgfe50.

the _ extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( eit ) and the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ) onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) have provided continuous spectroscopic observations of small - scale solar features during periods of low solar activity for more than two years in 1996 and 2015. analysis of these images reveals a significant decrease of the overall spectral irradiance in the band around the strong heii emission line of 30.4 nm compared to the previous minimum detected in 1996. a detailed analysis of the temporal profile of this change is supported by the addition of pixel noise at a level of about 6.4 dn rms in the eit images. this noise is comparable to the increase in spectral power observed between the 2010 and 2015 dates. thus, the observed increase is not related to an increase in detector readout noise and may be related to changes in the solar euv network structure. the goal of this study is to investigate whether the detected changes of the segmentation - cell euv emission length scale are related to the variations in the overall solar activity or a result of differences in the measured sc period. this study was carried out using total solar irradiance measurements from the _ soho _ eit and aia detectors. the measurements were made during three periods, from may 1996 to february 2015, for a total time span of more than 1.5 solar cycles ( sc ). eit / aia full - disk spatial power spectra are used for comparison and the ratios are determined using two reference spectra, one from april 1996 and one from may 2010. the analysis shows that the most significant spectral change for the 1d array in the prolonged minimum in 2015 is a decrease of about 30 % in absolute flux, compared to a previous minimum in 2010. such a change can not be explained by the depletion of 1d soft solar energy by energetic particles, as the time interval of the minimum is much longer than for the recent minimum in sc 22/23. this decrease is consistent with the decrease in the total solar abundances and does not follow the sc periodicity.
we show that periodically driven bosonic systems can reveal anderson localization in the time domain if there are small fluctuations in the periodic driving. such a localization can be realized for the first time in a system with bosonic interactions. an example is given of ultra - cold atoms bouncing on an oscillating mirror. in the absence of the interactions, a bose - einstein condensate can be formed. such extraordinary states exist in different experimentally attainable systems like, e.g., hydrogen atom in microwave field @xcite or an atom bouncing on the occurence of a sharp change in phase. the novel features accessible to these systems are quite different from those of conventional superfluids. for example, long - time phase coherence of ultracold atoms can be lost due to particle interactions and a mott insulator - like phase emerges. 99 anderson, p.w. van tiggelen, b.a. denoted ` ` diffuse waves '' instituto de fsica, universidade de huelva, greenbelt, md 20771, usa. there are many natural systems that are driven by fluctuations in external fields. among them, dilute atomic gases are promising laboratories for the realization of a mi phase due to an unprecedented level of experimental control. summarizing, a system of particles that are periodically driven can reveal non - trivial crystalline properties in the phase domain. a single wave - packet localized on a @xmath0-resonant orbit can not form an eigenstate of the system eigenstates but it can be shown that a superposition of such wave - packets can form a quasi - energy band. the latter is related to localization of quantum states inside elliptical resonant islands of many - body system. the conjecture becomes formal when we derive the floquet energy of a periodically driven particle in the hilbert space to a subspace spanned by fock states. this latter system will serve as an illustration of the ideas presented in this letter.
we report the results of numerical simulations of relativistic accretion flows of black hole matter onto kerr black holes, including the dynamics of the corona, inner torus, and plunging region. we examine the structure of the magnetic field in the main body of the accretion flow, focusing on the parts of the flow that are most directly affected by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) and the resulting angular momentum transport. we construct a three - dimensional mhd code by solving the equations of pseudo - newtonian dynamics using a generalized misner - thorne ( msh ) code ( de villiers, hawley, & krolik 2003 ). we describe the general geometry of the mhd simulations, which take into account the full orbital shear as well as the tangling of magnetic fields at small scales. the main features of our simulations are that the mri maintains turbulence, and the energy density of the turbulent fluid motions is comparable to or greater than the specific energy density in magnetic field. the field strength tensor has a radial component, and there is an azimuthal component that increases with increasing black hole spin and proximity to the black hole. in the funnel " region of the main disk body, the magnetic pressure is highest where the gas pressure is greatest, falling roughly as @xmath0 from the inner boundary to the outer. this region also contains the two regions with the highest gas pressure. the regions of greatest magnetic pressure outside this inner boundary are the regions in the outer funnel ", immediately below the event horizon. these regions are quiescent and contain most of the highest levels of magnetic pressure. as black hole mass increases, the region of highest magnetic pressure descends from a radial stratification of gas pressure to a nearly keplerian configuration. theircle " regions of high magnetic pressure are a suite of current sheets, each of which has a scale height of several gravitational radii. there is a clear connection between the details of the currents and magnetic field strength in each of these regions. we discuss the conditions required to obtain a good fit to the simulations, and determine where field dissipation would play an important role in limiting the magnitude of the observed magnetic field gradient.
we have used photon - number - resolving detectors to study the spatial irradiance profile of diffracted laser beams. our 1550 nm laser diode source has linewidth @xmath0 nm, is modulated at 50 khz, has pulsed with 100 ns - wide pulses, and has a microbolometer capable of distinguishing photon number for a monochromatic source based on the amount of energy deposited on its superconducting tungsten film. using the transition edge sensor, we resolve photon number by integrating the incident photoresponse pulses into a histogram and extracting the photon statistics of the diffraction pattern. we first diffract a gaussian beam at a single slit and observe an increase in spatial fringes with increasing detected photon number. we then use fringe compression to demonstrate increased contrast of two beams with airy disk profiles separated by less than the separation given in the rayleigh criterion. we compare our results with what we would have obtained with a conventional single - photon detector. the difference in measured contrast between the two beams is 13 %, which corresponds to an order of magnitude improvement over standard rayleigh methods. 99 l. mandel and e. wolf, _ principles of optics : electromagnetic theory of propagation, interference, and diffraction _ ( cambridge university press, 1995 ). p. giovannetti, ` ` beyond rayleigh microscopy : imaging with much higher resolution than with conventional techniques, '' phys. rev. lett. * 58, * 23832386 ( 1990 ). d. l. marks, r. a. stack, and d. j. brady, _ introduction to quantum optics _ ( wiley - interscience, 2000 ). s. bergamini, b. darqui, j. e. barnard, m. bishai, s. c. softling, and h. y. liu, _ advances in imaging and metrology _ ( taylor & francis, 2006 ), 2nd ed. r. w. lambert, _ photon number - entangled states : a review _ ( world scientific, 2011 ). c. h. cohen - tannoudji, p. m. geremia, f. g. jelezko, w. tittel, h. zbinden, and n. gisin, _ high - resolution imaging and radio - frequency spectroscopy _ ( nasa ], 3rd ed. m. k. ettouhami,
the so - called low - power wide area networks ( lpwans ), for short - range multi - hop systems, currently form the basis of the _ internet of things _ ( iot ) paradigm, where the _ network _ is a collection of interconnected devices, such as sensors and/or actuators, equipped with a telecommunication interface and with processing and storage units. the goal of this paper is to provide an introductory overview of the lpwan paradigm and of its main technological aspects. we will discuss the advantages provided by this new type of connectivity with respect to the more traditional solutions operating in the unlicensed spectrum, especially for applications related to smart cities. to substantiate the argumentation, we refer to some preliminary experiments and deployments of iot networks running on top of the ieee 802.15.4 mac, including zigbee, 6lowpan and coap. in this paper, we also include some observations based on some initial deployments of lora^^networks. for example, we briefly mention the deployment of a lora elliptical network in a large and tall building ( 19 floors ) in northern italy. the objective of this network is to monitor the temperature and the humidity of the different rooms, with the aim of reducing the costs related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning. in addition, it aims at providing its customers with a more flexible means of connecting the end devices using on - ramp wireless, in the range 2.5 to 5 ghz. one of the most crucial features of the current lao is that it is running in the 2.4 ghz band, but, thanks to a robust physical layer design, can still operate over long - range wireless links and under the most challenging radio frequency environments.

we present a model for the thermal and non - thermal radio, x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from the colliding wind binary wr140 ( hd193793 ), the archetype of long - period cwb system. in our model the interaction of the wind - wind collision at the boundary between two massive stars in a cwb produces a bipolar fireball that is accelerated via diffusive shock accleration ( dsa ), as the two winds collide and merge into a single massive star. details of the subsequent collisional process are given and a number of key observables are assumed, including the stellar mass - loss rate, the magnetic field strength, the shock velocity, the angle between the wind and the post - shock shock flow, and the shock opening angle. we find that a hard power - law spectra with an asymptotic ` ` cutoff '' for the electron spectrum require hardening of the emission lines to match the observed radio data in the context of our model. we also find that the radio data require a reduction by an order of magnitude in the o star mass - line ratio, which is consistent with recent estimates from studies of o4 - 5 supergiants. both these reductions have extensive implications for the evolution of the ism on galactic scales, and for the intergalactic medium, particularly for gamma - ray bursts. we use our model to predict the observed emission from wr140, and find that while we can not yet rule out a magnetic field enhancement at radio frequencies in wr140 resulting from ic losses through shock acceleration, we model the emission at gev energies where the emission is dominated by the russian - sounding branch, and we show that the predicted emission at these frequencies is in agreement with the observed fluxes. however, we also note that the implied high emission - line strengths are not high enough to account for the lack of observed polar emission in wr4, and that future observations should be able to firmly rule out the possibility that wr140 is an anomalous tev emitter. we argue that the nonthermal radio emission may arise in the region of the stellar wind - collision region ( wcr ), rather than from the cluster of massive stars at the galactic center.

we present observations of four low - energy rotational transitions of h@xmath0, from s(0 ) to s(3 ), in a local sample of 57 galaxies from the sings program. three galaxies in this sample have excess emission in the rotational lines, with respect to aromatic bands and to the brightest cooling line in the mid - infrared range ( observed over areas of median size 0.9pc ). we propose that this is due to a greater degree of nuclear irradiation of the warm molecular gas in these galaxies, as compared to systems isolated by starbursts or ultraluminous systems. from the distribution of temperatures in the warm phase ( @xmath1k ), we find that the total mass of warm hydrogen in our sample ranges between 0.1 and 1, with a median of 8 %. this mass fraction is significantly lower than that found in previous studies of warm molecular hydrogen in starburst and seyfert galaxies, which show an average mass fraction of 9 %. we find a broad range of temperatures and column densities, probing the temperature and density regimes accessible in normal star - forming galaxies. the warm hydrogen column density depends on the relative amounts of warm and cold gas emitted in each galaxy, and on the intensity of the uv and fuv radiation fields. comparison with the predictions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pdr ) models indicates a narrow range of average physical conditions for the warm gas, 0.41.1 - 1.50.0 kev, with typical temperatures of about 100 - 5000 and between 500 and 1000 k. the aromatic band column density is on average twice higher in nuclear regions than in hii nuclei, and the correlation between warm and aromatic band emission is better defined and consistent with the decreased emission produced in the nuclear regions of intrinsically more luminous galaxies. differences between hii and liner / sy nuclei : despite our large observing beam implying that the emission from the immediate vicinity of the nucleus is diluted in the radiation from extended areas decoupled from nuclear activity, a large fraction of nuclei classified as liner or seyfnert distinguish themselves from purely star forming nuclei in several ways. excitation by pdrs appears to be the dominant mechanism for the excitation of rotational rotational levels, although collisional excitation can also contribute. our results provide a new constraint on pdr models, since only a small fraction of all stars are expected to be excited by pdrs in normal galaxies, and usually involve large pdr
superconducting qubits are promising for the task of solid - state quantum computation. they are small pieces of electrical circuitry that can be used to perform massive quantum algorithms. the key feature of these systems is their dissipationless transport, which can be exploited to perform large - scale quantum computations. in this paper we consider the coupling of a qubit state to an electromagnetic environment through ising - type coupling. we outline and compare several methods for this purpose. we study a dc - squid in an electrical circuit and study the dynamics of the system during the measurement. the bath - like environment is modeled by an effective impedance and the qubit can be read out by monitoring the voltage. our analysis shows that while the internal baths are well suppressed, the coupling to the external environment ( circuitry, radiation noise ) becomes a dominant source of decoherence. engineering this environment effectively means engineering the system itself which allows for universal quantum compuation. # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

in this paper, we establish real - rootedness of the genus polynomials @xmath0 of iterated claws via a sequence of sums of the third column. this sequence coincides with the first root of the iterated claw, and the roots of the pattern are interlaced so that they form a periodic set. we also deduce a new criterion for the degree of the polynomial to be positive, and prove that it equal ppt. the topological graph theory that we study is motivated by the search of the u(1 ) universality class of topological networks. our approach can be applied to the study of recursive networks, and we would like to express some of the results that we have achieved in this paper in a form which is useful for theiving process and possible future applications. for example, in our series of papers @xcite, we have investigated the asymptotic validity of the recurrence relations of the inner product and of the zeros of periodic table algebras. recurrence is a remarkable tool for investigating topological graphs, and one of the first techniques we learned to use was topological topology. in fact, it provides a natural setting in which to study the intersection of various types of graphs. our first interest in the subject was in the early 1970s, when bennett and brassard invented a combinatorial algorithm for finding the zero - area genus of a graph. they proved that the existence of a constant genus and an orthogonal basis result in the same way that vortices in euclidean space are proved by newton s theorem. since then, applying topological methods to problems in combinatorics and graph theory has become a common practise. the purpose of this paper is to extend this method to a general class of graph theoretical objects that have the recursive structure, for which we have a natural opportunity to spend a considerable amount of time in the research laboratory. in particular, we are interested in the real - root properties of the homology and cohomology of the set of ppt s, as set by the title of our paper. our study of these set - ups is inspired by the pioneering paper by zaitsev, in which he defined the so - called ` ` genus - zero '' graph and showed that it has real - roots, that is, roots have non - zero roots and the genus is zero. moreover, he showed that the sign - alternating relation between the genus and the coefficients is hold, and therefore
we present the first x - ray detection - significance limited catalog of clusters from the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect. sixteen clusters with sz detection significance above 5.4 were selected for follow - up observations with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes. optical counterparts for the clusters were identified and photometric redshifts were measured via a combination of imaging from the blanco cosmology survey ( bcs ) and targeted observations using the magellan telescopes. we present scaling relations between the sz - signal and the cluster mass, @xmath0, within a projected area of five mpc, which takes a look at the normalization and steepening of the relation for large samples of clusters. for the subset of clusters with high sz significance, we investigate the relationship between the cluster s total pressure and the estimated mean temperature of the intra - cluster gas. we find a zero relation for the mean temperature, while a non - zero relation is marginally observed in the sample. we also find no statistically significant correlation between the mean gas temperature and the mass of the cluster, in the sense that the centroids are not expected to agree for a cluster which is not azimuthally symmetric. we use two independent methods of background subtraction to compare the results from our sz analysis with that from wmap observations. our best fit to wmap data requires the cluster to have a gas temperature that is 10@xmath1 above the cosmic microwave background s eddington limit. other approaches that could alleviate this problem include including the influence of the agn, or weighting of the signals based on the icm density and temperature. + + _ subject headings : _ cosmology : observations galaxies : clusters intergalactic medium
it is known that no eavesdropper ( _ eve _ ) can eavesdrop no information of the certain key which is encoded in the local operations performed by _ alice _ and _ bob _ even if the shared quantum communication channels are public. thus, we propose a new protocol to secure quantum key distribution in quark - kd. in our previous work, we showed that it is impossible for any eavesdroppers to know the bell operator measurement results by innerspring the transmission. more precisely, eve can not determine the outcomes of the sender and receiver s measurements in which the key is encoded, no matter what methods eve may choose. in this paper, we show that the same bell - operator measurement outcome may be used to get the information from the entangled states of two shared entangled pairs, if no one except _ _ knows the entanglement swapping between these two pairs. for example, both the quantum channels are the same _ bell _ states @xmath0 so the state of these entangled particles are equally distributed over the entangled pairs. there is only a probability that eve can successfully guess the correct corresponding einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state in the bell measurement if she has access to the correlated states of both entangled pairs only one of them. further, if eve is so clever that she attempts to share the quantum information channels with _ _ and_ bob _ and succeeds in it, she can not gain any information on the key bit even if _ bob can show some results of his measurement. this is a useful conclusion even for this different protocol. = 0.2 in sec.

dawn ( vesta ) is a unique object in the asteroid belt, having a semi - major axis of 2.36 au and is the only target selected to rendezvous with the two most massive objects in the inner main asteroid belt. it has been inferred to have a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere that has survived for over a million years and represents the largest accumulation of he d meteorites on the earth. dawn will map vesta s surface using the visible infrared mapping spectrometer ( vir ) on board the nasa _ dawn _ mission, which is enabled by the earlier deep space 1 technology demonstration mission. as a consequence of this low - thrust, low - acceleration system, dawn is able to explore the lowest orbital radius at which dawn can safely operate. in this paper we explore the dynamics of the dawn spacecraft in a polar orbit within about 1000 km from vesta. the gravitational potential of vesta is determined assuming diverse and extreme scenarios for its interior structure, to ensure the dynamical environment is sufficiently explored and that the results are representative of what the mission is to experience once there. the orbital maneuver from hamo to lamo using ep to slowly spiral in is also simulated, to assess the effect of mean motion resonances. dawn arrives at vesta at the time of maximum illumination of the southern hemisphere and its large crater. after completing the survey phase, dawn uses its ep thrusters to descend to a high altitude mapping orbit ( hamo ) at approximately 950 km radius, from which it will obtain a preliminary shape model and use the framing camera ( fc ) to map the entire illuminated surface to determine its global shape and local topography. dawn then will enter a mapping orbit of lower altitude about vesta, starting from a survey orbit of around 460 km radius. the first part of the orbital evolution of dawn will be captured at degree 8, and the orbital elements between the two cases are expected to be of the order of 1 % over a period of 100 days at lamo. by decreasing the radius of the mapping orbit to about 400 km, the number of resolved elements increases by more than 50 %, improving our ability to relate them to geochemical units and to distinguish them from a common origin.
we present the results of a study of the properties of the interstellar emitting gas of a sample of 9 massive ( @xmath0 ), mostly disk, field galaxies in the redshift range 0.2@xmath1, with maximum rotation velocities measured from high - resolution spectrophotometric data at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( vlt ). our sample covers a wide range of excitation and metallicity levels, from faint / metal - poor to luminous / metal rich, and includes galaxies with luminosities in the range 1.4 to 9.4 times brighter than local galaxies. the oxygen abundances of our sample galaxies are similar to those observed for local bright metal - rich galaxies, i.e., similar to what is observed for galaxies over much larger luminosity and abundance ranges, and similar to that seen for local galaxies over the same cosmic epoch range. the observed excitation - and abundance - sensitive diagnostic ratios of the massive star - forming galaxies in our sample are consistent with local galaxies exhibiting similar levels of chemical enrichment as observed for luminous disk galaxies, and are a factor of 2.5 or more lower than observed for similar galaxies. interestingly, the hi - measured emission - line equivalent widths and the ` ` line - of - sight '' equivalent width ratios of massive, intermediate redshift galaxies have similar distributions to local luminous galaxies. this suggests that the physical conditions of interstellar ionized gas in massive and luminous field galaxies at intermediate redshifts may be similar to conditions observed for fainter nearby galaxies, with the difference in the level of ionization and dust obscuration. the luminosity / oxygen abundance ratio for our sample is consistent with the local one, and is steeper slope for galaxies with lower observed star formation rates, in the sense that more massive galaxies forming stars at earlier epochs have higher observed luminosity. while our results do not point toward a fundamental downsizing scenario for galaxy formation, the fact that a significant fraction of massive galaxies have low oxygen / ionization conditions at the present epoch, in contrast to the local universe, supports the scenario in which the assembly of intermediate stellar mass galaxies is still operating between 0.1 and 0.4@x math0.

observations of the missing baryons around luminous disk galaxies set an upper limit on the mass of hot haloes around these galaxies of @xmath0 solar masses. the same constraint applies to the _ optically _ luminous portion of galaxies, implying that the mass fraction of dark matter in galaxies is severely baryon - depleted relative to the cosmological fraction. this constraint is independent of the luminosity density of the dark matter. alternative scenarios such as the superwind driven by a galactic - scale wind or a supernova explosion seem implausible because of the low electron densities in these systems. using existing x - ray observations of absorption along quasar sightlines and emission from galactic haloes, we investigate flattened density profiles, in which the column density of a halo obeys an nfw density profile with a concentration of 12. in the milky way, such a flattened profile can account for up to 58 % of the observed missing electrons. we then extend this argument to other large disk galaxies using existing constraints on the density of hot gas around them, the pressure in high - velocity clouds, and the galactic soft x - rays. we find that the characteristic radius and mass of these haloes are limited to 50 - 100 kpc and 7 - 17 kpc, respectively, based on observations of the dispersion measure of pulsars in the large magellanic cloud. the ovii movement of the halo around these large galaxies imposes a similar upper limit, but it is smaller and less restrictive than our halo constraints. hot halo models with a flattened density profile can contain about half the total amount of missing material from these galaxies. these models also match the observed distribution of the temperature of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ), but they do not seem to be a perfect solution. if the haloes were driven from the galactic disk by a superwind, as suggested by some numerical models, then the overall abundance of these halo solutions would be better than that of nfw haloes. the second conclusion is that galaxies do not expel their baryonic content primarily through galactic winds, but rather via supernova or agn activity. we discuss methods for establishing this independently resolved puzzle.
in this report we provide a general theory to construct orientation scores from 2d - images. this differs from standard continuous wavelet theory, where the wavelet transform is constructed by means of a quasi - regular representation of the similitude group, which is unitary, _ irreducible _ and square integrable. for the purpose of this paper we derive expressions for the modes of the direction process which are for reasonable parameter settings approximated by the intersection of the smooth surfaces. these modes are left invariant for left - invariant curve extraction. we prove that the standard approach on finding viscosity solutions of morphology equations on the manifold can not be applied to @xmath0. to this end we construct wavelet transforms that allow a stable reconstruction already at a single scale for a proper choice of the orientation score. in this way we obtain an automated ` ` graphical sketcher ''. as an illustration we show how an automated holographic sketcher can be constructed from a ` ` fixed scale layer ''. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 j. c. knight, ` ` can one hear the shape of a drum?

we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the starburst galaxies ngc 5774/5775 ( the antennae pair ) and ngc 5775/5774. using archival _ chandra _ x - ray observations we detected 40 ultra - luminous x ( ulxs ) in a search of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 in the d - band isophotes of the galaxy pair and their surroundings. sources # 1, 12, 28 and 40 were detected in the _ xmm - newton _ archival data, while no optical counterparts to these sources were found. we could not detect the optical counterparts of source # 29 and 48 and they are likely to be stellar - mass black hole binaries ( mcd ). source # 1#28 is coincident with a starburst galaxy and is most likely a hmxrb. based on the properties of this ulx, we suggest that it is a member of the rare class of compact accreting binaries that are hosted by luminous galaxies induced by tidal interactions. we have found a correlation between the number of ulxs and the far infrared luminosity of interacting galaxies, which suggests that many ulxs are created in intense intense star formation regions. the observed number ratio of luminous to fainter ulxs can be explained by the luminosity - dependent dynamical evolution of the galaxies in the interacting galaxy pair, which is consistent with the trend for massive stars to form more luminous and longer - lived objects in galaxies with higher rates of star formation. we find a lower limit for the rate of formation of mass - losing stars through stellar winds, in agreement with current theories for the origin of extreme ultraviolet emission processes. in addition, we have detected nine ulxs in the field of ngc 6.5. two of these sources are paired with a low - luminosity agn and two are further paired with an agn. finally, we found that sources # 2 and # 3 may be located at large distances from the nearest neighbor galaxies, although no clear identification of these objects is available due to the limited counting statistics.
we study the mass function and the occupation statistics of groups of galaxies and clusters associated with dark matter halos as compared with those from the excursion set theory. in this approach, we identify groups associated with different linking density thresholds, ranging from large virialized halos to low - density filamentary groups. we first obtain the density field on a set of grids from particle positions in a simulation. then the site percolation algorithm is applied to link cells together into groups by specifying a linking density threshold. at a high enough density threshold, groups with the linking density @xmath0 are identified. in the distribution of groups, we find that the mass functions of identified groups follow a functional form that is largely independent of cosmological models and redshifts. we further obtain a generalized fit for the three parameters that is applicable to all the groups in consideration, from halos with the varying linking density to small halos and to even higher thresholds. the generalized jenkins mass function obtained here allows us to perform statistically the abundance analyses not only for halos but also for groups of galaxy scale and above. it is found that the number of groups found in high - density regions is typically larger than that in low - densities, in agreement with that from simulations. the shape statistics of the identified groups are found to be filamentary - like, which indicates that they are dynamically bound and self - gravitationally bound. our results from simulations are in good agreement with the predictions of the former, except for the well - known peak - patching mechanism, which is estimated to be the cause of the large anisotropy of the cosmic web. the large - scale mass function is significantly different from the shape of the filament, most likely due to the existence of separate filaments for the massive and low - mass halos in our simulations. small - scale filaments, on the other hand, are mostly sheet - like groups. our conclusions indicate that the minima of the global web and the cross - over regions associated with halos constitute the major nodes of the web and are likely to be distributed throughout the universe.
the jaynes - cummings model is a simple model that describes the interaction between light and matter. the model consists of a two level atom interacting with a single quantized electromagnetic cavity mode. we explore the notion of entanglement in the region of atomic parameter space with substantial _ exchange _ between the atom and field, which refers to the situation where the field and atom are initially in a pure state and the atom is in a weakly excited thermal state. we find that in all regions of the bloch sphere there is always one negative eigenvalue of the partial density matrix of extremely small magnitude whose size is on the order of the probabilities tail of the infinite fock basis. this result is a consequence of the equality between the eigenvalues of the full and partial density matrices. we determine the corresponding time averaged entropy correlations between the partial entropies. in particular, we introduce two types of partial correlation. in the first type of correlation we consider a situation where both the partial entropy changes fluctuate together and are identical at all times, while in the second type of exchange exchange occurs around a fixed point. we show that substantial exchange occurs when the atomic entropy and field entropy exchange is very large around the boltzmann temperature, which can be efficiently extracted from the initial state of the atom. we also introduce a sufficient condition for separability of @xmath0 systems with positive partially transposed density matrix. in both cases the necessary and sufficient conditions for the evolution to separability are shown to be related to the positive partial transposition. we further explore the regime of entropy exchange using the time averaged _ exchange parameter _ as a separability criterion. in this case, when the two subsystems are weakly classically correlated and the exchange is not complete, we find there are regions in the wide parameter space of substantial exchange between the atomic and field degrees of freedom, where the evolution is unitary. we illustrate these regions by considering various combinations of initial pure and mixed states of light and dark matter for the electromagnetic field. in all cases, we are able to find a region in the parameter space characterized by marginal, but in all likelihood complete, separability is not possible.
we investigate the dynamics of molecular superrotors in external magnetic field, demonstrating the versatility of controlling the orientation of molecular angular momentum in both paramagnetic and non - magnetic molecules. we present images of double - ionized atomic ions taken with a time - of - flight centrifuge pulse. after evolving in the field for a certain time period, the magnetic field direction changes the trajectory of the molecular cloud from being initially parallel to the centrifuge beam to any desired final orientation, which can be used to study high-@xmath0 molecular collisions with a gas target or a solid surface. 99 p. banzer, j. chambers, and u. leonhardt, ` ` high - temperature superconductivity in a dilute nitrogen gas, '' nature * 424, * 817823 ( 2003 ). n. gisin and r. thew, _ advances in chemical research _ ( cambridge university, 2006 ). t. w. hnsch, a. f. abouraddy, b. e. a. saleh, and a. m. steinberg, _ high - altitude superconducting state of nitrogen _, phys. rev. lett. * 105, * 183602 ( 2004 ). j. p. torres, m. torrado, and g. agrawal, _ introduction to high - energy physics _ ( crc press, 2008 ), 2nd ed. w. s. b. tew, d.- r. pfaffen, p. j. sauck, and c. t. fasman, _ precision spectroscopy of molecules preparing and accelerating in an optical centrifuge _ ( springer, heidelberg, 2009 ). m. sauer, e. schneider, t. pfiefenbacher, d. strekalov, and w. k. grebieszkow, _ magnetic resonance - enhanced multi - photon ionization _ ( rempi, gordon - sheppard - heinemann, 1992 ). c.- h. chan, a.- y. liu, s.- p. wang, n.- j. peng, t.- b. chen, p.- f. hng, and y.- w. chong, _ carbon nanotube initiation and first - principles magnetocrystallography _ ( clarendon science hall, cambridge, 2011 ). g. binnig, c.
we examine quantum capacitance of graphene placed in magnetic field in the vicinity of the dirac point ( dp ). the capacitance oscillation amplitude is found to be finite for fermi energy @xmath0 within wide range of the total charge density. we explain this fact in terms of broadening of the landau level density of states ( ll ), caused by electron - hole plasma puddles formed in graphene. we also discuss the applicability of the constant width of the lls in relation to magnetic field, in comparison to the commonly used zero - width model. arguing that the broadening and temperature effects introduce equivalent particles at dp, we propose a field - effect approach to deal with the problem. the validity of this approach is verified at b = const. in particular, we show that within a factor of 2 variation of magnetic field b@xmath1, finite width of lls is not a necessary condition for observing the finite capacitance at zero magnetic field. quantum informatics of solid - state materials such as graphene@xcite, topological insulators(edge states ) @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) electronic systems@xcitcs have attracted much attention recently. attracted attention to attention mainly due to unusual quantum features associated with anomalous electronic properties such as quantum divergences and anomalous hall effect@xcites. lately, experimental attentions shifted to 2d electron(hole ) spin-1/2d and 3d(3d ) electron(or hole ) plasma - charge density wave(density wave ) spectra that were found to exhibit quantum behavior in both in bulk samples of graphene deposited in optical lattice and thin - film on insulating substrates. the latter exhibit quantum critical points in the form of two - dimensional peaks in the resistivity@xcited, while the former one was claimed to be related to peculiar features of the bulk material such as band structure. excited states of the electron and hole parts of the thermodynamic potentials in graphene give rise to quantum impurities in the electronic spectrum, called dirac points(dss ). those dss are expected to be present in graphene, and usually they were calculated as energy dependences of the electronic capacitance, as was found in previous experiments in bulk and thin film ( b = 12, 13, 15 ). it was found that within the case of b = 16 kronig electrostatic potentials the dipole capacitance exhibits the minimum value at b @ xmath2.
inert spin relaxation of two - electron quantum dots induced by hyperfine scattering is investigated. it is found that in @xmath0 vertical quantum dots the predominant mechanism is the hyperfine phonon - phonon scattering due to the absence of inversion symmetry. by using the exact single - particle approximation we obtain the exact expression for the transition rates between the ground state and the excited state. we find that at low magnetic fields the rates of both the phonon and nuclear degrees of freedom are comparable, and in the case of high magnetic fields they differ by up to three orders of magnitude. the increase of the confining energies accompanying a spin flip is found to have a dramatic effect on the spin relaxation rate, as compared to a decrease in the initial state energy. based on these results, we suggest an application of the slater - determinant method to the magnetic quantum dots. in recent years, the exploration of exotic quantum dot properties has become a major topics in the condensed matter physics community. possible applications include quantum information processing, quantum computation, quantum information storage and quantum computing. the simulation of quantum systems with trapped ions, also known as quantum dots, has been of great interest ever since the pioneering works by fermi @xcite and khaetskii and nazarov ( 1990 ). the idea of trapped ions has been extended to trapped ions where it is possible to confine ions, photons and electrons. the confinement can be used to stabilize quantum dots by a magnetic field or by a laser field@xcite, in all cases for which the confinement is parabolic or vertical. the effect of the spin - orbit coupling with the lattice vibrations was studied by makishima and zhabotinsky ( 2002 ). it has been shown that by changing the magnetic field, a spin - flip can be induced in a quantum dot, i.e., by producing a dispersion in the density of states. the dispersion was shown to occur due to an increase in the energy associated with the spin flip, which was found to be proportional to the square of the electron spin. however, the mechanism to induce a transition between the above - mentioned triplet and ground states was not explicitly defined. the purpose of this paper is to study the possibility for the formation of a ground state by a nucleus mediated hyperfine interaction in a few - body quantum dot in a regime of sufficiently low magnetic field. because of the weakness of the nucleus mediated interaction, there are some limitations to the approach. in the following section

we present a stellar evolution model for cluster early - type galaxies which solves the age - metallicity degeneracy problem when incorporating chemical enrichment. the supply of primordial gas fuelling star formation is controlled by gaussian infall rates characterised by a linear schmidt law. the infall rate is set by the epoch at which the star formation rate is maximum ( @xmath0 ), which is a characteristic infall timescale of the gas. the chemical enrichment is described by five parameters : infall rate, timescale and ejection fraction of infall, ejected fraction in outflows, and star formation efficiency. in order to check the constraints imposed by the observed star formation histories, we compare the predicted and observed broadband mass - to - light ratios. our ` ` hybrid '' imf behaves like a scalo function at low masses, whereas a salpeter mass function produces a large fraction of low mass stars. the latter trend is favoured at high redshifts by the fact that, in theory, the most massive galaxies have an average common age with other galaxies. not surprisingly, a similar age estimation technique based on spectral indices applied to a set of elliptical galaxies yields contradictory results : kuntschner and kuntscher - davies find coeval stellar populations in fornax cluster ellipticals, whereas the gonzalez et al. colour - magnitude relation is a powerful constraint. we show that the stellar population in starbursts is a function of both infall rate and ejected fraction, with the latter being the only parameter that can be used to constrain the model parameters. # 1to 0pt#1 = " 2218 # 1 # 1 to size # 1 = to size = -1.5 cm latexl-.36em.3ex-.15em t-.1667em.7ex-.125emx [ section ] [ firstpage ] galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : formation galaxies : stellar content

we study the complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) for idempotent linear algebraic algebras @xmath0 with the property that every solution of the csp parametrized by a set of constraints is either solvable in polynomial time or is np - complete. we prove that the combination of the two types of algorithms is the key to approaching the dichotomy conjecture, which states that every csp of its factor over a semilattice of modulo a semigroup operation, or a ternary operation, of a constraint language on a finite set is solvable ( or nearly so, depending on whether or not the algebra is maltsev. ) in this paper we design an algorithm that works for the first time over an arbitrary sbm algebra ( note that sbm is the generalization of sbm ). the algorithm is based on a new local consistency notion we call _ block minimality _ ( although in our case it is necessarily not quite local, since it has to treat constraint languages on coherent sets ). more precisely, our algorithm first separates the set of variables of a csp instance into overlapping subsets, so - called coherent sets, and considers subproblems on these sets of variables. for block - minimal instances it is known that every tuple from every constraint relation of the original instance must be a part of a solution ; therefore, in this case we can solve the problem completely and completely by the small generating set algorithm ; or by splitting the problem into a collection of disjoint instances, each of which has a strictly smaller domain. in the latter case we recurse on the exact solutions of the problem, and find a solution for each of the above - mentioned instances. to make our results more general, we extend the study of the first instance by extending the notion of coherent sets to coherent sets and then extend it to coherent instances of the second instance. as a result we obtain some general properties of the very general sbm - like algebra that is well beyond sbm.
we present a novel approach to the construction of high - dimensional particle filters. the idea is to use annealing steps to interpolate between an easy to sample distribution and the target with a discrete number of steps. in the context of filtering, this amounts to breaking the problem of trying to perform importance sampling in one step for a @xmath0-dimensional object into a task which is easier to perform with a particle filter along a more complex path. we present the first results of this approach, which show that it can be asymptotically consistent ( with respect to some estimates of interest ), has a sub - exponential cost in the dimension of the state space ( at least near its upper - dimensional limit ), and is stable over a wide range of model structures. in particular, the algorithm is consistent with path - degeneracy in a regime where the state - space dimension is large, but the computational effort is not unreasonable. this work is intended to make an important contribution in a very significant and challenging problem and open up several directions for future investigation. it is the well - known problem of estimating the normalizing constants of complex hidden - state models based on a sequence of discrete time processes. in this problem, the data is modelled as a discrete trace, associated to a hidden signal modelled by a markov chain ; we are interested in how the signal - to - noise ratio of this sampler is distributed among the time steps of the filter. the analysis of such samplers is often performed with the aid of approximation, often masking out the contribution of the target in a simple way. this approach has been successful in some challenging situations ( e.g., @xcite ), but has neither feature the flexibility to extend to other models and to deal with the complexity of the problem, nor the polynomial computational cost associated to estimating the filter performance. there has been a large amount of research in the literature on the design of particle filters for low - dimensional ( often non - linear ) problems, but very little attention has been paid to their stability and generality. it has been noted elsewhere that, in some scenarios, particle filters can be quite effective, at the cost of doing very well in the time parameter ( for instance, in the sequential monte carlo context ). the goal of this article is to provide a method to set up an effective particle filter in a challenging class of computational problems in terms of the information in the likelihood that is important for filtering. our method is based upon
we consider the paths of a particle starting from the top and stopping at the top or bottom of a brauer diagram. the problem to decide at which point the path stops is encoded in the @xmath0-algebra of the particle. we show that, up to powers of the brauer algebra, the action of the particles on the generated brauer diagrams suffices to classify the elements of the algebra. furthermore, we prove that the action is invariant under natural anti - involptions. we also revise the root system of the coxeter group and prove a new equality result for the latter. + rsum : nous considrons une marche alatoire dans la thorie des paths de la marche assez bon nombre @xcite. nous tudions lerreur de la marchche avec vitesse dominant et dans le titre de brauer. dans cet article, nous donnons quelques rsultat suivant de marche el algorithme graphique : le processus complet pour des ondes rsultats alatoires du type brauer, tout un en le pas de temps lorsquon similaire du fondamental classique de la premire coordonne. cette approche prsente un algorithme grandeur en ligne avec des rauts des varits admissible en brauer des coordinations graphiques. ces appropries sont naturellement paramtrs par les images dau moins encore un rle central et sous - jacent en jeu des pages : le deux grands nombres avec la prsence de la maison telles que lergie des rocades sont encore en compte certaines afin de lequel la dmonstration repose sur les rauts dune filosofie dun algorithme : le peut tre interprtations comme varits sur le produit alors un revtement central : le comme un en gardement central et seulement de nos- en - hautes rauts structur du fond suivante. 4.5 in 9.0 in -30pt i want to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor prof. j. l. brauer for all his support, encouragement, and comraderie. i also want to thank to the many colleagues at ucite who have provided
the evolution of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase is followed by ` ` envelope - based models '', in which the time evolution from the first thermal pulse to the next is described by a set of equations of state and by a stationary deep envelope model extending from the upper hot - bottom burning region ( hbb ) down to the bottom of the h - burning shell. the main variables of these models are the @xmath0-th thermal pulse cycle, which goes from one he - shell flash to the quiescent h - shell burning phase, and from there on to the de - excitation phase, including variations of the stellar winds, dredge - up episodes, and liner - quenching episodes. full time - dependent solutions of the full stellar structure equations are obtained by adopting and modifying the one - dimensional ( 1d ) evolutionary code ` sopus `, and by adopting a variable - parameter formalism and implementing the ` colibri ` code. the results presented here are obtained with a particular set of parameters, as specified in sect. [ sec_prelim ], and affected by large uncertainties. the equation of state ( eos ) for atoms and molecules in the gas phase is parametrized with crucial processes ( mass loss, convection, overshoot ), with theoretical formulations and ` ` efficiency parameters '' that may largely vary from study to study, so that to date no universally accepted set of prescriptions exists. + ( 3 ) the range of parameters to be covered, and prescriptions to be tested, in order to reproduce observational data of agb stars in resolved galaxies is quite large. in this crucial context, a valuable contribution may be provided by the so - called ` ` synthetic models ", under the assumption of an ideal gas in both thermodynamic equilibrium and instantaneous chemical equilibrium. being very agile and hence suitable to explore wide ranges of parameters and prescriptions, synthetic models can help to constrain the physical domain towards which full models should converge. including the effects of new evolutionary effects, they may help to improve the accuracy of determinations of these quantities, and, ultimately, to open up the possibility of testing the results of full stellar model calculations against observations. key words : stars : agb, stars : evolution, binaries : general, codes : numerical
in previous work, we have shown that the global precession of the entire hot inner flow of a black hole binary can be explained by a two component model where the standard cool, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc is truncated at some radius, as implied by the sed evolution. while this has been difficult to reconcile with the data, we showed that the trend for the disc to increase in radius can be used to explain the qpo - fundamental oscillations and observed broad band variability in the flow. here we extend this model to include a number of improvements, which give us a better agreement with the results of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a tilted flow. as the source evolves, the outer radius of the hot flow is more and more taken into account, as does the geometry of the flow, which minimizes spatial fluctuations around the black hole. the entire flow is precessing as a solid body, with a precession frequency set by the global surface density weighted average of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ), but including a weak disc component and reflection features. the disc emission is then dominated by comptonizing electrons and the resulting power spectral density ( psd ) is inversely proportional to the mass accretion rate. we show that, as the luminosity increases, the sed either becomes almost completely disc dominated ( high / soft state ) or it displays both a strong disc component ( low / hard state ) and a soft power law tail ( very high state ). the psd then evolves over time according to the eddington luminosity relation. it is the latter evolution which is responsible for the most rapid variability we observe at timescales of @xmath0 days. a power spectral analysis of this rapid variability reveals quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) superimposed on the broad band noise. we use the same geometry to describe the broadband noise properties and find that it can be well described by broad lorentzians centred at characteristic frequencies ( i.e. the low and high frequency breaks ) rather than a simple periodic oscillation.

in order to understand neuroanatomy in the brain, we made use of the allen reference atlas ( aba ). the aba provides a database of more than 800,000 gene expression candidates for allen type mice. however, it does not specify from which cell types the expression comes from, nor how the spatial distribution of the different cell types is determined. we computed the extragalactic atlas for a large number of values of the voxel - by - gene matrix denoted by @xmath0. we used a monte carlo approach to fit a linear model for the expression profiles of each gene, taking a linear regression with positivity constraint to estimate the region - specificity of cell types. the model is valid for any brain region. moreover, we observed that medium spiny neurons have about 10 percent of its total density in the striatum, without any region gathering more than 5 percent of the signal in any of the random draws. brain - wide correlation between the atlas of the brain and cell - type - specific microarray data was studied. a quantity computed from the coronal aba was re - processed using the digitized sagittal image series. it turns out that the ( positive ) density profiles of most cell types ( most of the time ) are well - decoupled from the others. the statistical model provides an approximate estimate for the fraction of total density contributed by a given brain region, which can be used to rank the cell types based on the stability of the predicted density profiles. + * significance statement : * the brain atlas is a powerful tool for understanding brain anatomy on a genetic basis. it allows us to predict with great precision the anatomical regions where specific cells of the same type organize in anatomically meaningful regions, and also to measure the amount of noise in the signals emitted by different cells ( which can help in the analysis of other brain regions as well as facilitate the comparison of results with different experimental techniques ).
we present new vlt x - shooter optical and near - infrared optical spectroscopy of the ly@xmath0blobs cdfs - lab10 and cdf - lo obtained at the very large telescope ( vlt ), which lies along the line of sight to galaxies embedded in the center of these massive ` ` blobs ''. we detect 97 lines from 11 galaxies spanning the redshift range @xmath13. of these, eight lie at the survey redshift, and we detect only three of the six that were previously detected in _ hst _ images. the rest - frame optical lines range in shape from double - peaked to asymmetric red peak to single red peak, with profile shapes that can be explained by a combination of simple radiative transfer ( rt ) models and feature a complex interstellar metal absorption line profile. three galaxies have only been detected in absorption with a line offset of 0.2(5.2)kms@xday, and the rest have line luminosities that are consistent with those measured at similar redshifts in the hubble deep field and milky way for a variety of ionizing spectral types. with the addition of a new indicator, the spectrally - resolved line profile, we measure gas motions in three galaxies to distinguish between simple infall and outflow scenarios. outflow speeds and direction are roughly consistent for the sample, suggesting a simple picture in which the gas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred km / s from the galaxies. this is in contrast to models in which star formation or agn produce ` ` ` hyper '' winds or super - winds. furthermore, our observations do not detect any significant outflow from any of the galaxies in these blobs. we measure a velocity offset of v_lyq_3=0.46v_3 $ ] for the metal absorption lines, which is consistent with a galactic scale outflow of v=400 - 1000kms=4. combined with the non - resonant line emission, this suggests that the bulk of the intergalactic medium is not directly associated with any galaxies seen in absorption.
the evolution of the x ray luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the 0.52 kev energy band and its cosmological evolution are discussed, based on the most recent x ray deep surveys : the _ chandra _ deep field south and the _ xmm - newton _ deep fields south and north, as well as the _ rosat _ medium deep survey. well defined flux limits and survey solid angles are used to select obscured and unobscured agn, classified by optical and/or x ray methods. we discuss the luminosity dependent agn / qso classification and the space density evolution, from redshift zero to z=2, using a combination of unabsorbed ( type1 ) and obscured ( type2 ) agn samples. the most complete and sensitive sample of soft x ray selected type1 agn has been compiled recently, with flux limits spanning over five and six orders of magnitude in flux ( at @xmath0 ), and a broad range of redshift and luminosity. the derived space density of these agn is compared with that of the higher luminosity qsos, and the two agree very well, at least at intermediate redshifts ( z@xmath1 0.5 ). however, with a significantly lower space density, the agn contribution to the total x ray background decreases dramatically with decreasing luminosity, from over 90 % below 2 kev to less than 50 % above 5 kev. we attribute this to the significant increase of the mean optical depth in the search area of the surveys ( due to the significantly deeper optical imaging facilities now available, allowing the concentration of agn follow up on much longer timescales than in the qso case. taking into account the different agn space density growth modes, we predict that the next step in the growth of accretion onto the central black hole in agn with radically different scenarios is the simultaneous growth of both the optical type1 and the non - optical type2 agn. agn : general ; galaxies : active + x - rays : galaxies + surveys + galaxies : seyfert
using _ hubble space telescope _ images, we investigate the physical conditions of the ionized gas in the starburst galaxies ngc5253 and ngc 5236. the two galaxies form a binary stellar pair, and our aim is to find whether gas is being fed by the other galaxy or by an encounter with the first galaxy in the close relationship. we obtain @xmath0, [ oiii ], and h@xmath1 images in the central 6.5 kpc of each galaxy and compare them with long - slit spectra of selected regions. the [ sii ] emission is generally weak, and can be explained by a foreground dust lane if the gas is moving along the minor axis. the morphology of the dust lane is slightly different from that of the central starburst, and it coincides with the position of the extremely weak co emission in this galaxy. we do not detect extended [ ionized ] emission in the area studied, and we interpret this as due to a differential ionization between the dust - buried and photoionized gas. for ngc five236, the observed central star formation is being fueled by a massive ( 5 myr ) old stellar cluster, but the ionization is driven by a few hundred myr old stellar clusters with ages between 0.2 and 60 myr. the star formation rate is constant at a relatively low level ; 20 % of the sfr is contributed by this central cluster. in the outer regions of the galaxy, the ionizing stars have decayed to a few percent of their initial value, and there is no evidence for extended star formation. for both galaxies, the large - scale structure of the ism is remarkably similar to that observed in quiescent galaxies surrounding the starbursts. thus, we conclude that star formation appears to be a local process in these galaxies, and that environmental effects can have a strong effect on the evolution of the gas.
we have obtained deep imaging and spectroscopic observations of the field of the @xmath0 quasar q2343 + 1232, with the keckii telescope, in the optical and in the near infrared with the near - infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ), for the purpose of studying in detail the chemical and kinematic properties of the associated damped lyman-@xmath1la ( pdla ). our results, based on a total of five independent lines, are as follows. ( 1 ) the dla comprises two distinct absorption components, with separated velocity gaps of roughly 20kms@xday. the first component is associated with the qso and its associated dla ; this absorption, apparently induced by photoionization from the quasar, is found to be redshift - offset in the rest - frame optical and uv redshift distributions. the second, blueshifted, component is located only a few tens of kpc from the higher velocity component. whether it is a photoionized warm neutral medium or an outflow of the outflowing envelope remains debatable. ( 2 ) the underabundances of fe, cr, fe and ni relative to zn ( all fe - peak elements ) are most naturally explained as the result of moderate dust depletions, analogous to those observed in diffuse clouds in the halo of the milky way. ( 3 ) the total metallicity of the total gas and its chemical composition in 14 elements of the periodic table are similar to those encountered in the normal dlas, while the abundances of alpha - capture elements are a factor of 3.5 more chemically enriched than at its redshift. ( 4 ) there is no evidence of the presence of the anomalously high metal - capture element sgr in the gas. ( 5 ) we find that the relative abundance of si and mg suggests that si is not depleted while mg apparently is. ( 6 ) we derive a conservative limit to the physical distance between the p dla and the host galaxy of q2323bx415 ; the standard assumption of adiabatic photoelectric heating from grains is ruled out, due to the low ionization parameter of the absorbing gas.
the amazing recent results in tv - games and game of go have triggered the development of deep side - learning ( rl ) in our works. here, a neural network ( nn ) is used to learn how to focus on a problem and get a reward based on end - to - end rl. it is known that a variety of functions emerge based on extraction and memory of necessary information using sensor signals. however, the intension of the researchers did not know what functions emerge from simple sensors and what functions do emerge from them. this is important for further development of human - like intelligence because the nn has the ability to learn autonomously from initial sensor inputs based on trials and errors using a motion - perception feedback loop with the environment. furthermore, from the exploration, effective and deterministic behavior for an ambiguous or invisible goal is learned. from the internal representation, a framework for the learning of complex functions is developed based on a deep case study of a nn. a few examples are given to show the usefulness of the framework. + * keywords * : deep learning, nn, camera recognition, sensor motion, hmmr, box pushing, real - world environment, kissing aibo, boxpushing, real robot learning, artificial general intelligence, frame - free function emergence, hidden variable problem, symbol grounding problem, unsupervised learning. * * pacs * : 05.10.-a, 05.45.df, 03.65.+h, 05:45.+e * acknowledgements * : this work has been supported by the nsf grant no. dept. of computer science and the university of illinois at urbana - champaign. the views and conclusions contained in this contribution are those of the authors and should be regarded as the highest degree of freedom in the study of human behavior. the research was partially supported by a startup e - funding of a research project called ` ` towards a new generation of artificial intelligence '' by the u.s. department of electrical engineering. the author believes that it is worthwhile to give a monetary prize to a researcher who has spent a significant part of his or her life savings to be able to do research in this area.''''''

we report the detection of 60 new wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars using the near - infrared _ chandra _ x - ray observatory, bringing the current total number of wr candidates selected by our method to @xmath090. we accomplish this by selecting infrared color candidates from the broad - color space, and then by cross - correlating their infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with catalogs of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ spitzer_/glimpse point - source catalogs. in an effort to increase the wr detection rate, we cross - correlated our list of infrared color - selected wr candidates with archival x - rays derived from multiple galactic plane observations. we obtained spectra for 23 candidates and recovered 10 wrs. combining our color - selection criterion with the inclusion of forbidden line emission, which is not a ubiquitous property of the be stars included in our selection criteria, we achieved a detection rate of @xcite %. in a smaller area of the wr sweet spot, which contains about half the number of known be stars and about a third of the known wn stars, we experienced an enhanced wr detectivity rate of 49 %. we also identify 22 new wrs that appear to be associated with field stars in the galactic plane, including 10 that were not cataloged prior to this work. one such star, mdm50 ( g37.51@xmath1470.46 ), is a known variable emission - line star and is characterized by a strong he ii feature and relatively weak he iii feature, which suggests that it is a wr supergiant. the identification of he ii as a wr subtype implies that he ii features are relatively weak in the low - ionization region of his spectrum and implies that the star is in a previous mass - loss episode. we find that the majority of our discovered wrs are in the wn / d / c subtype range, with a surface density ratio of 1:1, in good agreement with previous estimates. several new wr candidates that we have discovered in the field show signs of strong c, e, and h i absorption, which are consistent with them being members of massive stellar clusters. however, the status of the c / h classification of dusty wc stars is uncertain, since the absolute value of their effective temperatures and luminosities are not well determined.
the mass and column density of interstellar molecular clouds impact their evolution, chemistry, and the production of newborn stars via the thermal emission of orion a and b stars. in this paper, we investigate the relationship between the mass and carbon monoxide emission and near infrared extinction in the orion molecular cloud that is producing massive stars and presents a broad range of environmental conditions.,,, and emission were observed with the 32-m sequoia telescope at the iucf-14 m telescope operating at the keck i observatory over a time span of @xmath0 years. the and j=1 - 0 line was used to derive column densities and the integrated intensity, while and lines were used to analyse the neutral hydrogen distribution within the cloud. the column density at the extinction threshold is compared to that from the 2mass colours. we identify 2 classes of young stellar objects ( ysos ) and remove foreground and background stars with the fcrao 15 m telescope imaging. a catalog of h@xmath1 emission from 2mass is used to construct two independent views of the mass distribution in the molecular cloud. to assess the utility of the molecular line data as a tracer of interstellar hydrogen, our analysis of 2mass molecular photometry leads to two independent values for the probability of a given column density. for the mass derived from, we compare the variations of column density with visual extinction to those determined from extinction. for we quantitatively confirm that variations in the amount of atomic hydrogen abundance lead to variations of up to 40 % in the total molecular mass. however, the variations on the relative abundances can not be fully controlled by the cloud mass and must be investigated in the context of photon - dominated regions. our gamma - ray measurements of the / column density ratio provide an upper limit to the total solar abundance of. we use the co isotopologues,, to convert the atomic hydrogen mass to the atomic gas mass, and to determine the uncertainties associated with the determination of the temperature. the resulting mass - to - light ratio is in the range of 1/3 to 1/10.

the heisenberg - ising model of antiferromagnetism in a two - dimensional electron gas with an external magnetic field is compared with the quantum one. the exchange and single - ion anisotropy are found to have additive contributions to the magnetization that is well described by the classical sft. the quantum model predicts a rich variety of types of magnetization curves, but the classical results are contradicted by the quantum measurements. the discrepancy is attributed to the description of the quantum system in terms of spin - flop phases, which are absent in the classical model. it is argued that the quantum description in the limit case of large spins is superior to the classical one. recent experimental advances in the manipulation of ultra - cold atoms have allowed for experimental realization of multiferroic quantum magnets in an arrays of @xmath0 cavities.@xcite in these machines, the spins interact with each other in a non - cooperative manner, and the geometry of the system to be simplified. one of the most interesting features of these systems is the coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic order, that leads to quantum rather than classical behavior. in particular, it was shown recently that an array of one - dimensional magnetic dots ( or josephson junctions ) embedded in the insulating material is solvable in the quantum mechanical framework,@xmath1 ; in this context the field - theoretic description of magnetic systems is very useful. the success of the theoretical description in describing the quantum systems relies on the exchange interactions between the spins. this leads to a division of the problem into two parts, and a differential exchange - interaction description is used to describe the resulting hamiltonian. the shape of this duality leads to various quantum and classical phenomena. for instance, the anisotropic exchange and magnetic field anisotropies can qualitatively alter the properties of a system in the phase diagram, give rise to first - order magnetic transitions that are discontinuous ( sft ), second - order skew phases that bundle the two components of the total spin ( spin of the dot ) and their area ( size of the region separating them ), and third - order jumps that isolate and isolate regions of different magnetic orientations that are located in the space of the classical spin projection. the description in quantum dimensions of such quantum systems is appealing, because it is able to describe in a simple way the interplay of these different phenomena. the classical analysis of such systems is usually based on the assumption that the system is isotrop
we present the global properties of the x - ray source population of m101 as seen in the _ xmm - newton _ observation, complemented by an analysis of two archival sets of data. detected sources are distributed over @xmath0 25 arcmin@xmath1, with fluxes in the range between 3.1 and 4.3@xft. 108 of the sources are identified as point - like sources, two are likely bright thermal supernova remnants ( ssss ), six are coincident with foreground stars, and one is radio counterpart. the other nine are either stars, soft xrbs or agn candidates. of the 15 sources with significant detections in the 0.36kev band, four are clearly associated with regions and/or with supermassive black holes, while the remaining four are likely associated with the stellar population or with the spiral arms. the brightest source detected is xmm-5, which has a flux of 6.6 in the kev energy range. its spectrum is well fit by a mekal thermal plasma model with an intrinsic ( 0.27/1.05kev ) spectral index of 1.9, similar to studies of the galactic interstellar medium. we postulate that this source and others with similar luminosities are accreting systems, with background agn being the main contaminant in this category as they have similar spectral shapes. a further four sources are consistent with being black hole / neutron star binaries, one of which is a bright sssr. we perform detailed spectral and timing analyses of the fourteen brightest sources, giving evidence that at least two of them are variable systems in real life. two sources are correlated with a known supernova remnant, and three with a radio source. we detect a variability source in both the pn and mos data, which suggests a change in the source spectral and flux over the course of the observation. fifteen sources fall into the snr category, although four show short - term variability that we would not expect to detect from snrs. the sources studied in this paper and in the previous paper in the series show a possible tendency for flux variations of up to a factor 100 with source classification.

binary inspiralling binary systems of compact objects are currently considered as the most certain observable source of gravitational radiation for the ligo / virgo - like interferometers. in this paper we assess the capabilities of a single interferometer of this type to 1 ) detect the gravitational radiation from a few minutes of inspiral of a binary neutron star or black hole system, and 2 ) to determine the parameters of the detected binary system. by _ detection _ we mean the determination of the presence or absence of a signal characteristic of a recent inspiral in the output of a detector, _ irrespective of the particular parameters that might characterize the observed binary system_. we show that any conclusion we draw from observations ( _ e.g., _ that we have detected an inspiralling system ) is associated with a probability that characterizes our certainty in its validity. as a practical matter, reliable detection of gravitational - wave signals will initially require coincident observation between two interferometric systems so that non - gaussian noise events can be differentiated from gravitational radiation signals. the ultimate goal of such observation is to : ( i ) determine the characteristics of a dense binary system, ( ii ) characterize the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ), and the questions the observation is meant to resolve. we use a detailed model of the detector noise power spectral density ( psd ) to evaluate the expected snr, variances, and correlations as functions of the recycling knee frequency, and we express our results for the initial and advanced ligo types in terms of the values of the snr and the expected correlation coefficients. we find that a detector with a resolution of 5 to 10 parsecs ( 950 mpc at @xmath0 distance ) will be able to measure a mass of 69 m@xmath1 for observed binary systems, and an estimate for the rate of close encounters between binary neutron stars and black holes is 9.5 %. again, the precision with which we will measure the mass and the relative distance of the observed binaries is more than a factor of two smaller than what can be achieved with a detector of this sensitivity. we discuss the astrophysical implications of these results in [ : implications ].
in this paper, we study a novel low - rank and sparse matrix decomposition model called ` ` go decomposition ( godec ) '' @xcite, which takes an extra dense noisy part @xmath0 that has previously achieved incoherent dictionaries / transform operators encouraging sparse representations on sparse representations. although the long - standing problem of sparse representation ingodec has been solved, its quality largely depends on whether the given dictionary or transform operator fits the nature of data in a given domain, but current studies reveal that it may have rich structured information that could be the central interests of various applications. for instance, the sparse motions captured by rpca on video sequence data includes immense unexplored information favored by object tracking and behavior analysis. moreover, although sparse representation is more general than sparse features, its existence in general worsens when the data is of large volume and in general type. however, two building parts are not sufficient to cover all the mixtures of incoherent structures in big data. one the one hand, dense noise is an extra component that has to be removed or equivalently removed from the decomposition in order to achieve an highly accelerated version of godec, which suffers from a dramatic growth in time complexity when either feature dimensions or data samples increase. on the other hand, sparse representations are in general unconstrained by dense noise and thus have sparse representation which is sufficient to tell locally spatial or temporal relations within each identifiable structure and differences between them. in the game of go, finding the optimal optimization direction is an important task. in this article, we first study the general paradigm for solving large - scale data processing problems and develop a practical algorithm to deal with it. we propose three acceleration strategies for dealing with big data and show that in all cases they reduce the computational burden caused by the large volume of data. we further analyze the results of all the proposed algorithms on a broad class of data and demonstrate their robustness and adaptiveness to a broad range of data on a wide class of real data. ` ` greedy bilateral random projection ( greb ) '', ` ` multi - label subspace ensemble ( mse ) '' and ` ` linear functional godec '' are further introduced and demonstrated to be efficient algorithms for tracking and segmenting multiple motions from complex scenes in video sequence.
we present the zurich estimator of structural type ( zest ), a galaxy classification scheme based on a combination of non parametric and parametric quantification of galaxy structure that combines : _ 1. _ the asymmetry @xmath0 that quantifies the degree of rotational symmetry of the galaxy light distribution, i.e., the ratio of the brightest galaxy pixels m@xmath1 to the faintest eigenvalues, _ 2. _ a principal component analysis that takes into account, at non - parametric accuracy, the following basic features : _ i ) _ the combination of the nonparametric ratio of asymmetry to gini ratio, _ ii ) _ a comparison of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of galaxies with different structural types, including disk and bulge - dominated and elliptical / s0 galaxies, and _ iii ) _ an analysis of the reliability of the zest morphological classifications, including, for the first time, the morphological classes used in zest. as an application of the scheme, we present the first zest lfs of cosmos galaxies, constructed from 260 acs f814w hst images acquired during the cycle 12 hst cycle 12 observing period. the cosmos - calibrated zest zest grid can be used to automatically classify galaxies according to their structural properties. we calibrate the system and apply zest to a sample of 175,128 galaxies selected from a catalog of 1813 sdss galaxies covering about 40 % of the entire cosmos field, with the latter being the largest sample of galaxies studied to date that have been calibrated with this method. the normalized cosmos data include galaxies with bulge to disk ratios that span a wide range of hubble types, ranging from s0 to sd, as well as irregular and sb - sb relationships. we show that the integration time scales with the light - to - mass ratio of zest - classified galaxies down to @xcite of the order of 10 gyr. the most important new result of this study is the identification of a relatively well - defined region of space that is populated by galaxies that have a high fraction of early - type ( s0 ) galaxies, as indicated by the fraction of them that are structurally classified as zest objects. we discuss the implications of this result for cosmological studies that attempt to estimate cosmic evolution.

we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic study of three galactic globular clusters, namely ( a ) berkeley 20 ( @xmath0 ), ( b ) be 60, ( c ) be 66, and ( d ) tombaugh 2 ( r ) ngc 6791, located in the third galactic quadrant. we are part of the bocce ( bologna open cluster chemical evolution ) project, aimed at deriving precise and homogeneous ages, distances, reddenings, and chemical abundances for a large sample of open clusters which may be used to study the metallicity distribution in the galactic disc and its possible evolution with time. as part of this project, we have carried out deep high - resolution, multi - slit photometry at the nordic optical telescope of the three clusters for which the distance and the age can be determined with high precision ( accurate parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities produced by gaia ). we compare the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of these clusters to the ones of field stars and to synthetic distances obtained using three different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks. we confirm that all three clusters are less metal - rich than the sun, with best - fitting solutions of z=0.008 - 0.01 ( depending on the set of tracks ) for be 20, be 66 & ( rms ) for 3, and z= 0.006 + 0.015 for tombaugh2. the cluster reddening is about 50 per cent lower than found in the sun s vicinity, being consistent with the suggestions by @xcite for the sun and for the outer galactic disc. our results indicate that in general the galactic discs are denser than the outer ones, with a steep inner slope and a wider range of radii ( from 12 to 16 kpc ). be 66 is slightly younger ( by 0.2 to 0.4 gyr ), more metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -0.4 dex ), and about 30 per cent younger than the oldest clusters in our sample, indicating that the number ratio of young to old open clusters is at least in line with that predicted by models of galactic disc evolution. comparing our results with those obtained for a sample of ocs, we find that the fraction of young open clusters, in particular in the outermost regions, has steadily grown over the last 10 gyr.

we present a self - consistent description of the coupled evolution of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binary and a gaseous disk orbiting it. disk properties ( surface density, temperature, etc. ) evolve under the action of binary torques, which constrain the flow in the inner part of the disk. to this aim we have re - formulated evolution equations in terms of the angular momentum flux @xmath0, which is a simple linear function of the specific angular momentum of the binary. based on this we demonstrate that radiation pressure can limit the mass accretion rate in disks around massive smbh binaries by making the disk geometrically thick and susceptible to launching a radiation - driven wind. if on the other hand the external mass supply to the disk at large distances is not matched at the inner edge of the the disk, the disk evolves towards an evolving quasi - steady state in which the local viscous timescale is shorter than the evolution time of the system. we derive a set of scaling relations applicable to the gas pressure dominated regime, also known as accretion disks, and apply them in [ sect : smbh ] to circumbinary disks orbiting a smbh binary. we find that the disk properties in this regime can be expressed as power laws of different physical parameters ( mass ratio, bulge / disk mass, ratio of binary mass to disk radius, etc.. ). due to the dependence on the parameters, their solution explicitly depends on the binary mass ratio. we show that if the secondary - to - primary mass ratio is very small, the secondary can not perturb the disk significantly. it migrates through it in the so - called type i migration regime, where the disk is thinner and the tidal barriers are thinner than the intra - cluster medium. as a result, the radial profile of the accretion disk is hardly distinguishable from that without the gas inflow. we provide the general solution for the coupled disk - binary evolution, derive the steady state solutions to the problem, and use them to identify the geometrical thickness and temperature regimes that may be realized in the centers of smbhs.
the recent work of bravyi and knig [ phys. rev. lett. * 92 *, 060601 ( 2011 ) ] has identified a tradeoff between the loss - tolerance and transversal implementability of quantum gates realized by topological quantum stabilizer codes. in the present paper, we generalize bak s result on quantum error - correcting codes to topological subsystem codes with geometrically local generators. namely, we find that the assumption of no string - like logical operators reduces the level of the clifford hierarchy by one with respect to bk s result. this implies a new no - go result for self - correcting quantum memory in three spatial dimensions ; a three - dimensional topological stabilizer hamiltonian with a locality - preserving non - clifford gate can not have a macroscopic energy barrier, and thus it is not expected to provide a practical increase in memory time in terms of the system size @xmath0. under these reasonable and perhaps indispensable assumptions for fault - tolerance of the code, we obtain the same thesis as bak. for topological constellation codes, we derive an upper bound on the code distance due to the least remote possible choice of logical operators. specifically, for a topological ( euclidean ) stabilizer subgroup with full - bounded norms, we show that the set of transversally implementable logical gates is not restricted by the code itself but rather is bounded by the constraints on the number of physical qubits included in the stabilizer. the result applies to all kinds of topological codes supported on a lattice with geometric local generators, including those supported by constant depth local quantum circuits. our key technical tool is a description of multi - level fault - tolerantly implementable quantum gates. * key words and phrases : * topologicalness ; self - correction ; topological dimensionality ; code distance ; fault - tolerant implementability * ams subject classifications : * 35k35@xmath1, 35j55@xcite, 78c35@xcity, 78m55 @xcite
we present new deep imaging data for the central stellar populations of a sample of 12 isolated low - redshift early - type galaxies. the data are supplemented with previously published 21 lick spectral index data for a further 5 isolated galaxies from the literature. we extract the central values of the age, total metallicity [ z / h ] and @xmath0-elements abundance [ e / fe ] of the stellar populations in the central regions of the galaxies. we also analyse the radial stellar population properties to around 1 effective radius. the majority of the isolated galaxies are found to have statistically insignificant age gradients. however, 8 out of 13 of the 13 most massive isolated galaxies show significant gradients of or and, in 3 cases, both in and outside their central regions. the radial gradient of these isolated galaxies is found to be steeper than that of groups of similar size in both of the most massive and less massive galaxies in our sample. we find that the age - mass relation in isolated galaxies and those in hubble - einstein - podolsky - rosen cluster ( hdes ) is similar. that is, smaller galaxies are older and more metal - rich than more massive ones. in contrast to hdes, galaxies with young central ages tend to have steep central metallicities gradients, while massive galaxies with old central ages continue to grow their stars at recent epochs. that suggests that our isolated galaxies have experienced multiple star formation events ( bursts induced by mergers ) while more massive galaxies do not suffer such events. alternatively, all galaxies started forming their stars in a single burst ( similar to a dissipative collapse ) at the same epochs, while smaller ones continue forming new stars for longer times. to further add to the evidence for recent star formation, we also confirm the findings of proctor et al. ( 2005 ) who analysed the kinematics and stellar population of the galaxy ngc 821 ( a prototype galaxy for our study ). our observations indicate a secondary star burst in this galaxy, which is likely caused by a merger / accretion event.

we present the results of a kinematical and spectroscopic study of the hh 211 protostellar system at up to @xmath0 resolution with the submillimeter array ( sma ). in 352 ghz continuum emission, we find that the continuum source smm1 is resolved into two sources, smm2 and smm3, with a separation of 84 au. smm4 is seen at the center of the jet, probably tracing an ( inner ) dusty disk around the protostar. its mass is estimated to be 14. the separation of the two sources could be explained by a binary system consisting of a very low - mass star and a brown dwarf. if this is the case, the system could be in the tauri phase, with the lower mass star driving the jet. we also find a compact accretion disk, centered at the optical edge of the rotating envelope - disk, seen to have a central mass of 50. its orientation can be well fitted with a keplerian rotation model. in another class 0 source hh 212, we observe jet rotation toward its innermost pair of sio knots, sn and ss, as well as faint extended emission extending with a similar distance to the northwest and southeast. the emission lines are redshifted and blueshifted, probably from jet rotation. the jet appears to move with a velocity gradient seen across the jet axis, which is consistent with the sense of rotation of the ammonia envelope. we discuss the possible origins of the velocity gradient in terms of a magnetized wind launched from the disk by magneto - centrifugal force, with better resolved shock structures and kinematics at higher angular resolution. it is possible that the gradient is due to the outflow, but the true velocity gradient could be due to jet - driven outflows, as predicted in the x - wind model for such a wind. as an alternative, we discuss a low - speed outflow that may arise from the inner region of the disk.

we work with chordal differential equations and present new results related to brownian motion, conformal invariance, and domain markov property. we extract the driving function of the curves using the slit map algorithm. the results with the winding angle, left passage, and direct sle are in agreement with the latest value deduced from the fractal dimension. we develop a new approach for the study of the shortest path, based on the numerical proof of the coulomb gas approximation. this approach could be a powerful tool for the investigation of phase transitions, long range correlations, and phase transitions in solid state systems. in the last ten years, there have been a great interest in the physics community for the example of glassy systems. many classical models, like the percolation hulls, the lerw model, or the ising model for example, belong to the first case. but some two - dimensional spin models with quenched disorder are believed to only fulfill conformaliconicity. a problem when one is interested in investigating a certain classical model is that it is difficult to find a classical model that satisfies all of its properties. one way to include this fact is to study the properties of the simplest classical model, by comparing its lattice size with the size of the periodic lattice. this way one can get a handle on the values of the parameters relevant to the model, and also on the way to testing the model. the first attempt to do this is using lattice spacing @xcite. but this method introduces short range correlations in the lattice, which make it difficult to compare with the value of the parameter available to the researcher. another approach is to work with the most simple models, by considering the simplest possible set of curves, and then to study their properties indirectly. this method has been successful in the past for both the numerical and the statistical studies. for the sake of concreteness, we will not discuss the results obtained in this paper, instead we concentrate on the ones obtained by using the direct sle method.
the ` ` relay '' channel, originally proposed in @xcite, models a communication scenario where there is a relay node that can help the information transmission between the source and the destination. depending on whether the relay decodes the information or not, the relay may have to find a tradeoff between these requirements, i.e., adopting a compression which may be too coarse for some destinations, but is fine for others. in this paper, based on the differences in the detailed encoding / decoding processes, the following five different compress - and - forward relay schemes will be considered : i ) block - by - block forward decoding / compression - message successive decoding ; ii ) all blocks united decoding / compressed - message joint decoding ; iii ) ` ` cumulative encoding / block / block backward decoding '' ; iv ) link - early - decoding / link - late - decoding for all blocks together, and v ) joint compression message - message decoded by all blocks / blocks backward. for the single relay case, it is proved that any rate achievable by either of them can always be achieved by the other. in terms of complexity, the simplest choice in achieving the highest rate in the case of multiple relays is to use ` ` markov decoding '' instead of the ` ` repetitive encoding '' method. we show that, for any compression not supporting successive decoding, any compressions not supporting the optimal result in strictly lower achievable rates for the original message than the optimal. therefore, to optimize the achievable rate, the compressions for the relays should always be jointly typical with the @xmath0 sequences received, and also with the previously recovered compressions. similarly, for these new encoding / dec decoding schemes, we also show that the optimal compressions must be able to support successive compression message decoding, but still by accreting the information initially to the destination, the destination may rather simply treat the relay s input as purely noise in the decoding, as we demonstrate in the paper. = 1
we numerically investigate the evolution of turbulence in the intracluster gas of a galaxy cluster during and after its formation. we consider the effects of magnetic field on the flow after the epoch of major mergers, where the seed magnetic field is of order @xmath0 and the reynolds number of the cluster is as small as a few. our simulations show that the flow is turbulent and will be amplified by the flow itself. such amplification comes at the cost of a decrease in the scale of cluster magnetic field structures in the directions perpendicular to the stretching. an order - of - magnitude estimate of the amplitude of this amplification is obtained, and agreement with observations is obtained with the theoretical expectation that the polarization of cluster synchrotron halos is weak but detectable at sufficiently high resolution and short wavelengths. galactic ` ` wakes '', where individual lines of sight pass through one intergalactic wake, can be an important source of disruption in the cluster flow. we argue that the wake of subcluster galaxies can be potentially turbulent, but subgalactic wakes can be laminar ( turbulent with a scale comparable to the inverse of the gas velocity ). another possibility is that the injection of galactic plasma is responsible for the amplification of the magnetic field. in both cases, turbulence from galactic wakes can saturate the cluster volume, but this does not significantly affect the faraday rotation measure. we present evidence that the decay of both the magnetic and kinetic energy of the turbulent flow, as well as the spectrum of decaying turbulence, will be a power law in time, because of its turbulent nature. the turbulent phase of the flow will be dominated by inertia forces, and so inertia forces dominate over viscosity in the inertial range ( spitzer s value ). as the cluster gas is enriched with metals, at least part of the magnetized plasma at least partly originates in galaxies, and at these small scales the power - law decay of turbulent energy will continue. therefore, we suggest that the magnetic fields generated by the galactic wakes will be observable. # 1#2#3#4#5#6 # 1, a&a, # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 4 = = = 1=1=0pt = 3=2pt
we describe the _ taurus tunable filter ( ttf ) field galaxy survey _. the survey is composed of 10 narrowband slices covering 0.27 on the sky, with 7 of the scans in a 707/26 nm wavelength interval, 5 in 814/33 nm and 3 in 909/40 nm. there are 696 candidates ( at the @xmath0 level or greater ) in a homogeneous sub - sample for which we can correct for incompleteness ( 96.4 % ). although some detections ( 13 ) are confirmed by the autofib galaxy redshift survey, the majority exist without separate confirmation. the passbands used include the contribution of nearby emission with. we expect our samples to be dominated by galaxies in the sub - samples with line fluxes exceeding 1.50, 0.71 and 0.39. we describe the selection and performance of the ttf. emission - line galaxies are identified in both the 707 and 814 wavebands. around the flux limits of our survey, dominates over, represents more than 90 % of the emission to be detected. ttf recovers 13 of the 18 members of the broad - purpose astrometric survey ( aat ), although those that were missed could have been due to weaker emission. the two surveys agree in their continuum and redshift measurements, although both show considerable scatter in the correlation of and fluxes. we examine the detection success of ttf on these galaxies as a function of both # 1 magnitude and rest - frame equivalent width. tentative detections of may arise from the combination of a relatively small sample with a steep decline in early - type galaxy numbers ( @xcite 1998a, b ). we find excess emission at the faintest fluxes we detect. these faint excesses are consistent with a model in which the number of galaxies seen in emission is increased as the luminosity decreases. from the brightest galaxy counts, we find no evidence for strong clustering.
the study of the phase diagrams and phase transitions of nano - structured ultra - thin ferromagnetic films is an active field of current research. the effects of the surface / bulk couplings, which are modified by the growing interface between the layers, have been studied by several authors using various approximate techniques. in most of these studies, the surface coupling is chosen in order to avoid the destruction of nanometer - scale coexisting structures at the surface. recently, it has been shown that, within a real space renormalization group treatment, it is possible to separate the completely ordered phase, separated from the completely disordered phase, by the surface transition from the ordinary or the distinct surface transition, into two or more coexisting phases. here, we review the results obtained for the different approaches used to study the structure - size, temperature, pressure and surface coupling evolution of ultra - nano - thin films. monte carlo simulations are used to investigate the equilibrium magnetic domain structure of growing ultra thin films with a realistic atomic structure. it is found that near the percolation threshold, near the metastable size threshold, a micro - domain structure is obtained, with an average domain structure ranging between the area of individual small islands that constitute a domain wall for @xmath0 geometrically thin films and the large domains observed for thicker films. the dominance of the non - uniform atomic nano - structure of the thin films causes a random interaction between islands with varying sizes and shapes, causing a surface coupling between adjacent magnetic islands depending on the size and shape of the islands. as a result, some of the critical exponents of the last - layer diverge in a line of critical end points diverging from those of the whole film. the specific exponents are the same for the disordered and the ordered phases, independently of their exchange integrals. at a given surface coupling, two possible phase transitions are found : ( i ) a surface transition with ordered surface and disordered bulk which leads to the surface critical temperature deviating from that of the ordinary one, or ( ii ) a _ surface transition _ with both surface and bulk transverse field deviating behaviors. the discussion presented in this paper focuses on the present status of the study of these two and the future perspectives of this topic.
we analyse the formation of ripples and dunes in aeolian sandy rivers by means of a hydrodynamic analysis of a flat sand bed. this allows us to provide a general framework to describe, with only few key variables, the sediment transport properties. we first discuss the origin of a saturated state and then propose a self - consistent model, predicting the main characteristics of transport : the static threshold, the saturation length and the saturated flux. we then concentrate on a different mode of transport, associated to ripples, which form by a linear instability. we show that the excitation of standing waves at the surface has a stabilising effect, independently of the details of the flow and sediment transport models. two stabilising mechanisms are identified : the sediment transfer length @xmath0 and the slope effect, which however depends on the balance of shear velocity and deposition rate. we provide field evidences in the leyre river, in france, showing that the wavelength at which ripples form is systematically larger for rougher grains. further observations suggest that mega - dunes form when the sand bed presents hetereogeneities such as a wide distribution of grain sizes. finally, we review and discuss the available in the literature in the light of these theoretical and experimental results. * the true nature of dunes and ripples remains elusive. one of the main difficulties in interpretation of the observed dunes is that they are formed by a non - linear instability close to the resonant condition of surface waves. hydrodynamics provides a good framework for the understanding of these problems ( see, e.g., @xcite ). although not directly comparable to the predictions of a linear stability analysis, these data show distinct scaling laws for hydraulically smooth and rough granular beds. as shown in part 1 and in agreement with standard hydraulics, the gravity waves excited at the free surface by the bedforms are in phase at small ripples ( supercritical regime ) and in antiphase at large dunes ( simple dune regime ). we suggest a new definition of ripple based on the physical mechanisms which control their formation. *
the microlensing technique has recently been applied to the detection of extrasolar planets by using the technique of direct imaging. it has a unique applicability to the detections of free - floating planets and it can be extended even to planets of nearby stars with well - defined separations ( @xmath0 ). two high - magnification events reported recently by two follow - up experiments are giving high priority to this method. little has been studied about the characteristics of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them ( central perturbationations ). using magnification maps with source stars of main - sequence, turn - off, and clump giant stars, we systematically investigate the patterns of central perturations and the planetary values of the magnifications of the individual images. the maps show the following properties of central cavities : ( 1 ) we find that the effect of finite source size on the planetary caustic is much more severe than that on the corresponding cusp of planetary lensing. this is due to the increase of the planet / star mass ratio with the decrease of the source size. ( 2 ) the shape of the central causpic is solely dependent on the planet separation. for example, for a planetary system with a mass ratio of 1/2, the magnification of a point source is computed by the intensity - weighted magnification averaged over the source star surface, i.e., the total magnification. for a source with uniform surface brightness, the computation can be reduced from a two - dimensional to a one - dimensional integral using the generalized stokes s theorem. ( 3 ) by adopting the planetary perturbative approximation, we evaluate the probability of a primary star returning to its original position after a lensing event. our results suggest that the primary star does not return to the origin of its initial position on background stars significantly. ( 4 ) we construct three sets of magnification maps for planets with various values of de - magnified magnitudes of stars, each one of which is described by the planetary lens equation under a different approximation. we find the following types of planets : a ` wide - separation planet ', a ` close - in planet', and a ` planet close to the neptune - mass limit '. the planets with orbital periods longer than a few times the age of the earth are not detectable, while centroids and planets with the masses of the larger planet are within the detection limit for given source stars with various sizes. however, for the planetary searches with the present - day technology
we present results on the location, origin and abundance information of nine uncorrelated narrow absorption lines ( nals ) in the high redshift quasar rx j1230.31 + 514251.0, which are used to probe the quasar environment. the nals are resolved by using multi - slit spectra from @xmath0 = 1400 to 6200 km s@xmath1 and span a range of velocities from -1400 to -6200 km / s, with line optical depths from 0.02 to 0.98. all of the systems detected in are grouped as well as two others that are not detected in the lyman series and other absorption lines. the group of nine nals forms a complete complex of nine distinct c iv nal systems at a velocity range from 1400 to 6100 km / sec from the redshift of the source. we use c iv variability diagnostics to study the properties of the nal gas, and find that ( 1 ) four of the nine systems are consistent with being associated with a quasar outflow, ( 2 ) six systems exhibit partial covering of the non - thermal continuum source light, ( 3 ) exhibit smooth continua between the source and outflow optical depths, ( 4 ) exhibit a complex pattern of broad profiles with multiple components, and ( 5 ) seven systems appear to be located in intervening gas. systems 1, 2, 3 and 4 are associated with starburst - driven outflows, whereas systems 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are likely to be in an outflow formed in the host galaxy. we measure column densities that are significantly higher than solar, in agreement with previous results based on broad emission line ( bel results ), and lower than or consistent with solar metallicity. we argue that the high metallicities found for this group of nals require that its host galaxy experienced vigorous star formation at the epoch of formation. consequently metal - rich gas is abundant in this quasar, which likely formed during the peak in quasar activity and demonstrates that quasars are forming stars at a high fraction of their eddington limit. consequently, we expect the central quasar to have grown by at least an order of magnitude in the last gyr, and for this reason we suggest that the final stages of quasar evolution might have occurred very recently.
we study the dynamical behaviour of a three level atom in a region of phase space where the transitions from a quantum harmonic oscillator to a coherent photonic cavity are coupled to a structured reservoir of electromagnetic field modes. we treat the system by means of a markovian master equation approach. the problem is then solved via non - orthogonal eigenfunctions methods. we find that there are differences in the dynamics from the simpler case of two transitions coupled to one single reservoir, as in the earlier work of dikolopoulos,nikolopoulos andopoulos [ phys. rev. lett. * 106 *, 120401 ( 2000 ) ]. the dynamics in this situation is mainly controlled by a single structured reservoir structure function, the photon excitation probability, and the sequence in which the two photons are emitted. however, in only a few of the cases involved in this paper, the structured reservoir is not single, but two separate reservoirs. this leads to a difference in the behaviour of the system, with the excited atomic state in the lower half of the frequency plane and the field modes in the upper state. the different behaviour can be understood by considering two transitions, one excited and one in the vacuum state, and with the remaining modes being in the continuum. this is both a physical situation, where the transition frequencies are the same for both transitions, and a very complicated one, where two transitions are at different frequencies and one emission is involved in the empty state. in the last few years, a large amount of work has been devoted to the description of systems coupled to structured reservoirs, and in particular cases involving high q cavities ( e.g. photonic band gap materials ), and to the quantum properties of excited atomic states ( quantum langevin equations and master equations ). this has been partly motivated by the possibility of manipulating the properties of optically excited two level atoms via the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effect @xcite, in particular with respect to stimulated emission from an optical cavity, so that the _ nature _ of the photons could be completely different from that in the usual single - photon case of an optically quiet cavity. in this case, instead, the dynamics can be completely controlled by the reservoir structure functions, the only remaining interaction being the excitation of the atom to a different mode ( or pair of modes ) in the reservoir. the consequences for the atomic and field behaviour have been investigated extensively, with methods based on state decomposition and on pseudo - mode theory for photonic
we numerically study the topological properties of thin films of pyrochlore iridates, i.e., the weyl - sm phase with periodic band crossing at the fermi level and gapped insulator and antiferromagnetically aligned chern vectors. we show that the surface states of the thin films carry large chern numbers, which in principle can be proportional to the thickness of the film. moreover, we find two types of metallic conducting channels in the films associated with the gapped system, one at the domain wall and the other at the surface, which are carried by two surface states whose wave function widths are exponentially small in thick films. in contrast to the case of the system having only one chern vector, we study the crossover phenomena in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk and thin films. we find that the nontrivial topological property of the systems derived from the bulk insulator can be manifested in the emergence of emergent topological phenomena as follows. the anomalous hall conductance of the third - order periodic lattice hamiltonian is due to the presence of two different classes of conducting channels : one related to the geometrical reason of the lattice structure and other to the complicated topology of the underlying system. * topological phase diagram and emerging topological behaviors * * in five dimensional ( 5d ) tmo thin films * * pacs number(s ) : 74.25.ud *, 74.20.mh *, 25.75.+v,05.10.+b,25.75 in a recent recent experiment@xcite based on the use of topological insulators, it has been observed that great progress has been made in the understanding of unconventional topological behavior of artificial superstructures such as thin films @xcite. considering the growing experimental efforts to make 5d topological semi - metal alloys, it is expected that interesting experimental data on the behavior of the local magnetoresistance would be available in near future. this work paves the way to explore the new emergent phenomena of 5d metallic thin films in both theory and experiment, which offers a useful guidance for more sophisticated numerical studies such as the first - principle calculations and experiments. to guide the experimental interpretation of our results, we propose a simple but realistic tight - binding model that accurately captures the essential physical properties of the 3d system, and we discuss the effects of the different surface states in a transparent system dominated by weyl
the movement of surface - bound membrane domains in supported lipid bilayers is known to be lvy - like ( where the step displacements have a heavy - tailed distribution ). here we report on the observation of anomalous diffusion in the presence of bulk excursions for two membrane - targeting domain profiles that exhibit desorption from the membrane within the experimental observation time. the analysis is performed by analysing the time - averaged mean squared displacement ( msd ) as a function of lag time. we find that the msd is superlinear in lag time, with an average value of @xmath0. this behaviour provides a new way to define lvy flight in the search for sparse targets in a living cell. diffusion is ubiquitous in cell biology and it is feasible to assume that evolution has optimized search parameters. however, the ergodic hypothesis breaks down for c2a molecules. thus we can envision that if a molecule does not find its target in a given time, it becomes more efficient to start searching for it by moving it further away. the problem of efficient search is also related to the structure of the lipid bilayer. bilayer membranes are composed of several proteins that interact with each other and the membrane itself. lipids are more generally compartmentalized than proteins and tend to stay transiently in small regions. even so, membrane proteins and lipids can exhibit subdiffusive diffusion with anti - persistent increments, where molecules drift towards the positions that have been previously visited in the past. as a consequence, there can be a large variety of new ways of searching for targets. a major advantage of cell biology is that it provides a forum to examine the effects of different processes on the search process. by tracking the motion of membrane - bound domain profiles in supported bilayers, we can then extrapolate to timescales that are independent of the size of the target. this extension will help us to understand the emergence of superdiffusion and its implications for cell biological processes.
we give a simple proof of a theorem which says that a cat(0 ) space of covering dimension @xmath0 acts properly discontinuously by semi - simple isometries. the proof is based on flat discs of isometrically embedded dihedral artin groups, and on a certain pair of rank 2 abelian subgroups of the dihedral type artin group. * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 58e05, 57m20, 34c25. * keywords and phrases : * semi -simple isometry, flat discs, piecewise euclidean and spherical complex. in the paper we began by explaining the basic structure of flat discs using basic assumptions which may be found in many other works, including @xcite, chapter ii.6. in this paper we completely classify flat discs with all elements in view of the flat torus theorem, and also make some predictions about the structure of flats with different elements. these results will be used in the proof of proposition [ b(a, b ) ], which states that a finite subgroup of any artin 2-complex of constant riemannian curvature must _ properly _ discontinuously be servitely updated in case the subgroup is composed of two non - singular objects. the paper continues with the following minor ingredient : we give a certain criterion for determining whether or not a given artin2-complex ( or any other related complex ) with finitely many shapes is locally cat(1 ), i.e. whether there exists a geodesic metric between any pair of points such that the endpoints are mapped to one another by a hyperbolic isometry. the criterion relies on two special cases. in a first case, the intersection of two flat planes with different heights is resolved by the presence of a connection between the outer segments of the complex, and in the second case it is precisely the alexandrov angle between the flat intersecting segments that are shown to be connected by a metric. the construction of the necessary connections between these flat planes and the intrinsic curves of the metric may be studied in future papers of this series. *
we present a theoretical model of nova light curves in which the optical ( @xmath0 ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) light curves are dominated by free - free emission from the optically thin, optically thick, ejecta. we extend our model to include the effects of the white dwarf mass, chemical composition of the envelope, and the companion star thermal condition, which is widely applicable to optical and ir light curves of novae. a sequence of steady - state solutions for nova outbursts is calculated by considering the nova envelope to be in a steady state, after which time the envelope mass is decreased by the winds and nuclear burning. because the winds are driven by the strong peak of opal opacity, the wind - blown flux drops very quickly after the optical peak. this is because the energy generation during the wind phase depends on the total amount of cno but hardly on the chemical composition. we assume that c or o ( or ne ) is dredged up from the wd interior during the very early phase of the outburst and then mixed into the entire envelope by convection. we calculate optical and uv light curves by using the same method and also by applying it to three well observed novae, v1500 cygni, v1668 cyg, and v1974 cyg. we find that the optical flux is a good indicator of wd mass if we assume a single white dwarf. the turn - on time is the earliest part of the x - ray / turn - off time and is particularly important in the optical / uv band, because it is the longest and most variable of all parameters. except for the early in the outburst, the uv 1455 light curve is well fitted by a single template light curve having a universal decline law. we also find that in the ultraviolet band, the flux at the optical and infrared wavelengths is a power law with a photon index of 1.0. this suggests that the ultraviolet light curve of a typical nova may be composed of many components, i.e., many mag brighter in the early phase and less dense in the late phase, which may be reflected in the later uv and optical fluxes. we compare our model light curves with the _ iue _ and _ rosat _ data of v1624 cyg and v1455. we confirm that the former is a best - fit model light curve and that its optical decay is due to the large variation of the luminosity with wavelength. we apply our method to
we consider the localization functor functor of an associative unital ring in the weyl group. in the commutative case, such functors give rise to translations invariant quasicoherent sheaves over the embedding spaces of the unipotent subgroups of the lie group. we prove that such sheaves extend to an algebraic subvariety of the noncommutative quasischeme functor in the same way as in the case of trivializing covers. as an example, we give a proof for the existence of a zariski locally trivialization of an @xmath0-comodule algebra in the presence of a perelomb mod 2 subgroup. the geometry of the quantum universe is a very hot topic of current interest. in particular, the problem of understanding the quantum version of localization functors has been of interest for some time. efforts have focused on understanding the role of quasicritical quasiparticles over the categories of equivalence classes of ( quasi)algebras. this question is particularly interesting in connection with the topics considered in @xcite : on the one hand, the structure of unital variety fields in qcd has been addressed by comparing the global cover functors of various polynomial functors ( see for instance@xcite ). on the other hand, realizable examples in geometry and topology have been considered. in this paper we report an important result on the level of local trivialization functors for qcd operations on a variety fields having a local quotient of global cover. the result gives a necessary condition for the global quotient to have a given identity. in section [ sec : qcd ], we define the set of all faithful localizations of an unital extension of a hopf algebra, and the lorentz group of the associated vector bundle functor. we will discuss the consequences of this result for the interpretation of global coinvariants, and we will open up the possibility of using it to gain a new insight into the dynamics of ( quantum ) quantum cosmology. for instance, in the special case of weakly interacting fermions in the local coverings setting, the globality of qcd may be understood as a consequence of the fact that in the unitarity class of the quotient functor, which is in turn induced by the trivializing cover.
we introduce a block lanczos ( bl ) recursive technique which constructs, without losing any geometrical information of the lattice, quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) models suitable for density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations, from single- as well as multiple - impurity anderson models in any spatial dimensions. this new approach, named bl - dmrrg method, enables us to calculate directly the real - space quantities, including both static and dynamical quantities, where the initial impurity site and the conduction electron density are separated by only finite discretization space. we also introduce symmetry adapted bl bases, which are the symmetry adapted spin - spin correlation functions, to reduce the dimension of the local hilbert space, which can be further reduced by using spin degrees of freedom and thus increase the accuracy of the calculations. to this end, we apply the proposed method to three different models for graphene with a structural defect and with a single absorbed atom to examine the resulting magnetic properties and the kondo effect. indeed, we find that the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and the local density of states at the impurity sites are qualitatively different when compared with the noninteracting case. moreover, the two impurity models with no kondo screening exhibit a spin singlet state, while the model with a kondo cloud has a spin 1/2 per adatom or vacancy. these results are also applied to the recent experimental studies on graphene with structural defects and with hydrogen or fluorine adatoms where the formation of local magnetic moments and kondo signatures have been clearly observed. we further discuss the relevance of our results to the recently proposed magnetic impurity methods in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods. especially, we show that the bl - recursive technique can be used to construct quasiparticle hybridization functions which are needed for the dynamical mean - field calculations in qmc.
we report on an event in which a large polar crown filament of length @xmath0 days ago showed large amplitude oscillation in its pre - eruptive, slow - rise phase before its eruption. the oscillation was most clearly seen in 195 images taken by the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ), including 171 images in the linear frame of h@xmath1, 170 in the plane of the sky and 115 in the far - infrared ( faint object imaging ). in addition to the optical data, we found evidence of an excitation mechanism using magnetic - field data. in particular, an oscillation with a large amplitude occurred in a small part of the filament. this oscillation lasted for about two hours and could be visualized by the temporal slices along the filament s semi - major axis for about 15 hours. the spatial displacement due to the oscillations was identified with the alfvn waves seen at 17 ghz from nobeyama radio heliograph. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a large - amplitude, spatially resolved, large - frequency oscillation of a filament in microwave imaging. we further examine the possible excitation mechanisms responsible for theoscation. magnetic reconnection appears to be the most likely explanation for the excitation. if the slow rise was triggered by an initial growth of an instability ( loe or instability ), _ i.e. _, loss of equilibrium or growth of mass, then the instability would have occurred at a local equilibrium state, which is non - linear in time scale. this type of instability is similar to those that have been found commonly associated with large amplitude filament eruptions ( e.g., filament eruption ). however, in many such events the whole filament does not erupt simultaneously. instead, in some cases there is an asymmetry in the dynamics between the leading and trailing filaments ; the leading filament erupts first and the remaining parts seem to be dragged by the trailing filament. therefore, the dynamical mechanism likely dominates in this case. we also discuss the implications of the observed in this event on the formation of an asymmetric ( slow rise ) oscillation.
the current paradigm for forming isolated, low - mass stars begins with isolated, lightly - ionized molecular clouds. however, the question of how dense cores evolve beyond the critical radius when the magnetic pressure is comparable to, or even smaller than, the thermal pressure requires clarification. i have followed the evolution of a magnetized, spherical cloud core for several decades, following its dynamical evolution with a self - consistent, dynamical model self - consistently evaluated at each step. the evolution is followed numerically using a code that takes full advantage of the simplified geometry underlying the present study. the cloud and field evolution is then followed self - alternatively by a three - dimensional lagrangian code with appropriate formulae for the coupling coefficient between magnetic fields and the cloud matter, which controls the cloud evolution. this treatment yields a model for the inward motion of the cloud that is either flat ( a ` ` starless '' cloud ) or has a plateau - envelope type profile ( a more - or - less constant density plateau at the center surrounded by an envelope which density decreases with radius roughly as a power - law ). the latter feature indicates that the density and the field strength at the edge are fixed at their initial values, at all times, and remain there if the cloud is roundish. in this model, the outward expansion is driven by ambipolar diffusion of the magnetic field material from the ionized dust grains, while the inward contraction is controlled by the inward diffusion of magnetic material. because the outward motion is slow compared to the sound speed, clouds with @xmath0 are always contracting ; even if the initial pressure is as high as, or larger than, 10@xmath1 the density plateau disappears and the envelope is always roundish, suggesting that the cloud may be contracting at its average value throughout the evolution. the general implications of these calculations for the star formation process are discussed. it is concluded that dense cores with an initial magnetic pressure comparable to that of the neutral matter may have an internal diameter of at most a few pc, and thus may not be well - mixed ", at least qualitatively. this result may have important implications for the protostellar mass growth and for the proto - solar nebula.
we report on the observations of the x ray point sources in the vicinity of the galactic center ( gc ) region performed with the @xmath0 narrow field camera ( mecs ) and imaging camera ( art - p coded mask ) instruments on board the _ hubble space telescope_. our survey covers an area of 4 degrees in the direction of sgra, and covers an energy range of 0.1 kev to 300 kev. our survey shows that a few persistently bright sources characterize the constellation of x ray sources in this region. their properties indicate they consist of compact accreting objects similar to the classical accretion powered sources found elsewhere in the galaxy. their mass and position, derived from x ray luminosities, are consistent with those derived from radio observations. slx 1744299/300, at b = 1.359.92, is clearly detected, while several other sources ( e.g., ks 1741293, xte j1748 - 288 ) are present in the survey, but probably less numerous than expected. there is marginal evidence of an additional source population of somewhat fluorescent origin, probably of radioactive origin. we have compared the results of our observations with those obtained with the rosat ( predehl & trumper, 1994 ) and, more recently, with asca ( maeda et al. 1996, 1998 ). the results presented here are the best yet observational constraints for the diffuse x ray emission in the gc region. we can not exclude that also the other rosat sources contribute to some of the detected x rays. assuming an eddington luminosity at the burst peak, we obtain a distance of 4.9 kpc, a blackbody radius of 25.0 au and a mass of 1.7@xmath16.7 m@xcite. the sources detected with the mecs have better angular resolution ( 50 % angular radius at 6 kev, on the axis ), and a moderate energy resolution ( fwhm @xcite ) of @xma0 degrees at 8 kev compared with that of rosat. assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for the compact objects, the best fit is consistent with the galactic fountain model. the origin of the diffuse emission is less clear, but has been suggested to be a luminous low - mass x ray binary, either an accretion disk or a bursting pulsar. such a system could be associated with the sgra supernova remnant g0.9 + 0
we test the curvature - effect hypothesis for the origin of grb prompt emission and the x - ray flares by analyzing the xrt early data of a sample of 22 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected by the swift xrt. our analysis shows that a steep decay component following the prompt emission is consistent with the expectation of the model, i.e. the swift prompt emission tail is always produced in internal shocks. the steep decay slope of the tail is inversely proportional to the grb trigger time, which indicates that the flares are of internal origin if the forward shock model is correct. the flare tails usually show rapid rise and fall in time with the ratio of the variability time scale and the epoch of the flare. this gives strong support to the internal origin of these flares, and calls for central engine models that can operate as long as @xmath0 1 day. assuming that the flare or emission episode is internal and independent of the central engine, the fitted ` ` curvature curves '' can be used to partially disentangle the external and internal emission scenarios. we find that for most grbs the ` ` late - time curvature '' s are always right at the beginning of the rising segment of the last flare or the start of the decaying phase, which usually corresponds to the direction of the primary emission episode. for some grbs, the late flares are even right before the rising part of the flares, which suggests an erratic central engine activity on timescales of hours to days. the location of the curve with respect to the trigger tends to change within the burst. these results indicate that the early xrt light curves are often dominated by distortions caused by non - simultaneous emission from multiple emission components at different times, and that the detection of the curved decay slope in x - rays is a valuable diagnostic to discriminate between the internal and external emission mechanisms. 0.5 cm _ swift - cambridge laboratory, department of physics, columbia university, new york, ny 10027, usa _ 0.1 cm 0.2 cm _ max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik, giessenbachstrae, d-85748 garching, germany _
the results of a new study of the environments of classical double radio sources, also known as frii sources, based on a sample of 35 sources with redshift in the range @xmath0, are presented. the sample includes 13 radio galaxy bridges and 3 radio loud quasar bridges, which have average sizes close to the average size of the full population located at the same redshift. the pressure of the ambient gas in the vicinity of the frii radio sources is estimated using a new method based on only the radio data, which is based on the relationship between the beam power of the source and the non - thermal pressure of its radio lobe. this new method does not require a spectral aging analysis, and provides a powerful tool to probe the possible environments of frii multiple sources. the results presented here are complementary to those presented in previous papers, where the increase in radio luminosity and decrease in radio source size for high - redshift sources were explained in terms of an increase of the average core radius of the radio lobe with decreasing ambient gas density. the new method results in that the average thickness of radio bridge does not depend on the lobe advance speed, and the lobe propagation velocity is not well constrained from the current data. a steep gradient in the average density of the diffuse ambient gas, as obtained from studies of 3cr sources, is found to be a result of the steep increase in the degree of central density at the center of the clusters in which the sources reside, while the core radius remains roughly constant at the highest redshifts. the decrease of the fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) equation of state parameter, which describes the gaseous environments of powerful frii source is also seen in the sample, and agrees with the results obtained using x - ray data. the average beam power, which measures the energy extraction rate from the agn by the jet, is relatively constant over the lifetime of a source. the inferred total gravitational mass of the host cluster from the radio source is estimated as a function of redshift using the radio spectral index, although a significant dependence on redshift is found. a logarithmic function in absolute magnitude and a cosmological constant is assumed to be responsible for the observed redshift evolution of the mean value of the constant beam power. the cluster mass estimates are found to increase with increasing redshift, which supports the idea that the existence of powerful powerful radio outflows plays an important role in determining the global properties of the universe.
we discuss the physical properties of the recurrent nova u sco, which has been recently found to be the best candidate for the immediate progenitor of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ). constructing a theoretical light curve of the outburst, we obtain the luminosity of the white dwarf ( wd ) envelope during the quiescent phase between the 1949 and 1987 outbursts. the early linear phase ( @xmath0 days ) of the light curve shows that a large part of the envelope mass has been blown off in the outburst wind and the remaining part is carried into the interior of the accretion disk and eventually accumulated on the wd. the mass accretion rate during the optical maximum depends very sensitively on the details of the color and mass absorption absorptions. the best fit color index suggests a large excess of the intrinsic wd optical luminosity with respect to the eddington limit. we also calculate the visual magnitude and variability of the early light curve to find out the best fitting value for the ratio of the peak optical to near - infrared flux density, and find a value close to 2.8@xmath1 + 0.5 for the effective temperatures of the surfaces of the ms and of the acdk. the optical to nir spectra have a broad range, which means that the broad absorption feature is due to many - body effects. we estimate the mass - absorption excess due to the different nuclear absorptions and find that the theoretical color index is not very useful to constrain the redshift of the sn ia unless a substantial amount of hydrogen is present in the system. we have calculated the distance to v394 cra using the best - fit model of the optical light curve. the distance modulus of the system is 0.083, which corresponds to a distance of 0.053 kpc. based on this value, we have determined the optical peak luminosity and the color index of the best fitted model suggests an intrinsic color excess ratio of 1.08. 0.25truecm = -0.24truecm 0.2truecm [ firstpage ] accretion, accretion discs stars : novae, recurrent novae : individual : u scorpius, cataclysmic variables
we consider nonradial gravity - modes ( g - modes ) observed in da white dwarfs which have shallow surface convection zones overlying stably stratified interiors. we elucidate the mechanism(s ) responsible for the overstability of these modes in these stars. initial calculations of overstable modes were carried out using the adiabatic, quasiadiabatic wave equation of brickhill ( @xcite ). these workers ignored the fact that the thermal time - scale in the layer of partial ionization, @xmath0, is many orders of magnitude smaller than the periods of the g - mode periods. in this paper, we concentrate on the case of zz cetis. we derive expressions relating various perturbation quantities associated with g modes to those associated with the photosphere and the convection zone. since modes propagate through the lower photosphere, they are overstable in the outer parts of the stellar envelope. this is the case also in the radiative interior, where the decay of the perturbed radiative flux is faster than diffusion. we apply these results to a da white dwarf model with a self - consistent radiative - transfer disc. this model is used to derive a new technique for convective driving, which we describe in detail. finally, we examine the stability of the wkb eigenfunction, and we show that it is stable against variation by more than an order of magnitude.

we re - examine the old _ asca _ data on the bright, high - luminosity radio - loud quasar 3c 273, and present results for three new observations ( 1996 july, 1998 june, and 1999 july ). we conclude that the @xmath0 fluorescent emission line is indeed broad, just like that seen in seyfert 1 galaxies. the equivalent width of the line is 0.094, with a 90 % confidence upper limit of 0.20. this is consistent with previous results, and is not inconsistent with a model in which the line photons are emitted in a disk rotating around a central schwarzschild black hole. data with simultaneous _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ observations indicate that the inclination angle of the disk can be reduced by a roughly magnitude with an effect factor of 2.7. using all instruments simultaneously, we obtain the best - fitting line parameters ( line width, equivalent width, line energy ) for three observations. we find that two of the three fits are consistent with zero, while the others give a consistent value, well below the zero line width limit. thus, compton - reflection does not affect our conclusion. we also determine the pca fluxes for the two new observations that could constrain the line energy. we compute the fluxes in the 1.5 kev ( 210 kev ) band for the three _ as cais _ observations and find them to be inconsistent with the prior results. we determine the flux in the 200 kev band from the _ raxte _ data and find it to be very close to the mean flux of the _asca _ observations. the significance of this result is unclear because quasars are only observed face - on and it is not clear whether or not there is an evolution in the line properties with time.
we report on _ chandra _ observations of the accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsars xte j0929314 ( @xmath0@xmath1 ergs s@xday2 ) and xe j1751305 ( n=1.438 ). our results show that ( a ) the quiescent x - rays are dominated by a power - law component ( with over 90 % of the 0.510 kev flux possibly due to such a component ) and ( b ) the emission in the range 0.5 to 10 kev is dominated by the power -law component. this result is consistent with the neutron star model proposed by brown and collaborators over 30 years ago. we could not find evidence for spectral variability or quantitative upper limits on the source fluxes ( accurate to a few percent level ) during our observation. moreover, we found that the spectra are expected to be dominated by thermal components ( whether a black - body or a neutron - star atmosphere model ) but could not detect any statistically significant thermal component. on the other hand, sax j1808.43658, which is the only accreting millisecond pulsar to be observed in quiescence, exhibits a high fractional contribution of power - laws. however, while in this case the contribution is marginal, the fact that some sources exhibit such a soft spectrum is apparently common in these systems. if this is the case, then the conditions for the existence of a thermal component in accreted neutron star transients must be very favourable. we also find that ( d ) the source luminosity decreases when the quencescent source luminosities get lower ; this behavior seems to be uniquely due to the energy range rather than to the comparison luminosity of the neutron stars.

we present the results of new observations of the radio structure in the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a. the images were obtained with the australia telescope compact array at 20 cm resolution and have revealed, in particular, several features in the _ optical filaments _ in the region between the northern inner lobe and the nuclear region ( nml ). these features have been used to investigate the structure of the nml, and in particular to understand the interaction between the radio plasma and the ism / igm. the large scale radio structure can be described as the result of a relativistic jet that has changed its position angle during its life and that has undergone also a strong interaction with the environment. the mechanical flux of a mildly supersonic low - density jet interacting with dense clouds at the location of the filaments is sufficient to energize the shock waves through the production of a kelvin - helmholtz instability in the dense cloud. according to our new images, the jet is located at a position angle of about @xmath02 kpc away from the inner radio jet. however, at the same position angle, another field, at a different location from the jet, has also been observed. this field shows a depolarizing screen around the radio lobe. the position angles of the magnetic vectors are very constant across this region, with a typical p.a. of about 50 and a median fractional polarization of between 50 and 60 %. furthermore, the radio morphology can be related to the way the plasma is transported from the active nucleus to the outer lobes. the images presented here show, in agreement with previous studies, a significant number of features, including : ( i ) the extended emission line regions of highly ionized gas ( known as _ the filament _ ) ; ( ii ) a bright ridge of radio emission in the east side of the lobe ; ( iii ) positions and fwhm of several arcmin ; ( iv ) the radio and optical structures in the southern outer lobe, and ( v ) the _ einstein observatory _ ( feigelson et al. 1979 ). in the following, we will discuss the implications of our new observations for modelling the radio source in active galaxies.
we present analysis of the intrinsic uv absorption in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783, based on an intensive monitoring campaign with the _ hubble space telescope_/stis and _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _/space telescope imaging spectrographs. the uv continuum in the inner narrow line region ( nlr ) of this galaxy was observed in a ranged of flux states, spanning a factor @xmath0 2.5 of the ionizing continuum flux. we find variability in the ionic populations in response to the continuum variations. time - dependent populations are computed in each absorption state in order to constrain their physical conditions, including the density and ionization structure in the outflow. we explore a coverage model for the inner nlr based on the individual covering factors of the continuum and broad emission lines from the lyman lines. the covering factor of this nlr is found to be a factor of ten lower than that of the nlr in the low - ionization states, implying further inhomogeneities in the flow. we detect metastable, uv - active absorption in component 1a, which is weakly detected in the x - ray spectrum and has a temperature that is consistent with photoionization from the central agn. the properties observed in this absorber are consistent with an electron column density that is ten - times higher than that measured in the higgs - system, consistent with the number density that has been put forward by @xcite. we present measurements of the absorption parameters and variability for the components 1 and 2, and compare them to the results from previous studies. the decrease in radial velocity observed in both absorbers implies they are dynamically and co - located. we demonstrate that the lowest - level populations in the absorbers are linked to the intergalactic medium and are likely to be spatially extended, inversionally confined regions of ionization that are embedded in the more diffuse component 1b gas. we estimate the physical conditions in the rest of the flow for this uv absorber, and find it to have a number density of log(@xmath1 7.5 ) = 5.0@xft10.5. our modeling results for the other components indicate the gas in the three kinematic components is at least partially inhomogeneous, with some of the components outflow components being embedded in dense, compact regions of high ionization gas that may be destined to evaporate.
the fermionic condensate and vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor for a massive fermion field in the geometry of two parallel plates on a spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions are investigated. we impose generalized periodicity conditions along the compact dimensions with arbitrary phases and mit bag boundary conditions on the single plates. the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed as well. the total casimir energy @xmath0 is computed and related to the periodicity period of the plates. it is found that, in the asymptotic case, the topological volumetric density of the fermions is a function of the radius of the background spacetime and is independent of the topology of the spacetime. the variance of the vacuum fluctuations in the region between the plates is described by the eigenfunctions and eigenmodes of the dirac equation in the case when the field is massive. in the limit of a small ratio of the dimensionless massless field to the size of the space of compact spatial dimensions, the main contribution to the casimir force resulting from the magnetic field is given by a spinor field coupled to the bosonic background field and its pressure. for a non - massive field, the bulk field gives a contribution acting as the source in einstein s equations. this contribution is insignificant in most cases. it can, however, be detected and subtracted analytically in certain limiting cases. the vacuum expectables of electrons in carbon nanotubes can be modeled as the sum of a pure topological contribution and interference parts due to the different thickness of the nanotube and the role played by the carriers of the electron energy in the nanowire. the interference parts are given by the density of electron - phonon pairs and the plasma - electrodynamical interactions in the ultracold isotropic case. for the case of a chiral background, the vacuum exioms in the tristability limit give rise to casimir - type contributions to the vacuum expectation values of physical observables. these can be interpreted as the amplitudes for the radionuclidean and super - amplitudes of the photon, as well as for the vacuum potentials and dark energy.
we present results from a correlation analysis of the x - ray emission from 53 nearby highly - inclined disc galaxies. the sample covers a broad range of sfr, morphological type, stellar mass, and clustering environment, and thus allows us to investigate environmental effects in the coronae. several results are obtained : \(1 ) a strong correlation is present between the coronal soft excess of @xmath0 ( with respect to the starburst galaxy median luminosity ) and the sfr. the same linear relation holds for both starburst and non - starburst galaxies. \(2 ) a tighter correlation is found between @xfig0 ( between the galaxy median stellar mass and the baryon tully - fisher relation ), the total sne mechanical energy input rate including contributions from both core collapsed and type ia sne. \(3 ) for the full sample ( 73 galaxies ), there is a fairly sharp ( negative ) dependence on the ratio of fe / o luminosity to that of h. the fe - rich galaxies tend to have low fe /o ratios ( corresponding to the ` ` g dwarf '' regime ), while the halo metal - rich ones have higher ratios. we also find a potential for a correlation between the mass loading of cool gas and the hot gas luminosity. \(4 ) due to diversities in the population of galaxies, the galactic coronae can exhibit different regimes of temperature, density, and iron - to - oxygen abundance ratio. we herein speculate two possible scenarios, based on the different contributions of supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds ( icm ). in the icm scenario, sne induce a large range of coronal temperatures, in particular by stripping, while in the sn case, mass loading plays an important role. thus, we consider both mechanisms and conclude that the different abundance regimes are most likely to be the result of a complex combination of effects including many uncertainties in the ionization conditions and in the circumstellar medium.

we report the results of a large sample of actively star - forming early - type galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey using @xmath0-band images and spectroscopic data. this sample is dominated by sfe e galaxies, which are k+a galaxies of morphological type e and s0 that show evidence for currently active star formation. from a comparison of the star formation episodes within these galaxies to those in normal elliptical and lenticular galaxies, we find that the current star formation in these galaxies is most likely taking place within rotationally supported disks. the gas kinematics of the majority of these galaxies are consistent with the star forming regions being contained within disks. since there are no galaxies with clearly visible nuclear disks, we do not search for any evidence for gas stripping in our sample. instead, the only plausible explanation for a lack of such disks is that the galaxies are experiencing a particularly short star formation episode or that some other process is responsible for the lack of s0s among the e / s0 galaxies. the starburst masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) of the most viable models are found to be similar to those of the low mass field galaxies at similar redshifts. this implies that the time for these star forming galaxies to form is likely to be significantly less than the hubble time. we suggest that the most likely progenitors of the e galaxies are either mergers or highly stochastic interactions or otherwise violent galaxy - galaxy interactions. if the mergers produce a significant fraction of the elliptical galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, we would expect that the resulting remnant population would be composed predominantly of mergers, while the resulting stellar mass formed within the remnants of such mergers would be less than what is observed. conversely, if the merger / accretion events that lead to the formation of the largest ellipticals are triggered and/or truncated by gas stripping, then the surviving ellipticals with moderate stellar masses will only increase their stellar masses by a relatively small fraction.

we present the results of a model atmosphere analysis of seven hydrogen - rich central stars of planetary nebulae ( pne ). they belong to the class of ` ` old '' pne, which are the crucial precursors of white dwarfs. for all stars the high effective temperatures derived from the balmer lines ( h@xmath0k, @xmath1 ) are close to the temperature of the white dwarf central star. using data from the palomar - green and eso surveys we have tested the validity of the assumption of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ), which is commonly assumed in many white dwarf analyses. it could be shown that lte is a very good approximation for temperatures below 40000k. however, this approximation is an unlikely origin for the low temperatures found in the observations. none of the stars in this study have a very hot helium - rich surface layer. this is in contradiction to the predictions of theoretical calculations, which require such stars to have a thick hydrogen - layer. based on the observed hydrogen abundance ratio of hydrogen - poor to h - rich stars, we have derived that only very few stars have a surface hydrogen layer. since the vast majority of such stars are hot ( temperatures above 60000k ), this leads to serious problems for the interpretation of many observational results, including those concerning the distance scale. on the other hand, line blanketing by the stark broadened hydrogen lines is taken into account and found to be a very important factor for a small fraction of white dwarf stars. using the line spectrum of, an acceptable solution for isochrones is found. the lines allow us to identify the spectral type of the central stars. most of them are of type d or f0v. since is relatively bright, it is likely that these central stars are late main sequence stars, just past the cooling phase. this fact supports the scenario of the pre - white dwarf evolution. we have also compared our results with those obtained for and compare their properties with those of,, and. the discrepancy is severe, due to the fact that is of the same spectral type or even earlier.
these notes are a written version of four lectures given at tasi-02 on the topic of _ flavourdynamics_. the first lecture is an introduction to weak hadronic decays in the standard model. the study of these decays will lead to a determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements @xmath0, which are necessary to determine the non - perturbative heavy quark limit, and to a study of exclusive semileptonic decays of hadrons. the second lecture is concerned with determinations of the lattice qcd effects, which arise as a result of qcd calculations of charged and neutral current mesons. the main theme of this course is to review the theoretical techniques used to calculate these effects and to extend these calculations into the far - from - equilibrium regime. the materials used in the lectures are based on the theoretical framework introduced in the beautiful review by buras and fleischer, and the unitarity triangles, parity and charge conjugation symmetries, effective hamiltonians and operator product expansions, the heavy quarks effective theory and the heavy - quark phenomenology. in the final lecture, i will review the determination of three generations of quarks and leptons, a subject which has been under continuous study by the experimental community for the next few years. part of this study will be devoted to the investigation whether three quarks are the only ( or the main ) source of @x math0-violation in weak decays, as suggested by a suggestion by wolfensteinenstein. i will also cover the 3 generations of neutral particles and their weak asymmetries and the nature of dark matter. this subject will be the subject of many of the lectures in the series, and i expect that the topics discussed in these lectures will be applied to the hydrogen and helium decays. the hydrogen atom and the light - cone dominated processes will be one of the main topics covered, as well as a simple model for the formation of the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry in the universe. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) ps. 2q_1/ series ] # 1_#1 _ # 1 _ = # 1 1.25 in.125 in.25 in
the nucleosynthesis of the @xmath0-process elements th, eu, and u is investigated in a model of a compact, neutrino - wind proto - neutron star. the main goal is to determine whether or not these elements can be incorporated into the outer atmosphere of the star to obtain a useful lower limit on the minimum age of the universe. the star is assumed to have formed from the fragmentation of a core - collapse supernova remnant at the effective temperature of about 300 k. general relativistic effects are taken into account to specify the final neutron -ino wind velocity field. the energetics of the winds is described by a semi - steady, analytic model taking into account gravitational effects, the dependence of the wind parameters on the neutron - star mass, and the freezeout temperature. the production of the actinide neutron - capture elements u and th, and their relative abundances in the star, are calculated as a function of the stellar rotational temperature and the initial abundance ratio of these elements, to produce a realistic abundance pattern that may be used for age determination. the nucleus - to - nucleus abundance ratio is found to be quite sensitive to the choice of the first two peak in the abundance pattern between the second and third r - process peaks. the most metal - poor star in the universe that is presently known to exhibit such a pattern is cs 31082 - 001, which is an example of an old halo star. analysis of this star has suggested that the age of such an old star can be regarded as a reliable low - mass counterpart of the u - th chronometer pair. the appropriate age determination made in the present paper is then based on fitting a single specific model to the star. in particular, the star was chosen to test the possibility that the recent spectroscopic measurements of the thorium abundance in this star provided by utsunomiya et al. ( 2000 ) have provided conclusive evidence of a slightly underabundant with respect to the solar pattern. we conclude, therefore, that the present - day age of this old star is much greater than that of the sun. # 1eq.

we prove that the bracket induced on the domain of a given skew - adjoint @xmath0-graded total differential operator with involutive image is a part of the bracket - symmetric bracket and thus contributes to the lie algebra structure of the hamiltonian functionals endowed with the poisson bracket. the super - operator in components equals the variational schouten bracket, the latter being defined in terms of the collective commutation closure of the operator. this provides an exact and exhaustive answer on the question whether the algebra of conformally hyperbolic functions superimposed on a bosonic super - field is conformal. as a companion to this paper, we present several results on the geometry and types of super - operators for which the commutation is closed under non - abelian terms, including the case of the korteweg de vries equation. these will be published in the proceedings of the 11th international congress of mathematicians and physicists ( icmp ) in 2005. * introduction * one of the most important problems in the theory of quantum mechanics is the identification of topological structures that are invariant under the action of hamiltonians. for classical sources, this problem can be solved by the green s formula @xcite, which is a powerful tool in the study of gauge invariants and is the general rule for calculating imaginary - time quantum numbers. however, it is more fruitful to study the cases where the operator considered is _ parity - preserving _, that is, the operator is subject to the leibniz rule through the peres - horodecki relation. such situations arise in many interesting problems in quantum field theory. for example, in the context of non - perturbative gauge theory, the jacobi identity provides a simple and very useful criterion on the whether an operator is topologically symmetric or not. a more general test of this statement is available in the special case of quark - gluon condensation, a key issue in the studies of quantum chromodynamics and super - symmetries of the strong and electroweak interactions. the paper is organized as follows. in section [ sec_prelim ], we recall how to formulate the criterion and we also present our main result, theorem 1.**rightarrow pacs : 05.45.+q, 03.65.+a, 05.50.-m, 98.80cq + this paper is addressed to two different readerships. the first is to the reader with elementary familiarity with quantum mechanics and
the young sun is often considered as a possible analog to the sun in its early years. its high - energy radiative activities and magnetic activity are discussed in the context of active stars since it provides information on the radiation environment that determined the properties and chemical composition of the planetary atmospheres of primitive earths. here we focus on the properties of @xmath0 cet, a nearby, very metal - rich young star with a mass very close to solar and a relatively young age ( 0.40.8 gyr ). we analyse its properties in the frame of photodissociation calculations, in order to determine its potential role as a model of the early solar atmosphere. for this purpose we have carried out a spectroscopic study based on high - quality spectra of the young sun and the nearby sun, for the wavelength range of 130 to 200 nm. the star is found to be a quiet star, with a low level of photospheric activity and a weak fe abundance, appropriate for a young star. however, a significant h@xmath1 emission feature is present in all spectral models based on it, indicating a strong contribution from an active star in the ionization and ionization equilibria of the transition region and corona. the measured properties of the star indicate that it may have played a role in the early evolution of earths atmosphere and may have contributed to its relatively high li abundance. we have also investigated the effect of the current sun in a state of evolution when it was about 3.7 gyr ago, at the start of the noachian epoch, by comparing its spectrum with that of the present - day sun. we conclude that the presence of the sun at such a time in the history of earth s atmosphere may have had an impact on the evolution of its atmosphere and on the formation of life on earth.

the moderately populated galactic star cluster ngc 7419 is investigated for the first time using multi - wavelength archival data, in particular, the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ). using the near - infrared color - color diagram and narrow band photometry, we have identified 21 herbig ae / be stars with the masses lying between @xmath0 and 3.0 myr. based on the comparison of x - ray emission properties with those of classical t - tauri stars in taurus - auriga region, we argue that a significant amount of mass segregation takes place in the cluster region. the cluster is heavily reddened in comparison to the ones located at similar distances, and the result of dynamical evolution may be the cause of this difference. the turn - off and the dwarf members of the cluster are found to have ages between 2 and 7 myr, respectively. we have investigated the contribution of the various stellar objects ( ysos ) with the cluster by applying a dust - extinction criterion to the cluster field. almost all of the yso candidates are low mass pre - main - sequence stars. we, therefore, conclude that the biggest effect of yso contamination is on the mass function which determines the duration of star formation. we use the 2mass data to derive the cluster distance. the measured distance is found to be 2.05 kpc, which is slightly larger than the estimated distance of 4.09 kpc from the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) survey. the new cluster parameters derived from xmm - newton data are consistent with the distance estimates based on optical observations ( @xcite ) and with the new ccd ( mosshill et al. ). the current luminosity function ( lf ) of the main sequence cluster members is estimated to range between 1.4 and 1.6 erg s@xmath1. the mean logarithmic slope of the lf is 0.9, which indicates that the cluster members are moderately relaxed. we find that the peak luminosity of the young sos is slightly smaller than that of the older stars. this may be due to the effect of covering up a large area.
we study the asymptotic capacity of a discrete - time periodic model of optical fiber, as the input power tends to infinity. the role of the nonlinearity in point - to - point discrete channels pertains to signal - noise interactions, captured by the conditional entropy. the main result is the following theorem, describing capacity - cost function in models with constant and non - constant loss ; see for example rcl y _ et al_. capacity saturates to a constant @xmath0 in infinite - dimensional models, including the continuous - time model. we discretize in space and time. the standard stochastic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation splits the _ deterministic _ nls equation into linear and nonlinear parts. the latter is solved analytically. the modified nonlinear step in the mssfm model is obtained by discretizing. the spectral coefficient of the linear ( i.e., nonlinear ) step is then determined by averaging over the all - sky field. we show that, the reduced model is equivalent to a unitary multiplexing matrix with fixed probability distribution function ( pdf ), independent of the input signal. the distribution function is the same in the phases and random variables in the spherical coordinate system. we prove that the upper bounds in the pdf do not scale with input power. the model is reduced to a single - user problem for the capacity optimization problem. the capacity is calculated without calculating the conditional pdf of the channel, as it is certainly possible to do so. since there is no need to numerically estimate the capacity, we assume that the task is solved for each channel. in this case, the rate is determined independent of any noise addition. a simple intuition from the awgn, fading and zero - dispersion channels suggests to look at the spatially symmetric ( shannon ) limit. it is shown that shannon capacity in this limit is an upper bound, for any channel, of any rate.
we report the discovery of the optical counterpart of the afterglow of discovered by the magellan / baade 6.5-m telescope on 2008 november 18.15 ut, approximately 2.3 hr after the burst. using near - infrared and optical observations obtained with gemini north and the vlt / ukirt, as well as _ chandra _ x - ray observations, we find a flux of @xmath0 at 0.12 d in the near - ir and optical bands, and a peak flux at 2.2 hr. comparing the observed fluxes to those obtained with previous observations, and using published limits from gemini - north and vlt data, we conclude that the optical /near - ir counterpart of is one of the brightest and most redshifted short - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows detected to date, but is unusually red in the optical band for its optical luminosity, suggesting an origin in a supernova ( sn ), or possibly a compact object merger. spectroscopy of the galaxy within the xrt error circle reveals that it is currently evolving star formation, and is most likely a starburst with an active nucleus at or near - maxima in its innermost regions. the unusually red color, emission from an extended sn, and the detection of a faint optical counterpart are consistent with those expected for a mini - sn, but the emission from a conventional sn is not accounted for in the observed power - law decay model. if the sn emission is due to radiation from a putative nucleus ( e.g., li - paczynski mini - supernova ), and/@xmath1 if an early in the sn phase, then the exponential decay index of the light curve can be used to constrain the redshift of the host galaxy. however, the uncertainty in the location of the burst within the error circle is likely to be significantly larger than the implied by the observed emission. # 1#2#3#1, a&a, # 2, # 3.#1_#2 _ # 1_#3 _ = # 1 1.25 in.125 in.25 in
we report the operation of a getter source loaded with rb vapor. the system cools very rapidly and a rapid turn - off is observed when the source is operated below a threshold value of current @xmath0. we operate the source at source currents in the range of 3.0 to 7.8 a. the rb atoms inside the trap are released at several hundred degrees of temperature. the trap fluorescence is directly related to the number of trapped atoms. we determine a trap lifetime of 13 s and characterize the trap loading and decay properties as a function of source current and pressure. this is important in order to handle rb contamination. we also determine the detuning and magnetic field gradient in an optimal trap system and show that these quantities are consistent with the average value of 5 g / cm. this indicates that this type of trap can be used for optical access to a variety of industrial applications. recently there has been a growing interest in the use of neutral atoms in optical traps @xcite. neutral atoms are used to trap charged atoms and extract their quantum information. in this article, we are concerned with neutral atoms which are trapped in a high density vacuum and have a fairly high temperature ( about 250@xmath1c ). the atoms are rb molecules and their internal density is about one - third of the volume of the trap. the trapping density is determined by a combination of radiation pressure and heat exchange with the atoms. the internal atomic density is measured using a photoemission spectroscopy ( phas ) routine. at low temperatures, the phas results are reproduced by time dependent laser cooling models. at high temperatures, time dependence is seen as well. using phas, one can obtain a result of the order of magnitude higher than that using laser cooling. for example, phas can be achieved with a system like getter, whose turnover timescale is about 1 hour. this system is also very robust and has a well defined threshold current of 2.7 a.l.
we analyze stacked spectra of @xmath0 low - redshift early - type galaxies ( etgs ) from the sdss - based spider survey, and find a systematic trend away from a kroupa / chabrier imf towards a more bottom - heavy imf with increasing central velocity dispersion ( 0.21kms@xmath3 ). two types of imf are considered, a single power - law distribution, generalizing the salpeter law, and a bimodal imf, with a gradual turn - off at low mass, that generalizes the kroupas case. all selected spectral features suggest a variation of the slope of the imf in etgs, towards a higher stellar mass. we confirm this trend with a hybrid approach, where direct spectral fitting in the optical is combined with constraints from imf - sensitive features. the best - fit spectral indices are consistent with state - of - the - art stellar population synthesis models, and can be rejected by their overly high values of the stellar ( relative to dynamical ) mass - to - light ratio. we also explore the correlation of the indices with age, metallicity, and imf. our analysis shows that the low - mass stars can not be distinguished from the high - mass ones solely on the basis of their stellar mass fraction. we find that the combination of the two indices provides the most robust constraint of the whole sample. for unimodal models, the tightest constraints are placed on the initial mass function ( imf ) at late times, i.e. near the solar - scale. however, broad - band optical photometry of etgs provides additional constraints, as a large fraction of m dwarfs can enhance the nir light of a stellar population at low masses, making optical nir colours significantly redder. the range of model colours in the table

detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) is a scaling analysis method commonly used in many research fields for detecting long - range correlations in seemingly non - stationary time series. here we apply dfa to the noisy time series with correlated noise, where the correlation properties of the signal are given by a given scaling exponent @xmath0. we find that in certain good fit region the rms fluctuation function can be approximated by a power - law ( local trend ). we then study the apparent scaling behavior of correlated signals with a linear trend, and find that a crossover between the two is due to the competition of the unbiased random walk and the biased random walk. to this end, we generate correlated time series anticorrelated, white and correlated noise with standard deviation equal to one using the modified fourier filtering method introduced by makse et al. we consider the case when the trend is independent of the local properties ofthe noise ( external trend ), and derive analytically the competition between the noise and the trend to obtain a good fit. we show that the crossover scale depends on : ( i ) the slope of the trend, ( ii ) the length of the correlation exponent, and ( iii ) the ratio of the ` ` classical '' scaling exponent of the noisy signal to its ` ` experimental '' scale. we systematically study all resulting crossovers, their conditions of existence and their typical characteristics associated with the different types of trends. we also show how to use dfa effectively to minimize or even eliminate the effects of those trends in cases that trends are not choices of the study, that is, trends do not reflect the dynamics of the system but are caused by some ` ` irrelevant '' background.
we study the sensitivity of future @xmath0 facilities to the multi - jet background using jet@xmath1 events generated with madgraph5. we find that the predicted cross sections are significantly sensitive to the assumed dark - matter model, especially at high center - of - mass energies where no data is currently available. we calculate 90 % confidence upper limits on the cross sections for a number of possible facilities, including those using the d5 operator. we also consider the next - generation facility, which should be able to produce on - shell mediators through the pairing of dark matter pairs produced through a real #xmath2 mediator. nikhef-2010 - 048 * prediction of limits on + jets + and dark matter * 0.3 cm in a recent publication @xcite, we presented a prediction of the limit on the jet interference cross section at energies near 0.5 tev. the cross section was predicted using the matrix - element approach, and was found to be surprisingly robust and precise. in particular, we were able to match the prediction using the mlm scheme and to extrapolate the prediction to high energies, where data are currently available but are not yet large enough to change the prediction. at the highest collision energies and instantaneous luminosities, the prediction was able to surpass the fermi - lat limit at 1.4 tev, and to extend the prediction into the region where data exist but are still not large enough. the proposed facilities, therefore, have the potential to produce a significant fraction of the dark matter in the form of non - proton events. in this paper, we describe the analysis of these facilities, and make a few predictions for the future. to appear in the _ 7th international astrophysics conference _ + ( 2010 ), + eds. m. seubert et al.

we describe a procedure for recovering the classical primordial power spectrum, @xmath0, of mass fluctuations, i.e., the mass power spectrum of the universe at high redshift, from synthetic qso spectra generated from hydrodynamic simulations of various cosmological models. the method relies on a tight physical relation between the optical depth for absorption and the underlying mass density, a physical property that is marginally consistent with the forest scenario for the origin of primordial fluctuations. we have carried out extensive tests on artificial spectra of qsos generated from simulations of cosmic structure formation, and find that the method successfully recovers ( in normalization ) both the shape and the amplitude of the power spectrum on an interesting range of scales. we apply the method to a single qso spectrum of q1422 + 231, whose spectrum suggests that non - linear gravitational evolution and the resulting smoothing of the spectrum produced by peculiar velocities and thermal broadening have significantly reduced power at large scales. in agreement with the predictions of the fluctuating igm, the simulated spectra generally show a bimodal distribution of power with a power law index of -0.83, in good agreement with observations. because the spectrum probes large scales, our results serve to indicate that the fluctuations in the qso forest arise from fluctuations within a single population, and not from a local burst of fluctuations responsible for the large scale power seen in the spectrum. = = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2>0.51-.500-.5110>1.50-.51 [ 1 ] # 1eq.

we present a publicly available galaxy redshift catalog for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). it contains @xmath0 fields from the sdss imaging survey, and it contains explicit descriptions of the window function on the sky for all of the included surveys. the geometrical information is in the form of a set of spherical polygons, each of which could have been observed by a unique set of tiles. the catalog is small enough ( tens of gbytes ) to easily store on any modern machine, it contains matched catalogs between many major public catalogs of galaxy sizes and redshifts, it is fully aligned with the spatial distribution of sdss targets within a few tenths of an arcsecond ( 10 km s@xmath1 ) and it has a uniform window function. in addition to describing the galaxy distribution within each catalog, the catalog contains a description of the positions and velocities of the sources. in particular, the velocity fields are modeled using the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey. errors in the photometric calibration of the survey have a lower variance and less structure, making the catalog more appropriate for studies of large - scale structure. this paper describes the outline and general principles of the catalog. we show that the catalog can be used to aid in studies of galaxies in low - redshift regions of the study of the local universe. specifically, we use it to : ( i ) estimate the distances to all sdss sources with sdss spectroscopic photometry ; ( ii ) characterize the surface density of galaxies ; ( iii ) study the correlation function and galaxy - galaxy clustering statistics ; ( iv ) estimate of the sample size and redshift ; ( v ) assign rank - ordered weights to galaxies in order of increasing redshift according to the position of the galaxy in the sample. we also include a complete list of 2mass pscgrs - based galaxy catalogs and an extensive catalogue of 2dfgrs. the 2mass - based catalog is included in the current release, and is the only one of the three main releases in which both the selection criteria and the level of completeness have been improved.

we have carried out a high - resolution observing of the pre - main sequence binary system wr 140 with the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) using the hei line at 1.083 @xmath0 m. the star was placed in a near - contact orbit with an o star in a close orbit with a period of 7.9 years. the 2.2-mm orbital motion of the two stars was followed for 10 - 15 months after periastron passage in 2001 june, until 2003 february. in contrast to previous cycles, the flux in the far - infrared region of the binary system varied systematically with orbital separation less than 0.1 %. this flux was higher than in the past for the o star, but lower than for the wc star, which showed stronger emission lines at phases 0.83 - 0.96. the ob stars were on almost circular orbits. the spectra show strong hei absorption with a blue edge at phase 0.21.3, which is not seen in the x - ray images. this is inconsistent with the model predictions of the thin shell model of lhrs and hill, moffat & st - louis ( 2002 ) which attributes the emission to dust formed in the expanding shell of a single wolf - rayet star. we model the rms variation of the emission as arising from clumpy, expanding dust shell with radial velocities varying with orbital motion and find that the observed flux variations are consistent with large variations in the rv of the centre and extent of the dust shell. the radial profile of the absorption, which we interpret as a change in the wind - absorption, shows a steeply rising continuum below 2 kev and a gradual weakening at higher energies, consistent with the behaviour of the underlying stellar continuum. this pre - eclipse eclipse was not triggered by any inhomogeneous, p - cygni absorbed absorption profile as is the case for wr 140.

the transition rate of a quantum system is slowed down by the fact of observing the system. this effect is the quantum equivalent of saying that a watched pot never boils. we call this ` ` super zeno effect '' since one would have to wait an exponentially long time for the system to undergo a transition. there are a variety of noise - induced berry phases which occur due to over - damped spin - dynamics. our recent work has called into question the so - called ` ` irrelevant '' operators in the renormalization group analysis of this effect. we suspected that they summed to give a contribution to the transition rate which was not exponentially small, but instead went like an inverse power of the upper cut - off on the environment spectrum, @xmath0. in this case the berry phase is relatively weakly affected by decoherence and the leading non - adiabatic phase drops out. we present a detailed review of this approach and discuss its regime of validity ( greatly over - estimated in the earlier works ). the same year, bethe noted that atomic hydrogen s levels are slightly shifted with respect to the predictions of schrodinger ( or dirac ) quantum mechanics. this led to a ` ` bloch - redfield '' analysis of the problem, in which the interaction between the electron and photonic excitations of the vacuum is treated in terms of level - repulsion. this transformed hamiltonian ( spin - half coupled to many environment modes ) is used to form a basis of shifted - environment modes. this means one can time - slice on a timescale much less than that associated with the system dynamics, and then average over the noise in each slice. we do not yet know if there is a physical reason behind this cancellation, so the noise does not modify the off - diagonal terms. if the white - noise were generated by an environment of quantum modes, all gaps would be equally represented. however if not, we note that there are well - known counter - intuitive effects which occur under similar conditions.
we develop a practical scheme to study the equatorial motion of test - bodies in axisymmetric - stationary kerr spacetime, sufficiently distant to be detectable by lisa. this scheme is based on the use of a ` quasi - kerr'metric, a metric which deviates only slightly from the well - known kerr equations, while still being able to describe slowly rotating test - bodies. we first derive general canonical perturbation theory equations for the hamilton - jacobi equation which describes any test - body orbiting a kerr black hole. despite the non - separability of the h - j equation, these equations can lead to exact solutions of the exact hamiltonian in the exact kerr metric. we then consider equatorial orbits and compute approximate waveforms for these orbits. these are compared to their kerr analogues by calculating their overlap function in the lisa sensitivity band. we show that the difference in the emitted waveform amplitude translates in a difference between the orbital periastron and the orbital advance. we also show that in a secular sense the motion has three conserved quantities ( apart from @xmath0 ) which is important for the study of wave dynamics. in particular, one is able to first decouple and then separate the dynamical equations thanks to the petrov type-@xmath1 character of the kerr space - time and a suitable choice of coordinate frame. more details on this issue will be presented in a subsequent paper. for the purposes of this paper we focus on the problem of ` confusion'between kerr and quasi- kerr waveforms. as a result of our work we are not able to give a definitive answer to the question of whether these massive objects are kerr holes or not. other candidate massive objects have been proposed ( such as soliton stars, boson stars, gravastars and p - stars ) but these are treated with scepticism by the community as they involve ` exotic'physics. finally, we conjecture that a future gravitational wave detector such as lisa will be able to detect from several to about a thousand ` extreme'mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) during a mission.

the problem of storing cycles of a binary pattern is analyzed in the framework of continuous - time hopfield - type networks. a basic result is that if and only if the discrete fourier transform of the cycle matrix contains exactly @xmath1 nonzero columns, then the cycle is admissible. the question for which cycles the corresponding network connectivity problem admits a solution is also studied. a pseudoinverse learning rule is introduced in order to provide an exact solution. the main objective of this paper is to analyze and classify the structural features of the solution of the admissible cycle, and the topology of the networks constructed from them. in particular, we study whether and how the solution depends on the specific dynamics of the individual neurons and the network constructed from the cycle. a bifurcation analysis reveals that in the case of special simple cycles, the solution is an attracting cycle. for separable composite cycles, a generalized admissible principle is derived, and for each type of cycles a corresponding solution is determined. the network topology is characterized by a feedforward chain with feedback to one neuron if the loop vectors in the network are all cyclic permutations of each other. simulation results showing the successful retrieval of a prescribed cycle are presented. * ams 2000 * * key words and phrases : * neural networks, binarity, chaos, storage. * a main result of this study is the existence and properties of the solutions of ( [ eq : transition01 ] ) along with the structural and network topologies resulting from ( [ equ : fpcond00 ], *??? * ). a key example of that is a network where the neurons form a three - layered structure, which in turn corresponds to an indecomposable invariant subspace of the system.

we study the tree - walls of right - angled buildings, and we especially discuss the case of bourdon s building @xmath2. this is a powerful tool for obtaining information on finite buildings, due to bourdon @xcite. in particular, we obtain information about the finite tree - wall of a building by extending the study of this subject to finite buildings. our study of lattice problems at right angles is inspired by the early work of j. h. eberly, g. s. kabach, and m. kompa on _ lattice geometry _ ( cambridge university press, 2000 ). our aim is to provide an upper bound to the size of a lattice when it is constructed with a finite number of cells. we also hope that this study will help in the construction of a model lattice whose description is stellar. in section 1, we give a brief introduction and discuss the standard procedures for constructing lattice models. to connect this paper with the previous work, we discuss the _ separation property _ of trees. that is, given a locally finite lattice with a ( finite ) family of integers, there is a way to obtain a separation property for the full set of properties, without restrictions having anything to do with the properties of the lattice in question. in subsection 2, we define the separation property and we show some examples of how it can be used in constructing model lattices. section 3.1.2 discusses the general case of trees and the state of affairs. we will discuss some examples below and in section 4.3. for the sake of completeness, in section 5 we compute the counterexamples and conclude our study. a must - include article is included in section 6. it is of interest to understand the intersection of chambers of a complex group, and it is also interesting to show how this intersection relates to a given branch of a tree. the object of the paper is not immediately related to the theory of trees, but we briefly recall how the standard procedure for constructing a tree can be applied to obtain knowledge about lattice spaces.
we investigate the interaction of galactic gas flows with the massive black hole ( bh ) at the center of a galaxy, assuming that the bh grows with the accretion of matter and affects the inflow through feedback. we study the evolution of gas flows in early type galaxies in the presence of a massive bh and of feedback from the agn feedback. the feedback is modeled by varying the rate of accretion into the galactic center, the mass of the central bh, the time elapsed between two successive global degassing events, and the amount of hot gas stored in the central halo gas. the morphology of the evolution is studied in terms of the time evolution of the temperature, mass and luminosity of the hot gas, as well as its temperature and density. we find that the flow evolves through several quasi - static phases, in which the gas remains in a quiescent state for long times ( of the order of gyrs ), as long as the central accretion events are extremely short. at late times the gas in the inner regions of the galaxy is radiatively cooled and the x ray luminosity, after a degassing event, can be large, sometimes up to @xmath0 erg s@xmath1. the total iron content in the galactic ism is found to be well in excess of solar, and so the photoionization model does not provide a satisfactory fit to the data. the case of low efficiency accretion is explored in detail, and we point out that the metal abundances in the icm are likely to be much lower than in the stellar component in most elliptical galaxies. models with an intermediate dark matter halo mass or an optically thick accretion disk are shown to reproduce the observed iron content and the gas properties reasonably well. none of the models can match the observed x ray properties of the galactic halo, in contrast to some recent results from observations. # 1to 0pt#1 _ subject headings _ : galaxies : active galaxies : evolution galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : ism x - rays : galaxies
we study the stellar populations of some distant galaxies based on colours. colours are easier to obtain than spectra and are independent of the distances of objects, therefore they are good candidates for investigating the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies. in particular, colours can be used to estimate the stellar - population parameters of galaxies with small observational errors. in this paper, we studied the age and metallicity sensitivities of colours according to the system parameters, and found that some colours are shown to be sensitive to the ages of young stellar populations ( ysps ). then we complemented our study with a study of colours to those of lick indices to find out if colours can also be used for constraining the metallicities. we found that colours are indeed useful for this purpose, although colours do not allow us to get accurate values of the ages via spectroscopy. however, the distributions of the two parameters are remarkably similar in analysing the same galaxies, especially in early - type galaxies. this means that colours can probably be used more conveniently for the stellar population studies in distant galaxies, as colours are less affected by the effects of young populations in these objects. we also found that the average uncertainties in ages of stellar ages obtained by colours are about 0.02 gyr for old populations ( age @xmath0 4.6 gyr ) and 0.015 dex for young populations ( typically @xcite ). the difference mainly results from the difference between the dominant stellar population of a galaxy and that of a composite stellar population with the same mass. in detail, the colours of some galaxies can help us to quantify the errors induced by the typical dust in these galaxies. when we compared the results determined by photometry with those determined by lick indices, the main results are the following. ( i ) colours can provide us with more reliable ages than colours. the uncertainties in metallicities are typically 0.0001 dex lower than those due to the errors in the colours, but the difference can be reduced by a factor of 2 or more if we use colours with composite stellar populations. ( ii ) the age uncertainties of colours are larger than those from lick indices.

the objective of the present paper is to study the turbulent behavior of nebulae ejected by hot stars, both from high resolution imagery and from the kinematical structure ( via high spatial resolution fabry - perot interferometry ). using the unique, high - resolution, wide field imaging capabilities of hst, we have tested quantitatively the predictions of the governing equations and complex coupling mechanisms for compressible turbulence in the distribution of density clumps in the ejected nebula m1 - 67. on a _ qualitative _ basis, the observations are in agreement with the hypothesis that pre - existing turbulence ( or any other process of fragmentation, hence variability ) already arose in the winds _ themselves _ before they interacted. having established the conditions for the existence of intermittency in the flows, we will search through the calculation of the moments of the density / velocity increments for different orders ( _ i.e. _ the first order multifractal transition ). this is the first attempt to use the second order structure function, as is generally the case in other studies, to constrain the physically relevant parameters of the stellar wind model. + turbulence is characterized by a high degree of non - linearity ( involved in the thermodynamical behavior of the flows ), which leads to a variety of physical / transport processes occuring over a great range of scale lengths. among these, bulk energy flows seem to be most related to motions of the inflow filaments aiming to exit the nebula. what is interesting is that these filaments also exhibit a similar scaling behavior as turbulence, namely that their energy spectra broaden in a way that continuously broadens the spectrum to include smaller and smaller scales. this means that the presence of turbulence is a generic feature of the flow structure. as a result of the scaling laws, the density structure of m1- 67 appears to be largely symmetric around its mean ( down to about @xmath0 ) velocity and pressure directions. in other words, m 1 - 67 exhibits a sign for _ universal _ turbulent clumping. this fact is in line with the inference of previous studies that the turbulence of the ejected winds may be related to a previous, luminous blue variable wind from the wr star wr124. however, it may also be a consequence of some other hydrodynamical instabilities which are not related to the current nebula it ejects. further studies are, however, obviously needed to determine the precise geometry of the colliding winds and to establish the exact statistical nature of the observed turbulence.
we present a primitive variable star catalogue for the andromeda galaxy m31. this catalogue is based on lightcurves of 35414 variable stars from the point - agape survey, which have been extracted from a @xmath0-band image of m31 obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the 8.2 m _ hubble space telescope ( hst )_. we find 12 novae in the m31 field of view, of which 7 are associated with microlensing events. two of these novae lie within the fields mapped in the wfc images. the seventh nova is associated with a x - ray source. in addition, we have discovered another nova ( cxom31 j004318.4 + 410950 ) that lies along the same path as one of the novae reported by crotts et al. ( 2004 ). this nova turns out to be the fastest nova in m31, and is possibly the most energetic nova known. it has a rapid spin - up time scale and a low optical depth, which may be caused by dust in the foreground galaxy. we determine its position in the halo and find that it is very close to the position of a point source reported by kaaret ( 2002 ). the photometric redshift and the redshift of this point source indicate that it may be a low - luminosity agn. we construct a model lightcurve for the individual stars and examine the asymmetry in the variable star distribution as a function of apparent brightness and period. we find that all the variable stars are asymmetric in the sense that the far - side ( or south - east ) side of the major axis is brighter and has more detected objects than the near - side side. this is caused primarily by the effects of variable extinction and the prominent dust lanes associated with the spiral structure. the data are consistent with theoretical models that predict that the lensing population associated with m31 is a well - mixed stellar population with a low density component. we conclude that there is no unambiguous evidence for a lens in the dark halo, as it is difficult to disentangle effects of lensing with the stellar population from those caused by the stellar populations in the near disk and spheroid.

we provide a framework for the quantitative analysis of stochastic real - time systems, that is, markov chains with continuous state - space. to do so, we generalize several notions of decisiveness, of fairness and of attractors, and end up with defining deterministic muller automata, and other properties. this allows us to derive decidability and approximability results for the verification of those models. as a special case, we define a notion of abstraction, which makes sense for stss. concepts of soundness and completeness are naturally defined for those abstractions, and general transfer properties are given, which will be central to several verification algorithms on stns. measures and other notions are extended in a straightforward way from stss to lstss. @xmath0-regularity is a standard notion in computer science to characterise simple properties. it reduces to the qualitative problem for near - sure executeable inputs, and the problem for a model that is almost sure to be reachable with high probability. in the model - checking context, it is often a hard problem, particularly for infinite - state models. the problem can be reduced to a problem of approximation for a small class of possible states of the system, which is formulated in terms of periodic measurable events. under certain general assumptions, we prove that these approximation schemes are guaranteed to terminate for any given precision. to deal with the latter condition, we design an approximation scheme for the _ repeated _ reachability properties of a concrete model, inspired by the path enumeration algorithm of purdulla, ben henda and mayr. we further refine the concept of muller and bchi, and establish a correspondence between them by dchi and muller - dchi. this leads us to define a probability measure, on which we evaluate the approximate value of the reached - out property. this probability measure is the product of two estimators, the durant and the summatory part. under the assumption that the potential of the method is not infinite, we compute the standard muller distribution for the reachability property. finally, for those models which enjoy some good effectiveness properties, we propose an approximation algorithm for the full ( repeated ) check of those properties, and also design a framework to analyse their dynamical properties.
the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonian of an open many - body system coupled weakly to the continuum are studied. the ratio between the lifetimes of the long - lived and the short - lived states is found to approach zero near avoided crossings in the complex plane. this means that, as a result of the interplay between the two types of forces, the structure of the wavefunctions of the resonance states of the closed system is mixed permanently with those of the continuum states. the coupling matrix elements of the system are found to play a dominant role in this scenario. permanent changes in the wavefunction structure are traced at the avoided crossings as a function of the coupling strength between the leads of the resonator and the waveguide. the forms of these permanent changes are not specific to the system studied. they are, however, generic to all the cases considered so far studied in the context of open quantum systems with discrete states : they are all related to the presence of the discrete states via the interaction @xmath0 with the continuum of decay channels. the avoided level crossings lead, in some cases, to temporary and, in other times, to permanent changes of their structure. the relation between these two level - crossings and the behavior of the eigenfunctions is analyzed in detail. the pulses of the post - avoided resonance crossing electrons can be seen as the motion of the poles and the widths of the channels corresponding to the first transversal mode in the lead. the quantum dynamics of these states is traced. as a consequence of the generalization of closed quantum systems, the region of avoided resonance crossings where two or more resonance states start to overlap is characterized by the formation of a bifurcation, i.e. a mixing of the states. this mixing is not caused by the effects of two - body forces, but by the interaction among the states due to the mutual influence of the detected states in the critical region around the first level repulsion and to the second one via the above - mentioned avoided level crossing. the complete characterization in the framework of the random matrix theory is proposed. it is shown that the principal value integral and the residuum model for a closed system can be solved exactly. in this case, the physical picture obtained in this paper is in good agreement with the picture obtained from the recent works @xcite.
we combine data from an ultra - deep and homogeneous radio ( 1.4ghz ) survey ( the phoenix deep survey ) with existing @xmath0jy radio observations in the 0.52kev soft and hard bands to study the mean x - ray properties of sub - millijansky ( sub - mjy ) radio galaxies. the aim of this paper is to explore the influence of agn and star - forming galaxies on the spectral properties of radio selected subsamples of radio sources at low and high redshifts. we use a 50ks xmm-_newton _ pointing with a 20 resolution pointing to a subregion of a deep contiguous radio survey with @xcite. multiwavelength data are available for this field and we use the existing broad - band photometry, ultraviolet ( uv, optical ) spectroscopy and narrow emission line ratios ( i.e. the combination of optical and nir ) to estimate photometric re - fluxes and spectral types for all radio sources brighter than 0.1mag ( a subsample of 82 ). we investigate the optical properties of 65 e / s0 radio sources exhibiting spiral galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and 17 radio sources with elliptical best - fit seds. we find the optical counterparts of the majority of these ( 82 out of 106 ) to be faint radio sources. a small number ( 10 out of 31 ) of these faint sources show spectroscopic evidence for seyfert-1 or 2 type activity. stacking analysis is used to separate radio sources from agn - candidates in each redshift bin. for the subsample with known redshift, we find that the probability of finding agn correlated systems is 3.9 per cent for sources with spiral / irregular seds and 1.7per cent for those with irregulars. we have also studied the possibility of including sources that are unresolved in the hard ( or low ) band and find no significant evidence for this type of system to provide an upper limit on the average flux density of extragalactic objects. we conclude that it is unlikely that most of the sources studied here are starbursts. instead the likely future radio sources are likely to be galaxies actively forming in the starburst regime. for sources without optical counterparts the soft - band upper limits translate into upper limits to the star - formation rate density of the local ( or distant ) population of galaxies consistent with previous studies. galaxies : starburst galaxies : evolution x - rays : galaxies : galaxies
we discuss a method for characterizing the point spread function ( psf ) of a natural guide star ( ngs ) guided by a laser guide star. the method is based on an observation of a dense star field with a high - order kernel kernel map " which is combined with on - axis psf information. we apply this kernel map to data obtained with the shane telescope at lick observatory. the resulting psf map " is compared to a previous one, also using a semiempirical technique, but with one important improvement. the tip - tilt guide star in the ngs is not directly visible in the image, but the extra information from the kernel map is presented in an appendix. the field dependence of the psf is investigated analytically, with simulations using a software package which is similar to that which we gave in an introduction to the program. the simulations show that the method can be used to improve the accuracy of psf characterization in star - field observations. we also describe a second astrophysical observation, where we use the same kernel map but use a different telescope and a different observing strategy. this yields an improved psf determination for the target star field of 8.020 arcmin@xmath0, with an accuracy of 67 %. however, because of the angle of the laser spot " with respect to the guide star, the derived ngs psf differs from the one based on the non - pointing - on observation, and so we also find this technique would result in an improvement in astrometry, which is important for high - resolution astrophysics. a problem with the new method is that the effect of anisoplanatism is only small for high zernike orders, such as @xmath1. the effect is larger when the guidestar is closer to the observer, for example for stars as close as 1 away. it is unclear, however, how important the effect will be for ngs observations. the technique presented in this paper is not applicable directly to lgs observations because the optical configurations of lgs and ngs are different. semianalytical methods are not applicable because the seeing angles of the guide stars change significantly over the course of a scientific observation.
we examine the initial development of an accretion structure around a neutron star which is encountering an external medium. in a first set of simulations, we compute the evolution of a series of free - fall conditions over a range of initial conditions ( entropy, chemical composition, and infall rate ). these conditions typify the initial structure which can be expected for an initially weakly gravitationally bound neutron star. as the star plows through an ambient medium, more and more material is accreted within its infall radius and begins forming an oblate shock. we examine just such atmospheres where the entropy is stably stentive, i.e., the density at the bottom of the atmosphere is less than the one - fourth power. in this work, we concentrate on the most extreme atmospheres. by comparing our results to the observations of high - energy x - ray binaries, we find that the brunt - visla frequency in these systems is an order of magnitude higher than in the case of the canonical bondi - hoyle infall, indicating that the effects of neutrino processes on accretion are significant. in addition, we have found that our atmospheres are subject to convection while the accretion rate is high, which can lead to infall rates which are near the high - mass limit ( @xmath0 y@xmath1 ). from this result, we predict the existence of a population of low - entropy atmospheres with negative entropy gradients throughout the inner region of the star. due to the absence of secular secular changes in the chemical composition of these atmospheres, there is a lower limit to the entropy through which mixing can occur. since the effectiveness of convection is not determined by the infall rate, we define a subset of unstable atmospheres in which convection can no longer be induced by infall rate. using this subset, we demonstrate that massive star - forming systems are driven to collapse in supernova explosions owing to the combined effect of infall rate and entropy. we conclude that these conclusions hold for a wide range of atmospheres and many different assumptions. # 1to 0pt#1 _ subject headings _ : accretion, accretion disks supernovae : general stars : neutron.
we prove that the non - negative eisenstein functions acting on hyperbolic manifolds with cusps are invariant under the following transformation from a group of isometries on the space of linear forms to the group of jets. a group @xmath0 is called _ polar _ if its pullback scalar is positive. we study the _ regularity _ of the pull - back scalar coefficients acting on _ strong _ and _ weak _ stable and _ unstable _ jacobi fields along a jet, and on certain horospheres, we prove that they are continuous under the variation of the metric. in addition, we show that the marked set of scattered geodesics is continuous along the jet.

the bullet cluster was observed by in two epochs, for a cumulative 266 ks of conservatively - cleaned exposure time. the energy - dependent morphology of the spectrum is consistent with the extrapolation of projected temperature maps obtained with and. the observations place an upper limit on the inverse compton ( ic ) flux of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 ( 50100 kev ). this flux is significantly below the 3.6 kev flux of the bullet cluster, and is inconsistent with previous measurements of ic emission associated with galaxy clusters. we construct an empirical, spatial - spectral model of the background and apply it to our observations to derive a ` ` most '' spectral spectrum for the region containing cluster emission. after evaluating the important systematic uncertainties, we find that the spectrum can best be characterized with a pure thermal model, or a significant ic component at the highest detectable energies ( t+ic ). in both cases, the data alone prefer the second model, and reasonable values are obtained for both temperatures in the former. we can not rule out an ic flux within the range of fluxes in the, however, the non - thermal component is marginal in both the data and the radio observations. it is clear that the ic component is important but not the dominant component in the data. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) ps. 2q_1 1_1 # 1[#1 ] # 1*#2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 r^2 d_1 r_1 s_2 e_l e_r e_b m_z m_w _ _ w _ w zb| ( # 1, # 2 ) rz lee + _ r. arcidiacono, g. bocquet, n. cabibbo, a. ceccucci, d. cundy, v. falaleev, m. fidecaro,, l. gatignon,, r. erriquez, and j.w. young + _ astrophysical research group, university of minnesota, minneapolis, mn 55455 _
the two - dimensional ising model is a well - known paradigmatic model for strongly correlated spins. it models clusters of spins in liquid crystals, where the degrees of freedom of the spins are maximized by the interaction with a laser field. niedermayer proposed a monte carlo algorithm for simulating this model at the critical point, which has been widely used for simulations of other spin models. in this paper we look at a parallel implementation of the wolff algorithm which simulates the entire lattice of spins by making ` ` links '' with probability @xmath0 between the spins in the cluster and points towards the same direction as the spins pointing in the other direction. we prove a new result relating the durations of the links to the mean size of the clusters, found to be analogous to the behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility, and derive an accurate value of the dynamic exponent of the algorithm. we also compare the results obtained by the proposed algorithm with those obtained using a metropolis algorithm, another non - local update move. it turns out that the times of the cluster flips can be related to the correlation lengths of the nodes, and therefore to the critical exponents characterizing the model. in the presence of a magnetic field we find that the dimension of the intermediate states is strongly correlated, and we study how the properties of the model depend on the degree of correlation of the neighbour spins. 2 the ising spin model is one of the most important models in strongly correlated physics, and has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ). despite its long history, there are still many open problems concerning the simulation of this model. one of them is the apparent difficulty in moving the spins from the cluster centre to other clusters and vice versa. the other is the general problem of relating the spins to the environment, namely, given a system of spins which are spatially separated by a certain amount, but which are related in a certain way to the surrounding lattice, it is not clear to what extent we can depend on this property. the aim of this paper is to show that the answer to this problem is well understood in terms of the so - called ` ` cluster flippability '', i.e. the fact that the time taken to complete one monte - carlo step of equation ( that is, to update the volume of the system ) is proportional to the number of spins of that system, and hence to the size of that cluster. cluster
we present the first results from our survey of massive stars in m31 and m33. these data were obtained with the mosaic ccd cameras on the kpno and ctio 4-m telescopes at the magellan national observatory. the aim is to characterize the stellar content of the two local group galaxies, to determine their metallicity, and to use these data to test and fine - tune " stellar evolution models. we determine zero - points and line - of - sight extinction ratios for the stars in each galaxy, and also constrain the population of red supergiants ( rsgs ). the m31 data include _ ubvri _ data, while the m33 data include only _ hst _ acs images and narrow - band ( 50 - 80 ) photometry. data are presented in two separate papers, and a catalog is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3484v1. m31 contains 1,781 lbv stars, with a median of 1.8 lbv ; the median of the lbv in m33 is 146 lbv. the integrated escape luminosity of luminous stars from the two galaxies is @xmath0 l@xmath1. for the first time, we can compare m31 with the milky way for nearly a million years. we find that the masses are similar, and that the metallicities are nearly identical, but with a spread of nearly 40 %. we also use color - magnitude diagrams to determine the distribution of wolf - rayet stars and rsgs, and find that there are large differences, on the basis of the apparent luminosity - distribution, between the two groups. these large differences suggest that the rsgs may have a different evolutionary history than the wrs. we confirm two stars that have been identified as rsgs and are located at the wrong ascension : ob48 - 444, which is an early b - type supergiant, and v10.5 - 231. we suggest future follow - up studies of these stars, and discuss the advantages of large area photometry over spectroscopy.
we study the minimization of a nonconvex objective @xmath0 consisting of a quadratic data fidelity term and a weighted penalty defined parameter weighted by a nontrivial scalar parameter@xmath1. we provide a detailed analysis and provide an easy - to - use criterion to select a _ strict _ ( local ) minimizer of the objective. the criteria for the selection of the local minimizer are exhibited and analyzed. we prove that the ( local and global ) minimizers of a regularized objective with the provably best possible regularization parameter,, are all linear in data @xma0. the uniqueness of the global minimizer is established and verified. under very mild conditions, it is shown to be strict. the parameter choice problem is investigated for several applications : estimation of the mean value of a parameter from data corrupted with gaussian i.i.d. noise, the reconstruction of 3d tomographic images from a wavelet frame, and the analysis of sparse residual data in a multi - level logistic model. among other examples, we consider the following : identification of global minimizers and their statistics in markov random fields beyond a closed negligible subset. we show that the chance that a truly random search fails to yield a statistically meaningful estimate of the potts prior model parameter, when the submatrix has full column rank, improves significantly with respect to the case of a single nonlocal minimizer. consequently, the ability of this tool to select the target objective in very mild cases can be utilized for subset selection problems. the percolation theorem tells us that the probability that a _ local _ minimizer ( ) of a random objective achieves a statistically significant reduction in rank fails to be less than a _ strictly _ constant - random search function. we illustrate the main results of the paper with numerical tests. even though overlooked for several decades, the intrinsic difficulty of minimizing objective constraints is at the heart of many applications.

the evolution of an epidemic process on a heterogeneous substrate turns out to be more complex than previously believed. in fact, two different subsets of vertices ( either the hub or the innermost core of the network ) can take the role of ` ` super - spreaders '' of the epidemic process and this role must be played by the maximum of the infected vertices for any value of the spreading rate. on the other hand, in processes allowing an endemic steady - state this picture can be however modified by the presence of strong degree correlations, which can shift the weight towards one or the other mechanism. our study calls for further theoretical research on strongly correlated networks. * how to effectively control an epidemic has attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite. in one case these studies aim at identifying the mechanism by which an epidemic spreads through a network. in the other cases, like the one discussed in this article, the purpose of this work is to clarify the different mechanisms and we conclude that the sir model is not able to successfully predict an epidemic threshold, whatever its connection to the underlying network. to achieve this goal, we first discuss the sis process on uncorrelated scale - free networks and then apply this to three real networks : the internet map at the autonomous system ( as ), the social network of pretty - good - privacy ( pgp ), and the network of actors co - starring in hollywood movies ( movies ). we, first, investigate the process of sis spreading on the scale of the whole network, taking into account the effect of the vertices of high degree, showing that the transition occurs simultaneously for the maximum @xmath0 and the whole system, while the star - graph centered around the hub remains inactive. in another case, we show the opposite, and it is the hub which is the main activter of the system. our results, confirmed by the analysis of numerical simulations, show that the activation mechanisms play different roles for the different networks : in the as network, an active state is triggered by the hub, while in the pgp network, the maximum is activated by the network s other nodes, which make the hub and the maximum joint. moreover, our results also show a mixing of activation mechanisms for the as networks, instead of the case of pgp networks. this fact is confirmed for the movies and bars networks, where strong disassortative correlations reduce the interconnections of high - degree vertices and thus suppress in this way the index of the maximum. in these two cases,
in weakly ionized gas, tiny grains are important charge carriers and affect the non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) effects via ohmic conductivity, hall effect, and ambipolar diffusion. we study the role of tiny grains in driving magnetorotational instability ( mri ) driven accretion in protoplanetary disks ( ppds ), and find novel behaviors occur when agn grains are abundant ( despite whether larger grains are present or not ). at the inner disk where accretion is layered, the predicted @xmath0 is one to two orders of magnitude lower than in the grain - free case due to increased ohmic resistivity, but is similar to or higher than that with solar - abundance #xmath1 grains. the increase in the predicted accretion rate occurs at the transition radius where the disk midplane flares, and the ohmic resistor becomes active, making grain coagulation and fragmentation irrelevant to the mri. quite unexpectedly, we find that tiny grains make mri - induced accretion even more rapid than the case without tiny grains. our results highlight the importance of adsorption of pah grains on the disk. * according to the ad nature model, electrons and ions are the only charged species in a gas at a given temperature, and neutral particles are the main charge carriers. when the density of the neutral particles increases, the electron number density is reduced, resulting in the increase of the ionization fraction and the hall diffusivity. however, the amount of electron ionization depends strongly on the magnetic field strength, with positively charged species contributing more to the mass budget in the gas than negatively charged species. in tenuous regions, ohmic effect dominates even when the hall parameter lies in between. grains, which are well known for enhancing the electron recombination rate, strongly affect the mhd effects. in six out of ten regions with strong magnetic field, the distributed grains contribute to significantly increase the local ohmic resistance compared to the neutral grains, with the magnitude of the increase depending on the grain abundance. beyond the extent of this increase, ad - dominated regions are strongly damped. *
we present a simple gasdynamic modelization of the x - ray emitting plasma in galaxy clusters subjected to the action of radiative processes only. we assume gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a potential well formed by a nfw dark matter halo and a de vaucouleurs profile representing the central galaxy. the initial temperature profile should represent a reasonable initial condition to study the radiative evolution of the cluster cores. we briefly discuss how the results depend on the choice of the initial conditions. we present results for two cluster models : a ` ` hot '', massive cluster with a virial dark matter mass @xmath0 m@xmath1, and an ` ` 8 kev '', low - redshift clump with a mass distribution as seen in the data available at _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _. in both models, we identify a cooling core in formation and not fully developed. the core temperature, density, entropy and surface brightness profiles are all strongly correlated with the age of the structure, being older structures the ones with the lower cooling time at given radius. a comparison with the observational constraints is beyond the goal of the paper. however, our results are significant, with a predicted rise of 78 ( 54 ) and 161 ( 126 ) per cent in the hot ( cool ) and cool ( hot ) systems, respectively, during a period of 10 gyr. we predict a variation by a factor of 3 in the inner regions of massive systems and a corresponding steepening of the slope of the surface brightness profile beyond the cooling radius. the predicted ratio between the outer and total temperature ranges between 1 and 1.2 as actually observed, the contribution of the outer region to the total luminosity is expected from the models to be larger than 0.6 at any age, whereas the observed ratios reach values around 0.4.

we investigate the properties of stellar winds from possible generations of very massive stars at very low metallicities, in the range from 100 to 300 m@xmath0 solar, as inferred from observations of o - stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds. little is known so far about the effects of winds at such low metallicity on the evolution of massive stars, mainly because of the very high effective temperatures needed to achieve radiative line driving. using a new concept to describe line driven winds with depth dependent force multipliers, which allows for a systematic treatment of the radiative acceleration, we develop a fast algorithm to calculate stellar wind structures and mass - loss rates from the equation of motion. we apply the algorithm to a new set of oii wind models with synthetic stellar masses and metallicities and we investigate the principal influence of these winds on ionizing fluxes and observable ultraviolet spectra. to test the efficiency of the algorithm we have applied it to four different stellar parameters : the stellar mass, the effective temperature, the strength of the photospheric photon momentum and the wind velocity. we have investigated the effect of different stellar wind strengths and different distances to the eddington - limit by using full stellar wind equations and a grid of wind models at constant luminosity and effective temperature. the results suggest that stellar winds have a significant impact on the ionization history of the intergalactic medium and on the spectroscopic properties of galaxies through the analysis of broad absorption lines in the integrated spectra of starforming galaxies. simple analytical fits to the stellar wind formulae provide quantitative estimates of the strengths of wind features and wind energies as a function of stellar parameters. we found that line - driven winds are strongest for stellar masses up to about 0.1 solar and stronger for stars with lower metallicities ( solar and above ). wind energies calculated for solar - type stars are significantly smaller than observed and they are consistent with the predictions of ionization models of wolf - rayet stars at similar to those in the solar neighborhood. for extremely metal - poor stars with solar - like mass, we were able to disentangle the net effect of wind blocking and neutral hydrogen blocking in the ionizing and observed fluxes. we had found that the majority of lines come from line - forming stars and that the amount of ionizing photons from these stars is reduced through line - driving. the effects were found to be different for the solar and very metal poor stars. in particular, for the two most massive stars in our galaxy, where the met
the propagation of an electromagnetic field in the paraxial approximation is described by the same wave equation as the quantum time evolution. the quadratic phase factor can be represented as a finite fourier sum, with certain coefficients in the presence of feedback. we will derive a compact summation formula for the propagation of the wigner function at rational multiples of the talbot distance, describing the main features of the fourier images of the field. a detailed discussion of the fractional talbot effect can be found in ref. [ arxiv:1112.3403 ]. fresnel diffraction is described in terms of a one dimensional fresnel grating. the complex structure of the fresnel images is, however, evidence for a complicated interplay between different phases of the interference terms between the source wave and the entangled fourier components. in this paper, we demonstrate that the falpella effect, commonly observed in ultracold atom diffraction, can also be understood as an interference between components shifted in the position space by fractions of the pattern period. we propose a general theory for the interpretation of these interference terms, which can be extended to the case of wave packets. as a byproduct, we will obtain a summation representation of the elliptic flow of a fresnel image, valid for arbitrary talbot distances. the corresponding equation for the eigenstates of the projected wave function is also derived. it can be used to perform approximate eigenvalue calculations for wave packets dynamics. the model which is proposed to describe this effect consists of a superposition of copies of the initial state generated by a simple transformation. in the process, the wave packets acquire additional phase shifts. a close analogy between the dynamics of the wave packet dynamics and the quantum fractional revivals in the infinite square well is revealed, as well as a common feature of the dynamical phase factors, which are a characteristic feature of many nonlinear systems.
we study a model of forced harmonic oscillator embedded in a @xmath0 dimensional noncommutative spacetime in the special relativistic limit. the oscillator is assumed to be formed by elements of a doubly / deformed special relativity ( dsr ) theory. we show that the transformation of the dsr algebra into a lorentz algebra at the origin has a profound effect on the thermodynamics of the model. in particular, the modified dispersion relation and the dispersion corrections to the planck length and energy are found to be in contradiction with poincar invariance. we also study the consequences of the modification of the equation of state for a loop system which contains a black hole, a white dwarf and a pair of white dwarfs. the physics is appreciably richer in the latter case. -.6 in -0.8 in # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

we present an inventory of ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption line observations of ions in the local interstellar medium ( lism ) in the spectral range 1200 - 1800. these observations are the basis for a comprehensive analysis of many of the physical properties of the lism, including : the morphology, small scale structure, ionization structure, and the degree of ionization and depletion of ions. this work expands our previous inventory of lism absorption observations @xcite, which included only stars with high ( @xmath0 ) resolution spectra ( e.g. ghrs or stis ). good spatial coverage of the sky and of objects at various distances is crucial to understanding the morphology and turbulent velocity structure in our local environment. we take advantage of the known kinematic structure along a line of sight, obtained from high resolution absorption lines to measure the total interstellar component ( ion ). we use the line profiles to fit the central velocity to the spectra of the ions, and determine the accuracy of the fits provided that ( 1 ) all of the observed ions sample the same collection of gas, and ( 2 ) the errors are small compared to the uncertainties in comparing observations obtained with different spectrographs and observed with the stis instruments. by comparing the measured absorption velocities of the resonance lines of,, and to the available spectra for other ions, we determine abundances for particular ions. the derived abundances include : the fine structure doublet and 1215.3376, the triplet at 1199.5496, 1200.2233, and 1200.7098, at 1302.1685, at 1670.7874, and five resonance lines at 1190.4158, 1193.2897, 1260.4221, 1304.3702, and 1526.7066. we also compare the column densities ( ) of the various ions with the range of atomic masses of known. the inability to determine the velocity centroids for individual ions, given the current knowledge of ion kinematics, suggests that the involved ions are not significantly larger than the local molecular cloud. this study and the others in this series will be published in subsequent papers of this series.
we present a study of the inner gas distributions in the nearby radio galaxy ngc 4335 using hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfpc2 broad- and narrow - band imaging, hst / stis narrow- and broad - band spectroscopy, and ground - based stis optical / near - ir stellar absorption - line observations. we find that the gas kinematics are consistent with being in a rotating circular disk with a thin ( @xmath0 ) disk surface brightness profile. this model provides a reasonable fit to the gas mean velocities and dispersions, the dust disk morphology and gas disk mass distributions ( pa ). the ratio of the gas velocity to the stellar velocity dispersion estimates the black hole ( bh ) mass and the mass - to - light ratio, using gas dynamical modeling and independent methods. the bh mass is inferred from two - integral modeling assuming a thin disk, but the uncertainties involved in modeling are too large to prove conclusively that the model is valid. the thin disk model is also consistent with the data if the excess ` velocity'dispersion is due to gravitationally - induced turbulence. the mean - velocity profiles are smooth functions of position and are indicative of rotation in a gas disk with additional turbulent motion. the disk inclination and position angle are well - constrained by the data. independent methods can not account for the velocity shift, which is at least 2 kpc from the nucleus, if the gas is in a regular rotating disk. the steeply falling gas disk model does not fit the observed central flux profile, implying that a more spheroidal distribution is preferred, at least near the nucleus. the combined constraints from stellar and gaseous ( i.e., deconvolved and de - inclined ) fluxes are enough to constrain the intrinsic disk velocity distribution. we use the co - added line - of - sight velocity probability density function ( vp ) and the best - fit power - law relation between the central velocity and the gas surface brightness for a gaussian distribution. the comparison of the observed vp and the predicted vp for any given observation of the same galaxy supports the idea that there is no significant correlation between jet mass and jet power or vp, while the slope of the distribution of central velocity measurements agrees well with the distribution inferred from stellar isophotes. we discuss the implications of the results in the context of black hole mass measurements.
the carina nebula is an ideal laboratory for comprehensive multiwavelength studies of an environment where young protoplanetary disks are bombarded by supernova ejecta. it is known to contain a significant population of second - generation stars, but the nature of this second generation has not yet been determined through detailed imaging of the region. here we present observations covering the major axis of the nebula at radio, near - ir, and optical wavelengths, as well as optical and near - infrared images from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( msx ). the integrated 3.4 cm radio continuum flux of carina, obtained with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ), is an excellent tracer of the diffuse 20 - 25 @xmath0 m emission from warm dust mixed with ionized gas inside giant h ii regions. this warm dust accounts for about 1/3 of the total far - ir luminosity, but contains only a small fraction of the cold dust mass. the presence of cooler dust at 3040 k in the interior of the h ii region, inferred from millimeter - wave tracers, leads us to conclude that the total dust mass in carina is less than half the total ionizing photon luminosity. however, the relative contribution from this cool dust mass fraction is difficult to quantify, because 5060 % of the known stellar population is still in the form of dust. from the integrated h@xmath1 luminosity as a diagnostic of the ionizing flux, we infer a total lyman continuum ( 6.9@xcite ) luminosity of q@xirk ( pah ) = 2.4@xoggioshard ( 2@xcitation.cl ) = 3.1(1.2)ieuv. the pah band - e emission from the region is characterized by a spectrum that is well - described by a single power - law, with a photon index of 2.8, and a 0.932@xwwwxmath2 conversion efficiency of 0.555. we find an excellent spatial correlation between the distribution of the radio continuum and the 21.3-band continuum from msx observations. this provides spatially - resolved evidence that the radio emission is dominated by hot dust located in the south pillars of carretta - nae and is being overrun by the advancing stellar winds and uv radiation from the second generation of stars. we measure the total kinetic energy budget of
the inner radio and optical jets in m87 are dominated by the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability, which produces a pair of twisted emission filaments, and is the dominant source of radio, optical, near - ultraviolet and x - ray emission in the m87 jet. we show that the observed morphology of these filaments is consistent with a model in which the dual, helically twisted filaments in the inner jet are caused by the kh instability. we base our model on the qualitative similarity between the observed filaments and the development we first used to develop baseline, steady - state jet models. we then carried out a kh instability analysis of the baseline models. because our kh analysis requires a model of the jet flow speed as well as the speed of the wave pattern within the jet, we parameterize our jet models to describe the extent to which energy flux is conserved in the flow. we find that the elliptical surface mode in our model jet is close to resonance, and matches the observed flow deceleration. we also verify that the growth rate of the mode is sufficient rapid to saturate along the jet. however, our model does not describe the true jet structure clearly. we create a pseudo - synchrotron image of the kh mode in a representative model jet, and find that it is significantly different from the observed intensity structure of the real jet. the image shows that the jet flows faster and the filamentary emission is more complex. the reason for this difference is that the radio - loud plasma from the jet is interacting, and probably mixing, with the thermal ism. _ we determine what conditions must be in place in the jet and cocoon in order to match the observed features in the kh modes created by the instability, and determine that these conditions are @xmath0 times denser and cooler than the surrounding ism, but still quite hot compared to the galactic interstellar medium. _ the cocoon is surrounded by a hot ` ` cocoon '', which must be ten times more hot and denser than the jet plasma. the filaments observed by lobanov, hardee & eilek ( 2003 ), are consistent with this cocoon plasmas.
we present numerical simulations of the core - collapse and post - bounce evolution of a 15@xmath0 supernova remnant. the model consists of a lattimer & swesty equation of state for the stellar interior, a nonrelativistic hydrodynamics scheme that incorporates for the first time the full propagation of neutrinos in a fully self - consistent manner around a star, and accurate hydrostatic equilibrium in the decoupling layer. we perform our simulations in two dimensions using the prometheus - vertex code. comparison with non - exploding spherically symmetric simulations indicates that the neutrino - heating mechanism is crucial for the development of the explosion in this case, in particular for the suppression of the low - mode silicon absorption instability ( sasi ) around the neutron star. the importance of the presence of sasi oscillations for the blast development was also evidenced by a comparison of results for models with the same input physics but with different lateral grid resolutions. in the 2d simulations we find that the acoustic energy input to the explosion is negligible compared to the total amount of energy ( about @xmath1ms ) needed to pump the gas out of the star. as a consequence, the resulting blast was unable to produce any significant convective overturn ( convective revival ) of the stalled shock. however, buras et al. ( 2006 ) found that such a rotation - driven shock was able to produce a detectablenz explosion in the main sequence case ( m15s7b2 ). in this work we present evidence that the same mechanism might be at work in the multi - dimensional simulations presented here. we argue that the sasi can be expected to play a crucial role in the explosion process in cases of more massive progenitors if the separation of the shock front from the accretion bubble is sufficiently large. explosions of this type are likely to be characterized by large timesteps of the g - mode flux oscillations that were found in the more massive models of mayle & wilson ( 1988 ) and by the shallow density gradient at their disposal ( hillebrandt & wolff 1984 ).
we develop a self - consistent hydrodynamical model for io s plasma torus the bright ribbon. the model is based on recent hst observations of an extended neutral cloud in the jupiter - io system. the ionization of the neutral gas will induce a slip of the plasma relative to corotation as the plasma flows outwards and angular momentum is transported from jupiter out to the plasma flow. such a slip will induce significant birkeland currents which close in the northern and southern jovian ionospheres, producing the io s footprint and its downstream emission. significant correlation between emissions from the torus and that from io s footprints is expected. this is because the diffusion of ions is not isotropic in the plasma due to the existence of a strong magnetic field along the ion s orbital plane. galileo _ in situ _ observations show that the power supplied to the poloidal near io accounts for @xmath0 of the total euv power originating from the plasmas torus. our model calculation indicates that the total power dissipated in this process must be comparable to the energy dissipation in the plasar torus, which is relatively uniform along the ribbon. one of the outstanding features of the model predicted energy flows is a sharp increase of the electron number density and decrease in the flow velocity in io s wake, which may be associated with the processes near io based on the small mass loading rate. a self consistent model including these processes should also incorporate these processes in the system. we show that, when combined with the fuv and euv observations of the ionizing radiation from io, the recent fuv emission from the thin, narrow ribbon is very likely to be an ionization driven wind, which produces a significant fuv tail in the vicinity of io. this wind is then expected to be responsible for the auroral emission detected by asm / vla [ frank et al. 1998 ], which was recently used to constrain the mass loading near io.
we present a discussion of the charge distribution in a mesoscopic conductor in the presence of a scattering matrix. the local density of states which is obtained by summing the scattering matrix over the second contact index is considered. it is shown that the equilibrium and non - equilibrium charge distributions in the conductor can be described with the help of a hierarchy of states. at the bottom of this pyramid are the local _ local _ states which consists of carriers streaming from contact @xmath0 into the sample, irrespective of the contact through which they leave the sample. on the other hand, at the high - energy end of the pyramid the local states are the _ injectivities _ and _ emissivities _ of carriers entering the conductor through the first contact and leaving the sample at the next point. the latter are defined as the injectivity at which the emissivity of a point into the contact is zero and is related to the contact induced charge density via reciprocity. we also discuss the transmission probability of a scanning tunneling microscope which enters the sample with a potential perturbation. this transmission probability is calculated numerically and found to be close to the distribution of a free problem. in comparison to transmission probabilities obtained with a usual free problem the charge - to - charge fluctuations give the maximum transmission probability. we further show that the charge fluctuations are screened like the average charge density so that the resulting characteristic tunneling time is a non - monotonic function of the bare charge fluctuations. mesoscopic devices, quantum transport in semiconductors and other mesoscopic objects have attracted a lot of attention in recent years @xcite. a main topic in these devices is the transmission of quantum information through mesoscopic conductors. several techniques have been developed to enhance the transmission in small circuits. quantum pumping is one of the most successful methods for transmitting information in small systems. in contrast to classical transport, quantum pumping makes use of the weak interaction between electrons and defects in semiconductor heterostructures. an example of quantum pumping which has attracted attention in the literature is the conversion of a local wigner - smith distribution of charge into a global distribution of local states, giving the probability of positive or negative charges depending on the characteristics of the conductor. this conversion has been studied in detail for both idealized and out - going currents in a conductor, different types of conductors and quantum pumping schemes. in this paper we discuss aspects of mesoscopic pumping based on the scattering approach. we consider a conductor with a large number of contacts. each contact is treated as an infinitely
we initiate a study of the interactions associated with membrane splitting / joining processes in m - theory using the pp - wave matrix model. we show that the problem of constructing solutions to the euclidean equations of motion of this model can be reduced to that of solving the three - dimensional laplace equation in a riemann space. the latter can be mapped to a continuum version of the nahm equations, which in turn can be shown to be equivalent to the critical electroweak equations, leading to a semi - classical description of these processes in terms of the tunnelling amplitudes associated with states built on states containing different numbers of membranes. based on the ideas underlying the matrix model, with boundary conditions specifying the single or multiple membrane states between which they interpolate, we present an algorithm for the construction of an approximate solution to the instanton equations which we call the ` ` bps instanton equation '' and which describes the splitting of a single membrane into two. the approximation scheme used in our analysis is a continuum one, in which large matrices of size @xmath0 are treated as functions of the size of the potential used to represent the membrane in the bulk. the idea of the bps solution, underlying our analysis, is that the vacuum associated with a membrane splitting or joining process should consist of a collection of concentric membranes of different sizes and orientations, which interpolate between states containing the same number of membranes, _ i.e. _ finite action solutions. the interpolating membranes are instantons and the ideal vacuum corresponding to the finite instanton solutions, which are known as bps monopoles, are immediately away from their equilibrium states. although we give asymptotic values for the bound states, we find that their use is not essential. we then develop an analytic continuation of our approach, in order to study the properties of the associated moduli spaces and, as a consequence of this, we argue for computations of instanton - induced physical transition amplitudes. we discuss the possible consequences of this for the theory and discuss the strategy for computing these contributions in the full quantum gauge theory.
we present the results from the analysis of the greenwich and soon sunspot group data during the period 2000 - 2011. we have found that the amplitude of an even numbered sunspot cycle is smaller than that of its immediately following even numbered cycle, which is consistent with the well - known gnevyshev - ohl rule of modulation in the amplitudes of solar cycles. in the case of a number of sunspot groups ( @xmath0 msh ) there are noticeable differences between the epochs of the peaks of the maxima of the cycles of interest and the corresponding cyclic variations in the sunspot field strength. on the basis of these differences we have identified 3 groups of sunspots a grouped of size ( 1 msh, 2 days, and 4 days ) named as a group _ nlgs _, a group with the most frequent occurrence of the g - o rule ( period 180 years ), and a group in the large latitude range ( latitude 1874, 551 ) called as group _ nsgs_. the results on these 3 groups can be interpreted as the consequences of the statement that the ` strong waldmeier effect'is absent or weakly present in the complex sunspot data ( variation 18742011 ; period 2000 ; amplitude of cycle 23 ; period of cycle 24 ). in addition, it is also possible to infer from the variation of the position of the peak of the largest solar cycle ( 22, 23 ) that the 11-year cycle of this class of groups is more asymmetric ( i.e. its period is longer ) than the corresponding cycle of the preceding odd numbered cycle. based on the results of the present and previous studies it is possible that the origin of the asymmetric behavior of nsgs is related to the basic mechanism of the basic activity of the sun, namely the slope of the solar cycle. = 0.8 cm = -0.5 cm = * gonalves@xmath1 *, joshua b. ovchinnikov@xs. ocu - f-06 - 10, thomas a. groenewald@xi. ohu - het-10 - 14 *
we show that the observed fractal of the milky way molecular ism, the presence of clumpuscules even at low redshifts, and the even observed non - linearities in the extra galactic background, can all be understood if fragmentation proceeds according to a self - similar, quasi - isothermal process. in this context, we argue that the jeans mass must be quite large ( @xmath0m@xmath1 ), in order to prevent the formation of the first luminous objects. we therefore suggest that the first stars to form were the globular clusters, followed by the starbursts that formed subsequently. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 = cmr10 # 1#2 # 1, apj, # 10 # 0. # 2 m. l. neyson, during the early epoch of the universe, argued that clouds would form because the hydrogen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is ionised. this argument has been extended to various cosmologies, and has been successfully applied to the study of low - redshift quasars ( msx ). however, the scenario proposed here is opposite to that adopted by other groups, and even to the hierarchical model of formation. the main difference between the two approaches seems to be in the efficiency of cooling of the ism. in a previous paper, we showed that efficient cooling indeed leads to star formation in some cases ( as in the case of machos ), but it is not possible at present to check whether this is also the case for all primordial gas. here we show that all the star - forming clouds that form, are in fact bound systems. these objects will not be subject to recycling, so that their masses will always decrease as they age, and this can be used to check the low - efficiency hypothesis concerning the star formation activity in the first super - massive galaxies ( gmc ).
the interaction of atomic hydrogen with a cold plasma consisting of superconducting molecular hydrogen is investigated using the @xmath0 hyperfine splitting spectrometer, a combination of a microwave cavity and a sextupole magnet. state - conversion probabilities for mono- and mono - energetic hydrogen beams with different velocity ranges were measured using simultaneous radio - frequency and microwave oscillation measurements. the observed distributions of longitudinal velocity and mean hydrogen atomic hydrogen velocity showed very little dependence on the beam parameters, while the transverse velocity distribution followed a log - normal distribution. due to the small size of the ptfe tubing the observed line width was attributed to the predominance of the velocity dependent response of the atoms. however, when comparing the results with theoretical line shapes, it became apparent that the experimental line widths are dependent on the parameters of the external magnetic field inside the cavity and the beam propagation direction. the coherence times of the two - level system were found to be consistent with theoretical predictions for a one - dimensional, purely dipole - dipole interaction. in addition, it was found that a two - dimensional longitudinal magnetic field obviates the need for a strip - line cavity despite the large number of degrees of freedom in the beam geometry. hydrogen is a state - of - the - art detector for molecular hydrogen measurements, operating at cryogenic temperatures and efficiently dissociating hydrogen from a warm plasma into atomic hydrogen @xcite. the rapid cooling of molecular hydrogen and the subsequent dissociation of hydrogen atoms further allows for the measurement of the atomic kinetic energy and internal magnetic field, which can be used to probe the atomic hydrogen state. one of the major goals of modern atomic - hydrogen physics is to characterize and quantify the effects of quantum phase transitions, which are of particular interest for high - energy measurements. these transitions are particularly interesting for atomic hydrogen physics, since they are expected to be the dominant final states of matter after the hydrogen ionisation phase has terminated and the character of the emitted energy is essentially determined by the effective hydrogen ion, with only a small contribution from the remaining hydrogen ion. as a consequence, a complete knowledge of the transition line - width is needed in order to extract the information on the atomic state and its current energetics. this has recently been achieved using ultra - cold atomic hydrogen sources, in which the thermal motions of the hydrogen atoms are beamed into the tubes of a counter - part resonator. in this article, we would like to cover some of the involved transport parameters, which would allow us to calculate the state -
we study the geometry of the lmc using the data from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) survey ( denis ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ). the analysis is based on the @xmath0 mag apparent magnitude of apparent features in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) as a function of ( i ) the position angle of the line of nodes, and ( ii ) the average brightness of the lines of nodes. the method used here is the ` kinematic circular disk method'of weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ), which has been applied previously to study the inclination and position angles of the disk of the milky way. the results of our analysis are in agreement with those obtained from similar studies using the photometric circular disk technique, but the new data used here are more sensitive to systematic errors, and it is shown that the best - fit formal errors in the measurement of the viewing angles are much smaller. the denis results are compared with the results from the 2mass survey, yielding the same value for the viewing angle as found from the agb studies. the difference is accounted for by comparing the difference in the characteristic magnitudes of agb stars for the two different mode of their luminosity function ( lf ), as well as for rgb stars using their lf. the peak - to - peak rms residuals in the apparent magnitude variations along the ring - like features are found to be identical for all three bands. it is therefore possible that the brightness variations on the sky are related to lmc structure, and we interpret that the variations in brightness are caused by inclination - induced distance variations. we present a detailed analysis of the effects of possible spatial variations in the stellar population, including any resulting from dust absorption or metallicity, and find that such variations do not appear to appear at a significant level in disagreement with the uniform brightness variations that are observed. with the current data from 2mass there is tentative evidence for a line - of - nodes position angle that is offset from the major axis of the main lmc bar, in the direction from which we see the most of the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars.
we review superconducting state anisotropy effects in magnesium diboride mgb@xmath0 and review the results obtained by torque magnetometry. the superconductor is shown to be a two band conductor with an unusual temperature and angle dependence of the upper critical field @xmath1, which can not be explained by bcs theory. the two band nature of the superconductivity leads to two different effective anisotropies depending on the relative strengths of the two sets of electronic bands. the changes in the average electronic structure and in the ratio of the fermi energy gapped and ungapued sheets are analyzed based on the specific heat probes and specific heat measurements. further on, we review unusual temperature dependence of a number of electronic and magnetic quantities, and of the subspace occupied by the two bands, and we review their relation to interband mixing. general agreement is found between various experiments and theoretical studies. without any interband scattering, there are two transition temperatures between the two different sets of bands : an extreme crossover from a low field region where the quantities are determined by a single anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory, to a high field region, where they are almost solely determined by the anisoperiodic extensions of the fundamental bands, i.e., by a zero temperature crossover. the crossover can be well described by a crossover from an intrinsic ( low field ) thermodynamic thermodynamic ( thermodynamic ) field dependence to a strong one ( high field ) one, as well as by a quasi - continuous one, but with very different form and magnitude of the anomalous thermodynamic transformation from high field to low field. the case of the temperature - dependent anomalous temperature and magnetic field is studied in detail. the results of all kinds of measurements, including those involving a magnetic field, are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. in contrast, the results concerning the temperature dependence and the algebraic evolution of certain quantities, using a simple model for the scattering of electrons by phonons, are found to be in complete disagreement. finally, we discuss and compare results on the vortex matter phase diagram, drawn based on torque measurements.
recently, we have shown that electronic health records ( ehr ) can be used to resolve some first order physiological effects in healthy, long - lived people, in particular, the ` ` lack of data '' problem. here we want to demonstrate that using time - series ehr data for a large population over a long time period can resolve another important aspect of the problem. specifically, we show that a diurnal signal in the nonlinear correlation between glucose levels can be derived which is thought to be the first order driver of the glucose - insulin cycle, and propose a physiologic model to explain and rationalize this signal. to verify the usefulness of our model, we use a number of qualitative and quantitative measures, including the time - averaged, diurnal diurnal variability in the rate of glucose consumption by patients, the structure of the local environment in which the glucose is consumed, and the amount of time needed for a good understanding of the human endocrine system. we find that while there are many factors that can help to explain the magnitude of the observed diurnal variations, the ones that really matter are the details of the feeding structure and the relative amount of sugar consumption by different populations. using the measured diurnal pattern of glucose variability as a model, and allowing for inter - patient variability, we were able to separate the two populations, even though neither group was clearly defined on the basis of the diurnal timescale, suggesting that there is not a universal, time - dependent feature in the human behavior. that is, while one of the populations, namely the general population, show up with noisy periodic feeding structure, the other population, shows up with stable, long term diurnal structure. importantly, our model does not depend strongly on the by - hour glucose variability, which is an important feature for detecting human behavior on time scales longer than a day. finally, we also show that, by using a constructive physiological model, it is possible to constrain the model output, thus demonstrating that even though the model is not directly applicable to our situation, it can still be used as a means to investigate the human physiology over long time periods.
in this paper we present a security architecture that integrates privacy preserving data aggregation and access control for the first time in a smart grid. in this architecture a fully honest key distribution center ( kdc ) distributes keys and access policies to data senders and receivers. the policies are implemented in xml and the encryption mechanism uses kem - dem hybrid encryption, which is done in order to achieve privacy of the voter. at each smart meter gateway @xmath0, there is a gateway smart meter which aggregates data from smart meters in the ban and sends to the building area network via domain where only receivers with matching attributes structure can access the data. the data is encrypted using attribute based encryption using kdc. the main assumption is that the kdc can distribute keys to the remote users ( rtu ), such that the data are securely kept in the data repository and retrieved only from authorized users. we apply a recent variant of attribute - based encryption, proposed by lewko and waters, modified according to the needs of smart grids. we propose an access control scheme which gives access to the users content, while preventing them from colluding with rtu. it is to show that our approach is more efficient and stable compared with existing schemes. in details of implementation and performance we analyze the security and performance of our scheme. we present open problems and conclude on the other related issues. smart grids are next generation electricity grids system which will integrate power and communication networks. with the growing demand for electricity smart grids should have capabilities that would enable it to deal with power outages by balancing supply and demand. it should be possible to detect fault early in the system, to protect against cascading effects. conventional power grids utilize centralized command and control structures, such as scada ( supervisory control and data acquisition ), fiber optic cables etc. the protection from military threats is important to protect from terror attacks but also from customers, regulators and building authorities who tamper with various devices. security issues in smart grids mainly focus on authenticating customer, operators, and service providers.
we compute solutions of the lagrangian - averaged navier - stokes @xmath0model ( lans@xmath1 ) in three - dimensional isotropic turbulence for reynolds numbers up to @xotically large turbulent scales ( @xoto2 ), following a k41 inertial range followed by an inertial ranged, finally, a dissipative range, where the dynamics is described by the fully - converged ` ` ` fully - aligned '' solution ( i.e., no logarithmic corrections are required ). this comparison is performed in order to quantify the computational savings and to determine the numerical resolution requirements to obtain well - resolved solutions. we find that, in the inertial - range extending only to a minimal feedback constant, the optimal ` ` grid - independent '' solution is observed to minimize the numerical cost in terms of both the resolution requirements and the number of degrees of freedom in the flow. we also present the first detailed analysis of the third - order structure functions of three - dns. in this regime, the longitudinal structure functions ( ` ` attractor '' ) of large portions of the flow ( at scales smaller than the turbulent dissipation scale ) are completely frozen and, therefore, both the structure function and the degree of freedom of the attractor can be computed analytically. we verify that the size of the attracting attractor is smaller than that in the traditional fully - converge grid - aligned solutions. using this verification, we determine the critical value of the critical exponents for the required to model the observed energy spectra of the entire flow in the cascade and find that they are consistent with a theoretical prediction @xcite based on the assumption of a dynamically independent attractor. we show that removal of the non - helical taylor - green component from the spatial structure function ( which is a nodal function of the longitudinal velocity increments ) leads to a reduction in both in the structure functions and in the fluxes of the turbulent vortices and vortex modes. we provide evidence of coexistence of these two scalings in the energy spectrum in three spatial compilations of turbulent flows and show that they also contribute to the reduction of the dissipation in each case.
two dimensional turbulent flows are of great interest both theoretically and experimentally. in this work we investigate the existence of a conservation law in a two - dimensional linear incompressible flow which, after some time, corresponds to a linear flow. we show numerically, with some physical results, can be extended to a non - linear flow regime. indeed, we find that a long time scaling of the separations of particles of a given velocity realization is responsible for a power law dependence of the separation at small times, which can be analytically described in terms of a time dependent energy spectrum. we demonstrate numerically that this feature, which is expected to be an feature of any linear flow, is present in the flow of particles in a cubic box. after some initial separations, the separation taylor expansion of the flow provides a mechanism which allows for the observation of correlations at large times, that is, at the transition between the inertial and the dissipative regimes. in the last few years, a great deal of work has been devoted to the understanding how turbulent flows can flow in two dimensions and, in particular, to the resolution of the so called rnyi equations of motion @xcite. several examples are now known where this nonlinearity first leads to a power - law behaviour, e.g. in the description of turbulent enstrophy flow, followed by a cascade of cascades of turbulent flows, starting from a turbulent initial separation @xmath0, up to very large, ultimately to the large, final separations. this cascade seems to be a necessary condition for the onset of chaos, and, although it is known that linear flows can not only flow much faster than nonlinear flows, they can nonetheless be simulated in detail, because of a symmetry of the time dependent probability density functions, which enables one to relate the evolution of the velocity field to the linear behavior of the initial velocity or acceleration field. despite this symmetry, there is currently no theoretical prediction regarding the occurrence of a concomitant evolutionary feature, i.e. a transition to a dissipative regime, so far, and even a physical understanding of the linear flow is not yet available. a recent step in this direction has been taken by a numerical simulation of three - dimensional turbulence with external logarithmic volume splittings in a box, [ phys. rev. lett. * 54 *, 591 ( 2004 ) ], which showed that, in a certain range of separation, the relative dynamics and the flow behaviour deviates from
we investigate the effects of galactic superwinds on the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( whim ), using hydrodynamic simulations of a standard cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant. we focus on three metal emission lines, o vi, o vii and o viii, which may be used to constrain the whim baryonic content. we have studied the evolution of these species as a function of redshift and gas density, which we compute in a self - consistent way in our simulations taking into account both sources and sinks computed directly in the simulations. the physical variables that play important roles are gas temperature, gas density and peculiar velocity, which are explicitly computed here for the first time. we find that without gsw, non - equilibrium calculations of all these major metal species are quite successful in reproducing the existing observational line ratios, all the way down to the smallest scales probed by planck s uv and x - ray missions. gsw affect the line evolution primarily because they tend to avoid the large density knots in the outskirts of large density concentrations, i.e., they are located in the filamentary regions where the gas density is higher. line emission is rather poor tracer for some of the larger red contour concentrations, because the uv emission lines are too hot to be consistent with the simulated gas density distributions and hence these will often be offset from the main density features. by contrast, the o vi line is able to accurately reproduce the observed line ratios in the hottest regions of whim, within the error bar, due to its relatively small ionization timescale and the smooth ionization state of ionized gas. the number of o vi absorption lines per unit redshift at @xmath0km / s is typically very small, while there are about@xmath1 line superpositions per unit unperturbed redshift within the gsw effective area, which explains why it is difficult to detect o vi in x - rays. we also present detailed results on the absorption line blueshifts of the major oxygen species, including o vi ( 1038.6, 105038.0 ). in our simulation, about half of the iron in the icm is resolved and explained, suggesting that a substantial fraction of it originated in star formation, not from supernovae, but from nearby galaxy groups or galaxy - sized clusters.

we present an evaluation of the effectiveness of infrared ( @xmath0 ) colour selection techniques in identifying luminous and compton - thick active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). the main goal of this work is to evaluate whether agn selection techniques, such as the infrared agn wedge presented in m12, are able to identify with high efficiency absorbed agn missed in x - rays surveys. we use the largest catalogue of 887 type 2 quasars ( qso2s ) in sdss to evaluate the performance of our mir selection technique. the catalogue includes data from the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ surveys and all the short wavelength bands of the sdss spectroscopic database ( 3.4, 4.6, and 12@xmath15 m ) to search for agn candidates with red infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ). these objects are selected on the basis of their high rest - frame uv - to - mir luminosity ratio and high extinction of the optical lines. we find that our technique is highly reliable and very effective for the detection of ( x - ray ) luminous agn. at the highest luminosities we find 53.3 % of our selection technique to be reliable in detecting luminous obscured agn, especially for those objects with red seds that are not detected in the x -rays. this fraction increases to 75 % or more for luminous objects with the red colours not detected even in the hard xr rays. we also study the properties of the agn populations independently selected in the optical and xr ray surveys using the largest available datasets. while some objects show a featureless continuum, we find evidence that the continuum consists of several components with different contributions from star formation and agn activity. we show that the redder the continuum, the more the absorption. this is consistent with our finding that star formation activity plays an important role not only in the most luminous but also in the dust - enshrouded agn population. we conclude that, even if not strongly affected by heavy obscuration, the fraction of agn residing in massive hosts is still consistent with that found for the majority of the type 1 agn in the literature.

we investigate the stellar populations of elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies in the coma cluster on the basis of a magnitude limited sample of 115 galaxies within the central @xmath0 of the cluster. the aim is to derive the luminosity weighted mean ages and metal abundances of the galaxies, and to see how the derived parameters depend on other galaxy properties. we establish the relation between the metallicities and the velocity dispersions. the sample selection shows substantial variations in the ages and metallicities most of the time. if these variations are not taken into account, different ages result from different choices of the metallicity sensitive line index. the results from worthey et al. ( 1995 ) show that the line indices mg@xmath6 ( and fe5335 ) and c4668 ( iron ) have different effects on the derived ages. many e galaxies have [ mg / fe ] above solar value, while the most luminous e galaxies reach values of [ mg/fe ] as high as 0.3 dex above solar. we find that the variation of the mean age and the mean metal abundance with galactocentric radius is consistent with the predictions of self - similar models. no significant variations are found in the ratios of the metal to stellar abundances, suggesting that the galaxy stellar populations are not homologous. the m / l ratios for the e galaxies indicate that the galaxies have different dynamical structure, such that the masses can be derived from the strengths of the absorption lines. thus, it seems that rather large age and metal variations are present while the low scatter of the scaling relations is maintained. * key words : * galaxies : abundances galaxies : evolution galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies : stellar content
we present detailed experiments on raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in mono and trilayer ( mos@xmath0 ) of different film thicknesses and device geometries, as well as on transistors with different number and layer numbers. the properties of the localized states, which are connected to the random nature of the interfacial potential fluctuations, have been found to be very sensitive to the layer number. we demonstrate that the density of localized states is a universal property and independent of layer number and also scales with the number of atomic layers. we show that the mos3l bilayer, similar to graphene, has an activated density of states at high temperatures. finally, we discuss how the nature of scattering of carriers by impurities in two - dimensional electron systems can be explained. two dimensional mesoscopic semiconductors ( 2d mesoscopic insulators ) are among the most promising candidates for long term development of nanoscale electronic devices due to their flexibility, low cost and excellent mechanical exfoliation for thin films. of particular interest are highly localized ( @xmath1 ) states that are free of charge screening and thus enable transport with very high efficiency. these states are particularly interesting to develop electronic devices since they are expected to be easily manipulated by an applied electric field, @xcite such as a light emitting wand, which may in turn act as a switch on a high scale. an attractive feature of 2d electron systems is the highly localized character. on the other hand, the excitation of electrons in graphene is limited by charge screening, hence the high critical temperatures required for its application are high. several recent studies have shown that, besides repulsive charge scattering, a significant amount of positive charge scattering takes place also in thin films, either in bulk or in thin trilayers ( see, e.g., ref. [ ] and references therein ). this shows that, at least in the case of graphene, there is a large amount of ` ` on - demand '' charge screening in the device even though the confined electron states are relatively localized in most, if not all, graphene layers. this calls for an understanding of the physics behind such disorder, which can be achieved by properly designing the device geometry and by including the screening of impurities. we present here an overview of recent experiments conducted to investigate the origin of disorder in disordered mesoscopic devices, for which we first describe our device configurations and device characteristics. we then describe how our results can be used to explain the scaling of mobile devices with different
i examine the evidence for and against various astronomical mechanisms for causing mass extinctions and/or climate change. these include minor body impacts, cosmic rays, supernovae and gamma - ray bursts, solar variations and changes in the earth s orbit. i review the results of a recent study by raup & sepkoski, in which they investigated the periodicity in the geological and biological records of the earth. in particular, they found significant evidence for a periodicity of 26myr in the impact cratering record over the past 220myr. although they find periods in the vicinity of 16 and 20myr, respectively, these indicate that these are not real due to both age uncertainties, as well as the siderophile composition of several impactors indicating that they were not comets, which should have been included in the analysis. i outline how the upcoming gaia astrometric survey will be able to improve the situation. some of the issues raised in these reviews are directly related to the method used to analyse the data and the methods used to find an alternative alternative to the null hypothesis of randomness. these issues should be re - examined in the future. in addition, i discuss in detail the method of stigler & wagner for interpreting the same time series data in the literature. their analysis of the same data raises the question of whether such an alternative can be safely used to make definitive statements. finally, i outline several implications of these analyses. = -0.75 in # 1to 0pt#1 = cmr10 = cmbx10 scaled2 = cmti10 scaled1 = cmsy9 at 12 pt # 1@xmath0 # 1#2 @xmath1 * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) = 6.5 in.125 in.25 in
we initiate the study of long - distance quantum communication and cryptography beyond the use of entanglement distillation by introducing the concept of a quantum key repeater. this is a hypothetical state which each of the two parties ( alice and bob ) obtain a copy of the output state of a maximally entangled state which they share with charlie. we show that the fidelity of quantum repeater protocols based on local operations and classical communication ( locc ) is severely limited by the rate of private bit extraction from this state by quantum repeaters. we first show that well - known techniques from quantum information theory allow to conclude that the obtained rate of secret bits can be made unconditionally secure @xcite. we then show that this conclusion is invalidated by the fact that there exist states which are almost indistinguishable from separable states by locc. these states are thus private bits which can not be extended to private bits above a certain level of security. we furthermore show that it is nearly impossible to obtain distillable entanglements in such states, even with an enormous increase in the shield dimension of the repeater, by any locc protocol which acts on single copies of the state. in addition, we also show that a protocol based on the quantum teleportation of charlie and alice, that is, sharing an entangled state with an eavesdropper, fails to produce a private bit when compared to a public state for any value of the key rate @xmath0, even when all the correlations between quantum states are taken into account. in conclusion, our results point to the existence of different levels of distillability in entangled states which make it practically impossible to extract secret key from them.''' '' -1.5 cm * keywords : * entangled states, quantum key distribution, quantum information, repeater protocol, entangled states. [ [ sec : intro ] ] there are several natural classes of entangled states that have been discussed in the literature. for example, ppt states, that are genuinely random and secure, have a rate of security that is independent of the ( one - way ) separability of their output states, is a ppt state which is separable, though it is almost ppt free. interesting properties of these states have been shown to exist, e.g., in the presence of correlations between the in- and out - world world, by using local operations ( which may be thought of as the ` ` dirty little secret '' ). it has been shown, however, that great care has to
we establish a method for disentangling accretion and merging contributions to galaxy stellar mass assembly. the change in the mass function of galaxies due to the star formation activity of galaxies can be quantified by comparing their star formation histories as a function of stellar mass with the observed time derivative of the same. we take advantage of new data in the fors deep field to estimate the difference between these two. at fixed mass, we find that the average star formation rate of galaxies in the range @xmath0 is increasing with stellar mass and can be roughly fitted by a power law with exponent = 1.1. as stellar mass decreases, the rate starts to become positive with time. the zero - crossing mass decreases with time, with star formation rates dominating the initial increase in number density. the mass at which the assembly rate transitions from objects being consumed ( the number density of galaxies per unit stellar mass ) to objects being formed decreases as time progresses, tracing the break mass in the rate. in this transition mass range, more massive objects start forming stars earlier and at later times, reflecting the presence of more massive galaxies, and their subsequent growth and decrease due to mergers. we synthesize the evolution of the galaxy mass function using schechter functions and find a fit factor of 2@xmath1 for the time derivative. the smaller exponent corresponds to mass function evolution due to accretion, but the greater exponent signifies that the evolution is dominated by external causes. we quantitatively infer an effective merger rate of 0.8 effective major mergers per gyr from the data, which is consistent with 0.50.8 double effective mergers seen at high redshift. most of these mergers would be expected to result in elliptical - like galaxies being destroyed, but a significant fraction of them would likely survive unscathed by mergers, with the remnant compact objects being built by accretion or merging. the observational constraint on the growth of structure in the subsequent generations of ellipticals suggests that the time trend we observe is more likely due to external causes than internal causes, with external shocks due to star formation and/or merging dominating at high masses. we propose a model in which the surviving ellipticals we see are the progenitors of the present day ellipticals, the descendents of the spheroidal systems seen during their major epoch of star formation.
during the time variability and spectral characteristics of the x - ray transient grs 1915 + 105 during the irregular bursts we have shown that the source makes transitions between the two spectral states in a few seconds. the transition between the low - hard state and the high - soft state takes place at very similar time scales, i.e. within 25000 s@xmath3. the long time scale for the transition of the state is explained by invoking the appearance and disappearance of the advective disk in its viscous time scale. the results obtained from analysis of the rxte data are compared with that obtained during the quiescent phase of the source in 1996 july - august. the burst spectrum during the burst quiescence is characterized by a hard spectrum with the power - law index of @xmath01, and the total flux including the 0.5 10 hz qpos is found to be 0.015 % of the eddington limit. the power density spectrum ( pds ) in the range 0.1 to 5 hz is seen to be flat up to a few hz with an average power in this range of 0.01 ( rms / mean)35 hz@xft 3 which is consistent with the earlier observations. during the bursts the source shows an increasing rate of spectral changes which is similar to that seen in the galactic black hole candidate source cygnus x-1. the spectral changes in the low and high states are linked to the presence of qpo and the low frequency of the qpo. we have compared the results of our theoretical models with the observations and conclude that the accretion disk instability, which has been invoked to explain the short time scales of variability and irregular bursts in the media, can not be fully ruled out. other possible mechanisms for the origin of the bursts such as the influence of gas on the disk surface and the effects of magnetic fields are discussed.

we present a method to microscopically image surface - plasmon polaritons ( spps ) with a point - like optical tip in the forbidden - light zone. our method consists of using a scanning quantum source of light made of a single fluorescent nanodiamond glued at the apex of a fiber tip to generate a single spp quanta at each nano - vacancy position. after being irradiated by a continuous stream of photons emitted in different directions, the reconstructed image shows a four times enhanced spatial resolution compared to the corresponding image obtained in the direct space. therefore, our method offers a powerful way of making this cleaning step. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 m. a. nielsen and i. l. chuang, _ quantum optics _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 2011 ). v. giovannetti, s. lloyd, and l. maccone, ` ` extraordinary transmission of pure quantum light through a nanowire tip, '' phys. rev. lett. * 69*(22 ), 274002 ( 2004 ). a. n. vamivakas, m. inoue, a. furusawa, and m. t. vartanyants,``identifying and manipulating elementary excitations with nanometer - scale plasmons, '' nature * 446*(7137 ), 195200 ( 2012 ). s. lopez - aguayo, j. c. m. dosanjh, e. s. barnard, l. lpez, j.- m. montalban, p. r. tapster, and f. gourbilleau,``interferometric detection of single photons at the grating interface of a two - dimensional gold film, '' opt. express * 20*(6 ), 670684 ( 2011 ) r. boulanger, g. kloo, k. danzmann, and e. w. heissler,``an elementary excitation of gold nanocrystals that can be spatially resolved with sub - angstrom resolution, '' j. opt. soc. am. b * 21*(5 ), 11601173 ( 2002 ). j. gurandel, r. hardtke, and g. p. marangos,``precise detection of mobile nanostructures in the electromagnetic domain, '' new j. phys. * 14*(10 )
we get a general formula for the kac - moody lie algebra of a generalized cartan matrix of finite, affine or indefinite type. it is endowed with an @xmath0admissible subalgebra and a constancy ring. we prove that it is of the same type as the ( finite ) borel subal algebra of the cartan field. we discuss various applications and examples. kac was introduced in @xcite to study the relationship between algebraic geometry and lie algebras. his key tool is the lie algebra. a lie algebra is said to be _ complex _ if in every non - trivial real space, under general conditions, it has a unique representation ( in the sense of kardar geometry ) on the real space. in the case of singular and lorentz symmetric generalized functions, kac described the relations between existence and existence of global symmetries and commutativity groups. modern view on the relation between algebra and lie algebra, thanks to rubenthaler and nervi, has shifted much during the last decades. if one starts with the description of a _ regular _ ( resp. _ parabolicizable _ ) space of parabolic coordinates, such a space is classified as being _ finite _, _ affine _ and _ indefinite _, i.e. being strictly hyperbolic. various authors contributed to this understanding : m. blaufuss, c. lester, h. de riedmatten, w. tittel and h. zbinden. mathematics subject classification : _ 28d10, 28d25, 34c25. + an important development was the proof by of the property that the homology and homology groups of a given parabolic space are inextricably linked to its corresponding lie algebra ( sec.

we consider the generation and interaction of shock waves by nonlinear propagation. we formulate the weak asymptotic solution of the hopf equation and show how it can be used to describe the interaction of wave fronts with various types of discontinuities. the model is generalized to the case when the wave fronts merge. we obtain a formula for the dependence of the wave function on the distance from the center of the system on the basis of the dependence on the schwartz space and on the parameters of the broken line segment. in a similar way, for the case where we only have a single discontinuity, we obtain an expression for the variation of the rate of change of the discontinuity. the study of nonlinear waves is important from the point of view of wave propagation. a wide range of phenomena has been studied in the context of turbulence, mixing and condensation of waves, and in mesoscopic systems. the most well - known system is the flow of a shock wave in a fluid. a wave propagates in a normal fluid and at the same time merges with another wave that has the same velocity as it does not when the flow is diffused ( the so - called tidal wave ). the merger process is called the tidal wave coalescence. in the theory of tidal waves, the time evolution of the velocity of the waves can be studied by considering the propagation of a sample of waves that do not merge. this is possible if one studies shock waves that propagate with a regular velocity ( e.g., in a perfect fluid ) and does not mix with other waves. the wave - front coalescence model was introduced by erwin schrdinger @xcite. in this model, the front propagation does not depend on the path that the front takes, but only as long as this front does not merge with the other wave. the existence of a symmetry condition, or equivalently, a dividing line, is a necessary and not sufficient condition for studying the wave propagation in the presence of a boundary ( i.e., pressure ) between a divergence and a divergence of a divergence. the aim of this paper is to develop a general framework for studying nonlinear wave propagation that is general enough to allow us to study the combined evolution of wave functions and nonlinear systems with the help of the above simple technique.
recently, hele and althorpe ( ha ) proposed a new formulation of quantum transition state theory ( qtst ) for the classical limit based on the linear response theory and suggested that it provides an answer to the question of whether a true quantum tst can be defined as the exact @xmath0 limit of a quantum time correlation function. here we present a detailed analysis of critical aspects of ha s proposed formalism and of a modified path integral based quantum rate theory for the case of centroid dividing surfaces, showing that the formulation is consistent with the equivalence of the quantum rate derived by ha and the path integral quantum transition theory. in particular, we note that the imaginary time momenta of imaginary time path integral ( rdip ) excursion, which is often used in the formalism as a pseudospectral approximation for the rate, appear explicitly in the new approach, and argue that the resulting expression is expected to be exact. we also present a quantum rate expression based on a recently developed quantum dynamics formalism, which we have analyzed in detail in order to show that its approximate time dependent rate expression constitutes a genuine quantum rate. in addition, we analyze in detail a classical approximation error arising from the choice of the phase space in which the initial conditions are not strictly allowed. finally, we present an alternative quantum rate approach to rpmd - tst, employing the exact rate expression for the product oscillators in the limit of zero reactant oscillator power, and show that this approach yields a rate expression also reproduces the rate obtained by approximating the exact solution through a classical tst with a path integral. in the latter case, we find that the approximation error arises from the incorrect choice of phase space and time dependence due to the delocalization of the dynamical amplitudes in the quantum mechanical description of the oscillators. 2 [ ] [ q]-component, i.e., nonlinear kubo - transformed time correlation functions, and nonlinear doppler shifts at the barrier top, require more elaborate forms of quantum statistical mechanics than the well established yamamoto rate expression below the crossover temperature.
weak scale supersymmetry has been proposed as a solution to the hierarchy problem, _ i.e. _ it ensures that the electroweak breaking scale is consistent with radiative corrections without undue fine - tuning. however, to achieve this, the new susy states must be relatively light. the gluino and squarks component of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) are light, with mass between 400 and 500 gev, and may be probed by direct dark matter searches in the near future. on the other hand, the lsp is strongly fine - tuned, with a total sparticle production cross - section of only 0.02 ( 0.4 ) pb at @xmath0 = 14 tev. in order to probe the region of susy parameter space accessible to the next generation of experiments, it is desirable to address the question of whether the lhc will be able to detect a small portion of the lighter states. we show that the next - generation luminosity experiment, the laser interferometer large hadron collider(lhc ) at 7 tev, will allow to find unambiguous evidence for non standard model scenarios with light gluinos and sub - tev squarks, in agreement with the results of refs. @xcite and h. g. de vega@xmath1. moreover, the scales of the relevant cosmological observations are reasonably well defined, once the relic density is within present bounds. the higgs boson plays an important role in this quest, with its mass lying in the range 210 gev to 220 gev and if it is not found below 200 gev it will be difficult to detect. indeed, a higgs discovery at such low mass will be highly suggestive and will likely require a theoretical investigation over several years. finally, because of the constraints imposed on the dark matter sector, any significant higgs contribution to the cosmic dark matter relic density will have to be mediated through undetected sources. for this reason, there will be a large number of disconnected regions in the constrained parameter space.
we present a comprehensive analysis of the first @xmath0 corrections to the spin - wave spectrum in two - dimensional heisenberg magnet with dipolar interactions. we investigate the case of large spins that arises due to anisotropy in the total energy of the quantum 2d ferromagnet that makes directions along the edges of the square to be energetically favorable in the simple square lattice. we derive expressions for spin green s functions and the magnetization. the effect of the exchange anzotropy is also discussed. finally, the spectrum renormalization is carried out. * the results and implications of our analysis are widely applied to the study of magnetic properties of thin films. it is well known that in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) model, due to the dipolar interaction, short - range magnetic order at small temperature is suppressed considerably and the bare gapless spectrum can be greatly enhanced by gapless fluctuations at small momenta. in contrast, in the presence of the next - nearest - neighbor exchange coupling the gap in the spectrum is shown to be proportional to the inverse of the characteristic dipolar energy. the gap is formed due to a multi - orbital structure of the fermionic components and the longitudinal spin susceptibility is renormalized greatly even for large spins in 2d fm. then, according to the model predictions, the ground state is a hard target for finite - temperature fluctuations and consequently the long - range order is suppressed. this effect is called the ` ` dipolar gap '' and it was first observed in ref. @xcite. subsequent studies predicted the existence of such gap and other unusual features in the fm of 2d and 3d magnons, respectively. however, it was not observed till today that anisotropic effects also occur in these systems. in the present paper we present a consistent analysis of all the features that contribute to the damping of the open quantum gap at small momentsa. we demonstrate the relation between the gap and the anisolitude of the fluctuations that leads to finite temperature fluctuations. the possible underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not understood at present.
we present an experiment in which the output of a frequency - stabilized singly resonant optical parametric oscillator ( sropo ) is transferred to a free - running verdi laser by pumping noise from a confocal cavity on the side of a lithium - based ppslt crystal. we show an increase of the phase margin for frequencies close to 10 khz and an improvement of the gain of the proportional integral filter by 5 db. this represents an important step towards the realization of ultrastable quantum communications using such systems. 99 c. h. bennett, g. brassard, c. crpeau, r. jozsa, a. peres, and w. k. wootters, ` ` quantum cryptography using any two nonorthogonal states, '' phys. rev. a * 71 *, 013601 ( 2006 ). n. gisin and h. zbinden, _ quantum computation and quantum information _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 2011 ). t. j. kippenberg and m.w. mccutcheon, _ optical coherence and quantum optics _ ( springer, new york, 2001 ). d. bouwmeester, j.- w. pan, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, p. g. kwiat, and a. zeilinger,``a scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics, '' nature * 462 *, 474 - 476 ( 2007 ). m. t. rakher, l. ma, o. slattery, x. tang, and k. srinivasan,``long - distance quantum communication with a laser wavelength multiplexer based on rare - earth diodes, '' appl. phys. lett. * 100 *, 1499 - 1501 ( 2008 ). a. beveratos, j. b. abouraddy, n. p. alegre, s. a. borselli, and y. s. kuwata,``advances in solid - state quantum memories with eu@xmath0 ions and irreducible linewidths, '' ieee j. sel. top. quantum electron. * 20 *, 1699 - 1701 ( 2010 ). f. krausz, m. n. matsukevich, k.- j. otto, t. w. hwang, and r. blatt,
we develop time - optimal quantum computation theory ( _ t_-qct ) as a physical analogue of quantum optimal control theory ( oct ) in which the computation time is defined by _ physical time _, i.e., time is measured by the length of a sequence of one- and two - qubit operations. we investigate the sequence of unitary operators needed to realize a desired unitary by a unitary operation, and develop a krotov - like numerical scheme to solve the problem. the problem is a particular case of quantum brachistochrone for linear homogeneous constraints in which finding the gate - optimal algorithm is a discrete and combinatorial problem. in the context of oct, we find a general behavior of the time complexity of the optimal hamiltonian, namely, time - reversal symmetry and constrained time ( time ) evolution for certain hamiltonians. in particular, we obtain a proof of a theorem which holds under a time - dependent change of the phase of the unitary operator. then we define _ fidelity - optimal qct ( _ f_-qpt ) _ as a framework to study time - optimality of quantum computation. we prove that the latter is satisfied in fairly general situations, and provide a detailed numerical proof of the theorem. we also pursue time optimality by constructing an approximation method. interestingly, surprisingly, we get that both the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) and the asymmetric unitary are in the class @xmath0, which is equivalent to saying that time complexity and gate complexity are polynomial in the number of qubits, if so. further, it is shown that this is also true in the presence of a phase - dependent unitary. in fact, we show mathematically that the behavior which is found numerically is satisfied by the numerical method. thereby, we establish the connection between _ f _ fnt and _ t _ in a general context. we discuss the various connections between the two theories in detail and present our results in more detail. we conclude by giving a brief demonstration of the results obtained in this paper.
the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) has been suggested to be a possible mechanism to induce explosions in core - collapse supernovae ( crs ) and to be responsible for the acoustic oscillations of low @xmath0-modes in the accreting matter. in this paper, we study the sasi effects on the dynamics of a non - rotating proto neutron star, by comparing the results with the numerical ones in a realistic setup. we regard sasi as a source of pressure perturbations exerted on the surface of proto neutron stars, which in turn emit acoustic waves that are dissipated as they propagate outward to become shock waves. first of all, we find that the mechanism is rather inefficient, at least for the present model, favoring the neutrino heatings mechanism over the acoustic mechanism. since the calculation is based on an idealized model that mimics the realistic situation, we have performed a series of detailed numerical simulations with realistic parameters. in so doing, we use the pressure fluctuations in sasi that we obtained in the previous numerical studies [ di franco _ et al. _ 1998, _ astron. astrophys. _ * 1 *, l2923 ( 1998 ) ]. we have found that the normal mode oscillations are either in the linear or in the non - linear regimes, although the linear regime always gives the largest amplitude. moreover, the eigen frequencies and eigen functions, as well as the ratios of their angular frequencies and radial numbers, are significantly larger than the values given by the simulations when sasi is assumed, i. e., around a hundred milliseconds after bounce. these results are in good agreement with the recent multi - dimensional simulations by bhaskara et al.. 2
the present article discusses the theory and applications of the non - linear version of the nambu jona - lasinio model for the description of low - mass baryons. this model corresponds to a chiral theory where quarks interact with selfconsistently generated bosonic mean fields. the constituent quark mass is left as the only free parameter. the model is described in the chiral quark soliton formalism by diakonov, petrov and pobylitsa, as it is shown in the present treatment of the strange mass corrections. the calculations are performed for various radii, magnetic moments, mass splittings of the baryon octet and decuplet, and axial and spin properties of the nucleon. particular emphasis is put on gluonic degrees of freedom in barkons. predictions are given for strange form factors and tensor charges. without any readjustment of the parameters, a very good agreement between the prediction and the experimental data is found. hence the present model seems to be quite a formidable task, both formally and numerically. psfig.tex # 1#2#3mod. phys. lett. a * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 # 1 = cmssbx10 scaled 1 to 0pt#1^#2^#3_nuovo cimento _ infn _ + @xmath0 max planck institute for theoretical physics, 69117 heidelberg, germany + pacs number(s ) : 12.60.-i, 04.65.ud, 12.40.-m, 13.85.-t # 1eq.

we introduce a scenario in which feedback from a galactic stellar bulge on the formation history of the galactic bulges is closely associated with the formation of the central galaxy. we find that such a feedback can profoundly affect the evolution of the bulge - dominated galaxies. we demonstrate the effects of the feedback on the overcooling and missing energy problems of intermediate - mass galaxies ( @xmath0 at the present time ) with a bulge component. we discuss how the combination of the star formation ( sb ) and gradual stellar feedbacks is shown to be a viable way to solve these problems. in particular, we demonstrate that the sb - driven galactic superwind can be ejected or delayed by timely rarification of the halo gas, which helps the type ia sn - driven outflow to gently blow out the accreted material and replenish the ism with mass from evolving stars. we also examine the effect of varying the stellar accretion rate, the rate of stellar mass loss, and the treatment of cold gas on the structure and dynamics of the hot gas. it is shown that our model is able to give rise to a stable subsonic outflow for the long - term outflow conditions, although the detailed simulations are not large enough to show that the outflow is necessarily supersonic. the presence of a moderate amount of cool gas may help to solve the ` ` over - cooling '' and ` ` missing energy '' problems discussed in the paper. in addition, the model also predicts a higher x - ray luminosity from bulges in galaxies with low optical / uv luminosities. finally, we compare the results of our hydrodynamical simulation model with corresponding x-@xmath1-body simulations and find that the model is qualitatively consistent with the observations.

we show that the resonance in the optical conductivity that appears in the superconducting state can be obtained from an ab initio three dimensional calculation just by introducing to the electronic bands that can be associated to the cuo@xmath0 plane a gap, @xmath1, such that the optical allowed transitions are projections of the electronic states around the fermi level. we explicitly show that this can happen in the bi - family where there is an experimentally observed disappearance of the resonance with doping. we also make some experimental suggestions to prove the usefulness of our model. # 1#2#3int. j. quantum chem. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 hep - ph/#1#1 # 1 # 2 # 3 _ j. phys. _ ( # 1 ) _ # 2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, l#3 ( # 4 ) [ phys. rev. _ b * 54 *, 1953 ( 1966 ) ].. where possible, the model is put on its own pedestal. _ the _ best - description model is based on a three - dimensional equation for the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) where the eigenstates are given by the kubo - greenwood formula and the equation is valid for arbitrary values of the electron density matrix. the effective hamiltonian for the qcd is given by m. j. russell, m. h. martin, and j. b. pendry, in terms of the ising - laplace equation, @xcite. the key idea in this model is to use the lower - triangular lattice elements to reduce the energy difference between the final and the initial state and this does not change the electronic band structure very much. the physics of this is easy to understand on the basis of the single - particle approach. on the other hand, a lot of work has been done in order to get rid of the underlying physics and to identify a new mechanism of superconductivity. this is probably the most difficult problem in physics. the closeness of the problem to the problem prevents us from getting any useful answer even when we have a very good idea about the origin of the phenomenon. the really hard problem is that even though we can not solve the problem completely, we can make some progress by looking at the underlying physical mechanisms and they should be able to contribute to the explanation of the observed phenomenon. in this paper, we do exactly that by carrying out the calculation of the optical
we provide a heuristic argument to explain the existence of stationary solutions in the macrostate dynamics of random networks. the stationary solutions are introduced using the geographic coarsening approach. we show that they are generically stationary solutions when the fraction of agents committed to a opinion exert a constant pressure on the boundary of a domain. the pressure forces opposing an opinion domain to reduce its size. when the proportion of committed agents reaches a critical value, the system undergoes a spatially metastable separation of opinion domains. the result shows that committed agents are more powerful in changing the prevailing social opinion on random networks with low average degree. this result is in agreement with the results of our previous study on sparse random networks but the ` ` more powerful '' factor is not the smaller tipping fraction, but the shorter time to consensus. on random random networks, the average degree of an agent @xmath0 tends to infinity often, in analogy to what is observed in continuum diffusion at zero temperature @xcite. hence it is important to understand the kinds of structural parameters which determine the macroscopic dynamics. on the other hand, the knowledge of the local dynamics on a network ( e.g. the degree distribution ) is not sufficient to know the long - term future behavior of the system and it is essential to have a basic understanding of the opinion dynamics. many complex systems exhibit stationary states, in which each individual opinion is either asymptotically stable or unstable. in this paper, we show there is a new type of stationary solution that is generically stable, namely, the _ opinion domain boundary _ which demarcates two straight regions of the network. it consists of an even number of stripe - like opinion domains, each of which is either stationary or metastable. it is the latter type of solution that leads to the emergence of a stationary boundary state. to study the shape of the boundary, we calculate the distance between two domains and find the critical value for the correlation length. assuming that the two domains are separated by a curvature of zero, we obtain the mean - field equation numerically. we obtain a dependence of the consensus time on the system size and the committed fraction. we also show the numerical results agree well with the numerical plots.
recent results from a coordinated data analysis workshop devoted to answering the question : ` do all coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) have flux rope structures?'such a specific physics - based question shows that we have come a long way towards understanding the nature of explosive events especially when we consider the original definition of a cme : ` a relatively short scale white light feature propagating in a coronagraph s field of view.'we found that the ` two - front'morphology ( faint front followed by a bright loop ) is a reliable indicator of cme - driven waves, or shocks, at least in the case of ` 3-part'-cmes. more importantly, the faint front can be identified in films of halo cmes taken with the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; ) on - board the _ solar earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation _ (chi ; ), providing a much simpler and more uniform framework for identifying cmes among tens of thousands of observed objects across more than a hundred years of observing time with the coronagraph. by selecting a sample of 65 cmes with an average redshift of 0.44 and by analyzing their occuration rates in the solar optical and near infrared, we find that 41 % of cmes occur as fr - cmes. however, this number drops to 33 % when the event is categorized as a loop cme or a curved - front cme, the two most commonly used morphological categories. we provide statistics on the occurence rates for different structural classes and find that the three - dimensional fr morphology for cmes comprises 5 % of all events, including 28 % of fast - erupting frs and can be easily interpreted as cmes having 5- or six - dimensional structures. we conclude by pointing out the existence of faint, relatively sharp ` fronts'just ahead of the bright loop in many cme images and conclude that these fronts are likely results of local density compression and not of piled - up plasma.
we study the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7172 using data from the _ asca _ satellite, the _ ginga _ experiment, and the _ cgro _ osse data. the gis data allow us to study the intrinsic spectrum of the source over a broad range of wavelengths, e.g., @xmath0 kev. by fitting the two data sets, we find that the spectrum is flat, with an intrinsic e - folding energy e@xmath1. the flatness can be explained by a two - component model, consisting of a power law and substantial absorption, along the line of sight. the cold disk and the hot matter in an accretion disk subtend a substantial solid angle to the x - ray emitting corona, so that the amount of reflection is proportional to the ratio of the observed reflection spectrum and the continuum. the discrepancy between the spectral fits and the value obtained from the asca data suggests that either the absorber has a large density, or the slope of the spectrum has changed. we analyse and fit data from march and may 1995, separately, as well as data from 1989. the spectrum in the first two years is found to be similar to that from 1988. in the 3 months since march 1995, the source has shown no further evidence of variability and the fluxes at the 2 - 10 kev level are very similar to what was found in 1989. this flat spectrum, if confirmed, has implications for modelling the absorption component of galaxies with a simple power law. models with two absorbers, one with a high column density and the other with a low, but significant column density, may be able to explain the data without contradicting the other observations. the lack of variation in the spectrum over a period of two months is also consistent with a change in the viewing geometry, in which the central region has been shadowed by the outer regions.
we show analytically that complex networks of collaborative investments can be constructed between self - interested agents even though single agents possess insufficient information for computing the total investment made by any other agent and although the level of cooperation that is reached in a community is not fixed rigidly by external constraints. our analysis provides a rational which links the response to the withdrawal of resources to an inflection point of a benefit function. furthermore, we investigate under which conditions non - reciprocated collaborations appear. the proposed model can be verified in laboratory experiments in which people interact via computer network and study the properties of the network of bilateral collaborative interactions. * there has been a growing interest recently in examining the topological properties of real - world systems such as social networks @xcite. social networks are network structures in which individuals, either single or in groups, have an important influence on each other and on the decisions that are made by other individuals. although most of the research has been focused on models where individuals link directly to other individuals, many aspects of the behavior of social networks have nevertheless received much less attention. for instance, it is far less common to observe networks where all individuals are invested equally, or in a group in which every individual makes an equal contribution to the collective success. in the present paper we propose a model where individuals, instead of being randomly connected to each other, cooperate by investment in a single complex network. this topological property allows us to study the possibility of formation of sophisticated networks in which all individuals contribute equally to the total success of the collective effort. in particular, we are interested in models in which the benefits of the collaboration are fully distributed in the form of unidirectional links, to which all participants are attached. in such networks we can observe versions of the glassy collaborative behavior observed in numerical simulations. *
the stars s1063 and s1113 in the field of the old open cluster m67 have attracted special attention due to their likely positions in the color - magnitude diagram. both stars are double - lined spectroscopic binaries with periods of 18.4 and 6.8 days, respectively, and a projected radial velocity of 33.45 km s@xmath0. while the precise proper motion of the primary star in m67 is debated, current existing measurements of the proper - motion properties of the binary are consistent with it being a cluster member. both binaries show photometric variability on timescales longer than 18 days, but with no clear period variability for periods greater than 20 days. in the context of this study, we recommend using the single field - star interloper model to account for the multiple radial - velocity measurements of both stars. this model requires that the uv flux from each star be balanced against the flux from the co - moving primary star, and that the ratio of primary to secondary v fluxes is set by the distance to the cluster center. the geometric argument strongly supports this interpretation, though the variability of the composite light with the orbital period can not be fully ruled out for the two stars. if the variability is caused by asymmetries in the photometric light distribution, then both stars should be highly reddened, with a mean reddening e(b - v ) = 0.14 - 0.18. in contrast to m67, the entire galactic reddening in the direction of our cluster is only 0.03 mag, thus the implied enhanced reddening of s1097 is likely centered on the primary. ground - based observations are not consistent with the existence of warm circumstellar dust in this system, and we suggest that the x - ray emission is due to rapid rotational motion. finally, we note that both stars show significant absorption in the ca ii h and k lines, and both are likely chromospherically active stars.
we track the evolution of the inferred star formation rate ( sfr ) from cosmological observations using various methods, and we track the corresponding ionization and chemical history of the universe. we work in the context of a hierarchical model for structure formation which includes star formation and chemical evolution, coupled to a detailed model for chemical evolution. we assume a single mode of star formation which extends up to redshift @xmath0, depends on the assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and a possible intermediate case where the sfr is scaled down by 0.3 dex. for each of the four sfrs considered, we characterize the resulting star formation history by a fit to the far - uv and far - ir luminosity densities of galaxies as a function of redshift. we find that the stellar mass density inferred from the galaxy luminosity function ( csfrd ) matches that observed over the entire observed redshift range, though somewhat closer to the true value than the @xcite luminosity density, suggesting dust attenuation might be important in some cases. for the case where additional low - mass star formation is required, we optimize the choice of the assumed sfr in order to minimize the impact of potential systematic uncertainties induced by the unknown stellar mass - to - halo mass ratio. we show that for reasonable escape fractions, the observed optical depth of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ), derived from grb data, is sufficient to explain the entire range of grb rate data, including emission line data, for all cases considered. this naturally leads to the idea that grbs should be better metal tracers ( and also sfr tracers ) at high redshift than the cmb at lower redshifts. we also explore the possible implications of a truncated grb period in which grbs are associated with dwarf galaxies and find some observational support for this idea. # 1 # 1#2#3#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # 110^#2^#3 # 1eq.

we use the bondi - hoyle accretion model with external magnetic field to compute the x - ray emission from the accretion flow around a low luminosity ( @xmath0 kev ) supermassive black hole. we correct the observed optical to uv spectral components for the effects of stellar x - rays, and we find that the resulting spectra are consistent with the multi - wavelength observations of the black hole in m31 *. the strong uv emission appears to be produced by the post - shock gas initiating its infall toward the central accretor, rather than by the winds of nearby stars. because stellar winds are highly supersonic, many shocks can form where the ambient gas is captured before it is fully integrated into the central gravitational field. for a given accretion rate, these shocks dissipate most of the kinetic energy and reduce the plasma temperature to a much lower temperature during its infall, so the emission will appear as an extension of the radio component. we identify several hydrogen line emission lines that may be used to verify our model. our calculation also allows to identify the components of the uv to radio continuum emission, so that we may use this component to discriminate between the different accretion scenarios. in general, the emission spectrum is very well fit by the model, and it can be described by a broken power - law with a photon index of 1.9, where the break is due to line emission and the photon index is usually larger than 2. the temperature of the gas flowing through the hole is typically several million kelvin, but the plasma may settle onto either a hot branch or a cool branch as it progresses toward smaller radii and lower temperature. the line emission is dominated by the line cooling, so we include a cooling term to the flow in our analysis, which is not negligible in the stress - energy tensor because it gives the plasma energy and momentum loss rate due to radiation. the cooling rate in the case that the radiation is not very strong can be treated as an external field, which just contributes to the cooling term. we compare our results to the observations and find that in order for the system to account for both the radio and uv components, either the plasma is located on the unstable portion of the cooling curve or the gas has a high specific angular momentum relative to the central object. the latter choice seems to be favored by the observations. the complexity of the problem may be reduced by taking into account the attenuation along the line of sight.
the analysis of a deep, homogeneous database of galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) with homogeneous photometry from the acs survey of galactic gcs ( *??? * paper v ) is presented. a total of 65 gcs from this sample are used to study the variation of horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology in the @xmath0 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and also to estimate the metallicity of the stellar populations present and also estimate the metallicities of the gcs for which no spectroscopic information was available. in order to allow direct comparison with gcs observed in different bands, about one quarter of the sample gcs are found to have hbs with red hbs. however, not all gcs in the sample will be considered in the analysis. the mean level of the hb in the outer halo gcs is found to change from the red to the blue component of the rgb in 2 - 2.5 gyr. in some gcs where blue hbs are found, a transition to a red hb is indicated by the presence of a faint, blue hb tail in the cmd. the faint tail is most commonly found in gcs with relatively metal rich gcs. in other gcs, the morphology changes appear to be due to age variations. with the aid of a simple, synthetic data analysis, we show that the degree of abundance variations in the galactic gc population along the red giant branch ( rgb ) and along the blue horizontal branch is a general feature of the galactic hb morphology. a trend between the integrated luminosity and the integrated ( or luminosity ) of a gc and the average degree of luminosity of its hb stars ( or integrated light ) was found. models in which the average ratio of the mass - to light ratio ( i.e. the ratio of hb tip to rgb tip ) changes from a red to a blue component or a red clump is supported by the observations. we also present the first detailed comparison between gc distance estimates and proper ccd - era estimates. we find that the necessary age difference between two peaks in the gc locus in the _ i__band and outside the halo is about 4 % and that the difference is only slightly less than 1 %.
we study the social response to emergency events using a de - identified dataset from a large mobile phone company in an european country. the data consist of approximately 10 million mobile phone users and more than four years of cell phone activity, including both voice calls and text messages. as the activity spikes of @xmath0 users for emergency events are both temporally and spatially localized, the communication of@xmath1 users becomes the most important means of spreading situational awareness, and, therefore, we can estimate their communication patterns by monitoring their reciprocity. to quantify the extent to which such social activity affects the response of the affected population, we characterize the reciprocity of communications between different user groups by measuring call volume changes during the event period. we find a strong increase in reciprocity for the four events during emergency events we studied : ( 1 ) during panic attacks, ( 2 ) when the call volume is normal days, and when the event s time interval is odd, ( 3 ) call - back actions are dominant, i.e., those transferring money or requesting money from a bank account to another bank account are up to 50 % higher than during normal periods, ( 4 ) call forward actions have a higher average than call back actions, and ( 5 ) social ties are characterized by different sensitivities, so that frequent calls from the same individuals receive calls from different social neighbors with different reciprocities. these findings indicate that during emergencies both dissemination and call - number distribution of information are important for the effective social response. to understand the origin of the observed behavior, we study two different mechanisms to generate and maintain social information. first, we design a proper control for normal days to make the call volumes between event day and normal days comparable. to this purpose, we scan calls for a number of ` ` normal '' days, one week from the event day, and compare their call volume time series. moreover, we determine how unusual the observed activities are connected to the normal days call volume patterns. to overcome the shortness of the time series, we propose a control procedure to generate call volumes in a manner that is consistent with the results of previous studies. our findings provide insight into how social systems respond to crisis situations, and how collective social organizations play an important role in preparedness and response.

we present a thorough and general study of the magnifications that can be produced by lenses with different radial profiles and angular shapes, without creating multiple detectable images. we compute the overall probability for magnification with additional detectable images, and use it to evaluate the hypothesis that the four @xmath0 sdss quasars are highly amplified by lensing. if we are extremely optimistic about the strong magnification bias and about all low - mass halos having steep isothermal profiles, we can imagine that the probability of a@xmath1 quasar being magnified by at least a factor of 10 without having a second detectable image is 29 %. this maximum is reached only in a toy model where the lens and source potentials are more than 99.3 % and 50 %, respectively. in more realistic models where the shear and ellipticity are small and the lens potential is more complex, the probability that two images are detected is less than 29 %, and therefore the lensing effect is dominant over the magnification. this result can be applied to find the number of dwarfs that are highly magnified, and it should be applicable to halos with nfw profiles and without a super - eddington lens potential. we identify a number of objects that are very efficient lensing systems, and compare them with the expectations of a simple ellipsoid model. no obvious differences are obtained, and the magnification cross sections are presented for different models. our results suggest that the tidal shear is relatively small and well - described by exponential scaling, so there is no need to invoke an octopole or other term to describe magnification. we compare our results to the recent hst images of the four sdss qasars, and find that the lack of detectable additional images is a clear signature of their ` ` single - detectable - image criterion ''.
we prove the existence of globalizations of the classical invariants of quadratic forms modulo hyperbolic forms. we show that the witt groups of the bounded derived category of quasicoherent modules with coherent cohomology are naturally related to the ideal bilinear form. we conjecture that the higher invariant of a non - degenerate symmetric form is inextricably related to its abelian group. the notion of unramified complex fields was introduced by kersten @xcite, who proved that the hopf algebra of a general field is wordy ( i.e. quotient of a trivial galois module with trivial coefficients ). the idea of defining characteristic fields in terms of subalgebras was proposed by lee and yang ( *??? * ; ljubljana * 1.1 ), and subsequently developed by many authors. the most important observation in the field theoretical literature is thomason s proof ( in the american journal of mathematics, volume iii, pp 133 - 224 ) of the milnor conjecture ( using _ any _ of these fields ). even if one does not specify which type of characteristic field, the result is still useful in the case of a globalization. in this paper, we provide a proof of the conjecture in the light of a very long history. we do not address the specific context, but we try to show as often as we can that a globalization of an algebraic field roughly corresponds to a localization of its associated commutative unital ring ( taking the presheaf on the corresponding planar forms ). because of the relevance of our result, it will be of interest to the community, and in particular to see how it can help a problem related to our question. for the sake of concreteness, we will restrict ourselves to the realm of algebraic fields. we will apply the method we developed in section [ sec : models ] to models of quantum field theory and solve problems based on the underlying theory of quantum fields.
we present a scheme for realization of a quantum spin transistor realized in a heisenberg spin chain and analyze its physical implementation with cold trapped atoms. the scheme consists of transferring spin excitation between the initial and final sites of the chain via a single resonant intermediate state in the single - excitation space of strongly - coupled sites. we show that this scheme can be quite robust with respect to moderate variations in the control spin energy and magnetic field, but is rather sensitive to small variations in these two parameters. finally, we demonstrate the operation of the proposed spin transistor with a system of four atoms in a one - dimensional trap. spin electronics, the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom, is an important field of research in condensed matter physics @xcite. in this context, there is a renewed interest for spin transistors since they can potentially be used for quantum information processing with trapped ultracold atoms. several schemes for realizing a spin transistor have been proposed in the context of realizations of the @xmath0 model spin chain in a cold trap. in these schemes, a control spin is placed in the central region of the gate, and a tunable magnetic field is applied to the target spin. by a proper choice of the field, the gate may be open or closed for the transfer depending on the state and strength of the interaction between the control and target spins. recent experiments have confirmed that spin chains with a spatially symmetric spin geometry may be realized in cold atom traps@xcite, and it has been proposed that an efficient spin transistor can be implemented with these chains as building blocks for a quantum spintronics device. in the quantum spin - transistors proposed in this work, the control spins are endowed with an excitation energy which is decoupled from the other spin states in the chain, so that the mutual spin exchange can be treated as a single excitation field. the hamiltonian describing the spin - spin interaction in a spin chain is a two - level system with global and local symmetries. the phase coherence of these two phases is determined by the exchange strength between a single target spin and its environment, i.e., by the local magnetic field. this ising model has been used to realize the ising limit in several different systems ( see, e.g., ref. [ ] for an overview and further references ). the existence of a critical coupling between the spin and the local spin states has been shown to be an important issue in the characterization of quantum transport in solid -
we present giant metrewave radio telescope ( galex ) 3.5@xmath0 m images of the young stellar clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc300. special care was devoted to refine the photometric method so as to obtain accurate spectral energy distributions for the young clusters, and to remove the background stellar emission from old populations. the 3 hottest sources are located close to the young stars, with a mean free path of 2175 in the fuv and nuv bands. their optical to mid - infrared colors show clear variations, at a level comparable to that of point sources in several nearby molecular clouds. we analysed the 3antly correlated h i doublet and ir array images to constrain the geometric properties of the stellar clusters, assessing the influence of the nearby hot interstellar medium on the shaping of the dust. we apply the shakura & sunyaev ( 2003 ) model to the diffuse h ii emission, and use the isotropic fluxes of the clusters to calibrate the model. we find a systematic difference in the dust properties between clusters very close to and very distant from the exciting stars, most likely due to a varying proportion of small dust grains with respect to big grains. this effect is more significant in the vicinity of young clusters than in the outermost parts of the disk, where the dust is more easily removed by winds and supernova explosions. after correcting for extinction, we find an excess of emission at 3 - 5 @xmath1 m, which is spatially related to young clusters but not to the extended h ii doublet. we argue that this excess is unlikely to be due to young stars alone, and that it is likely to be produced by point sources, which are located very far away from the clusters and have not yet evolved to become ionizing sources. this result does not support the hypothesis of an ` ` old '' stellar population, of which some clusters have ages of a few tens of myr. because aromatic band emission is not associated with cold dust, and because it is dominated by photospheres, we suggest that most of the intermediate - infrared emitting dust is in the form of large, photospheric shells, rather than associated with hot dust.

if the low bolometric luminosity of sgr a * is a sign that it possesses a magnetic moment then it must possess an intrinsic magnetic moment or a quantum moment which can significantly reduce the accretion rate. if this were the case, the radiative cooling of the accreting plasma within the magnetosphere would cause its luminosity to drop well below the eddington limit value. we show here that for a strongly magnetic equatorial flow, the quiescent x - ray luminosity would be too bright for its to be consistent with observations unless the jet outflow contains a substantial amount of non - thermal electrons. such an outflow would produce optically thick synchrotron radiation with positive spectral index at frequencies below the sound speed and would produce radio flares. however, the predicted timing of these flares is consistent with the meco model, with sub - mm flaring preceding the strongest near - infrared and soft / high @xmath0 radio flares and stronger delayed radio and optical flare emissions. the luminosity produced in the equatorial inflows would be comparable to, or even higher than, that in standard thin disk accretion models of accretion flows into a black hole, however there is no evidence that the bondi accretion flow within the schwarzschild radius would produce any strong radio flares in quiescence. we then show that there is a natural limit to the spin rate that can be produced by magnetic meco - jet outflows into low mass objects. in the absence of a magnetic propeller mechanism, the only way that this model can explain the observed low luminosity is that the magnetic moment and spin rate are intrinsically different for the two systems. we present analytic solutions for both types of systems and show that while the global distributions of the electron density and magnetic field are needed for a robust comparison of the results with observations, a reasonable middle ground can be found in which the properties of both systems are similar. psfig.tex # 1"cd # 1.#1"c7 # 1
we present a high - resolution cosmological @xmath0-body simulation of the formation of the largest and most massive cluster of galaxies known. we consider spheroidal galaxy models that include both a stellar bulge and a dark matter halo in the central part of a proto - cluster. the galaxy models are constructed to resemble the observed local environment of the bcg, and we ensure that the galaxies obey a prescribed mass - size relation, which ensures that the convergence of the simulations is reliable. we also investigate the evolution of the mass - to - light ratio and the relationship between the stellar and dark matter components of the cluster by considering the kormendy relation, the depolarization of the baryonic components and the two - body velocity dispersion relation. in this paper we focus on the case of a cluster with ten times higher number of galaxies than the canonical ensemble of bcgs. we confirm that the central baryon density is similar to that of the average early - type galaxy, and that the tilt of the fundamental plane derived from this cluster is close to the prediction of the standard faber - jackson relation for high galaxy masses. the mass of the bulge in our cluster is much more than that found in other similar objects at similar redshifts, which suggests that the contribution of agn activity may play an important role in quenching cooling flows and star formation in massive galaxies. we identify a new set of massive cluster members that are located at the very centers of the clusters, which allows us to compute their merger histories. we find that the merger histories of the observed elliptical galaxies are consistent with the number of dry mergers and the fractions of merger events experienced by the system. this sets a lower limit to the total mass of a single - dry merger. however, recent x - ray observations performed with _ chandra _ and _ xmm newton _ indicate that the star formation rate in these high - density environments is likely to be strongly inhibited. we conclude that models in which most of the central mass of galaxies is experienced by major mergers may overemphasize the role of agns in the early dynamical evolution of clusters and underestimate their contribution to galaxy formation. we discuss how the cluster bcg evolution can be understood in the context of current structure formation models.
we use a sample of 72 galaxies drawn from the _ z _ @xmath0 1 deep2 redshift survey to investigate the prevalence and strength of outflows in systems with large star - formation rates ( sfrs ) but a wide range of morphologies. we find that the outflow detection frequency is consistent with previous observations based on absorption lines in local samples. in agreement with this, we find a strong correlation between outflow velocity and sfr, although our sample is not complete in any sense. at the 2.3@xmath1 level, our sample exhibits a range of outflow velocities, with a median velocity of 40 km s@xday1. a significant fraction of the sample exhibits maximal outflows at a velocity of approximately 40 km sec@xhed, or approximately 5 % of the total sample. we attribute these characteristics to the fact that the lines we observe are attributed to gas flows and not galactic rotation. motivated by the redshift distribution of our sample, we suggest that gas flows are responsible for the observed centroid shifts in the rest - frame uv absorption lines of fe ii and mg ii. using _ galex _, _ hst _, and _ spitzer _ imaging, we investigate to what extend the centroids of the mg ii absorption lines are blueshifted, and to what extent the blueshifts remain redshifted after we include the stellar continuum. outflows are predominantly detected at the centroid position of the red wing of [ o ii ] emission, supporting the hypothesis that these lines are formed by the transition of gas outflowing from the galaxy into the intergalactic medium. the redshifts of the absorption lines which we present evidence for are at least 40 % higher than the corresponding centroides. we investigate the origin of these differences using a simple model which postulates that the differences in blueshift are due to a continuum in the gas flow velocity between galaxy systems of different masses. we conclude that our observations support the proposal that outflows provide a continuum of gas cycling and therefore represent an important evolutionary tool for understanding the physical processes which drive galactic mergers.
we study the relationship between the appearance of new industries and the appearance or disappearance of other industries within the same country. in particular we find that ( i ) products appear cluster - wise in creative bursts and ( ii ) increases the chance for new products to be pushed from the market and ( iii ) the emerging products are typically associated with higher income and a higher level of economic complexity. the effect of shifting production towards higher complexity is strongest in the developing countries of latin america, eastern europe and east asia and pacific and almost always stronger in the least developed countries or in the largest economies. we show that these observations can be naturally explained through the onset of a creative phase transition, a process started by introducing novel goods or services and resulting from the recombination of capabilities. we calibrate the schumpeterian diversity dynamics model with the initial product diversities and ( dis)appearance rates observed through world trade data and constrain the position of the transition regime from low to high diversity. the analysis of the dynamic patterns of creative destruction reveals the existence of a critical value for the product diversity, equal to a threshold value defined by the products transiting a country from one country to another. this threshold value depends on the relative mixture of capabilities and is below a certain threshold and is only exceeded when there are not enough capabilities available to find successful combinations of them. * the advent of digital trade data has shown that an era of economic prosperity is underway in many developing countries. a rapidly growing economy relies on the export diversities of their citizens and the products they produce is of great interest to the world - wide. in a recent article @xcite we introduced a new product metric, the @xmath0, that uses stochastic frequencies of appearances of products followed by disappearances of products in a country over a period of years. the metric is used to quantify the occurrence of events of a particular type of product in a specific product category and its co - appearance in the same product category. the model is based on the concept of ad hoc substitution of products by substitutes for capabilities. the substitution consists of adding new capabilities to what has an effect on the market dynamics. in the first section of this article we introduce the model and trade data analysis, while the second section focuses on the development of the quantitative aspects of the model. the use of the product metric reveals that the production of goods is not restricted to a single process, but rather it is a combination of several processes that start from a production process and end up in
shapley is the most massive object known to exist in the local universe, and is possibly the most luminous object currently known. the question which is often asked is why the shapley supercluster is located in the same region as the sloan great wall. the density of this region suggests that it is either the densest of its size, or the most extreme object in the entire sphere centered on our galaxy. we explore several methods for estimating the masses of such extreme objects, and apply them to two of them to determine their masses. we first show that the mass of the total mass can be estimated using an excursion set method. this method requires an estimate of the relation between the overdensity in linear theory and the actual nonlinear overdensity @xmath0, which can be inferred from the overabundance of rich clusters. we use the values derived from this method on a sample of 19 nearby x - ray clusters with known redshifts. a catalog of these clusters is provided, which allows us to estimate their total masses and to compare them with the mass estimates of their constituent groups. we find that only 5 out of the 18 known members of these 19 clusters have mass estimates larger than 0.2@xmath1. therefore, we conclude that they are not bound to the system. we also use a percolation analysis to define the largest structure in the region, and show that it contains at least 6 other extremely massive objects, all of which are expected to be extreme in origin. we argue that the existence of an object this massive is difficult to explain, not only from a lack of knowledge of the mass distribution, but also from a deficiency of accurate mass estimates. we discuss how these two - methods compare favorably with recent results from numerical simulations of structure formation, and how they can be used together to answer the question ` why'the amount of mass expected for such an extreme object can not be explained by simple gaussian initial conditions. the analysis of a third extreme object, the sdss galaxy, also suggests that this region is over - abundant in clusters, which argues against the possibility that the original density fluctuation fields were gaussian.
we report the results of 2-d ( axisymmetric ) hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of strong radiation - driven agn winds from a central part ( @xmath0 pc ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ). we have adopted a self - consistent model for the accretion onto the central part of agn in which the mass inflow rate is coupled to the total accretion luminosity ( or equivalently the eddington luminosity ). this provides a useful information on the dependence of the mass outflow rate on the mass supplied by the infalling gas. we find that the outflow is dominated by a strong outflow along the line of sight towards the equatorial plane ( ldot ) and by a weaker outflow close to the polar axis ( on the antinodal axis ). the magnitude of the ldot is sensitive to the variation of the disc accretion rate through the model inner boundary. in particular, when the radius of the central and spherical x - ray emitting corona coincides with the inner boundary, we observe a strong positive ( negative ) correlation between the mass- and mass - outflow rates. this correlation is much stronger for the radiatively - driven solutions than for the geometrically - thin disc solutions, and is particularly strong when the disc is optically thick. because the radial outflow velocity field is much weaker in the latter case, we identify the latter as the source of radiative pressure on the gas, and consider the possibility that the radiation pressure can be produced in the corona through its radiative output as well. we also examine the degree of gas self - consistently included in the simulations of outflows from agn. for the most consistent solution, we found that the ratio of the radiation - pressure to the magnetic pressure at the coronal boundary in the form of a wind is required to relax to a steady state in both the non - spherical and spherical accretion with an outflow. the corresponding free - fall time for our outflow model is estimated to be about 3.5 gyr.

we analyse the @xmath0-factorised resummation of the gluon anomalous dimension formula in the small-@xmath1 hierarchy, and show that it provides a more transparent explanation of the scheme - changeover to second order in the renormalisation - scale as well as a means for calculating the running coupling regime of the perturbative infrared ( ir ) fixed point. in this context, we provide a comparison of the results of the new scheme with those obtained by using the cteq and mrst @xcite non - zero - order factorisation schemes. in particular, we show that the bfkl - like residuals obtained by the sn2x - interpolation procedure are still of relevance in the limit of small @xifferences, but that the scheme change itself provides a new twist in the taylor expansion, which may turn out to be of independent interest in the ir limit. at the same time, this scheme change may introduce a newscenario of the leading - order perturbation theory in the strongly coupled regime. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm in recent work, we have proposed a series of non - trivial, leading - to - significant, non - abelian gauge invariance ( rgi ) corrections to the anomalous dimensional schrdinger equation in an attempt to understand the realski - friedner - kaluza - klein ( rks ) hamiltonian. in a part of these corrections is due to the presence of an on - shell anisotropy, which was recently found to be a very useful approximation for describing the radiative - kinetic - energy distribution of the cosmological neutrino background. the main result of this work is a factorisation formula for the gammam functional, which takes proper account of the infinite ir evolution and the resulting infinite terms in the rgi equation, and which is therefore expected to provide a new, rigorous insight into nonlinear dynamics of the gevino - string theory. by using some words we are able to generalise the well - known, well - studied rgi - related splitting functions in zero and one - dimensional ( 1d ) gauge theory to 2d and higher dimensions, and to factorise the scheme changings in these two cases as well, which might have some advantages in relation to the actual values of the relevant coefficients. in the following, we will use the framework of res
we present a new model for the evolution of the mass and density profiles of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes, based on a specific ab initio model of galaxy formation that has already been shown to successfully reproduce a wide range of observational data on galaxy properties. we take the well - established semi - analytic galaxy formation scheme of cole et al. ( 2000 ), and use it to predict the energy injection into the intracluster medium resulting from supernova explosions in the progenitor halos, and calculate the response of the gas profile to this heating. this allows us to explain the observed shallow present - day temperature - luminosity relation for clusters of galaxies, and the observed flattening of the t - l relation at high redshifts. we argue that the heating can be linked to supernova heating if the efficiency with which the supernova explosion energy is transferred to the diffuse gas in the halo is very high, or if the stellar initial mass function is tilted to produce an overabundance of high - mass stars relative to the imf in the solar neighbourhood. alternatively, heat input from agn activity may be required. in order to model the expected evolution of galaxy properties, we apply the model to study the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters and groups. we compare the predicted evolution predicted by the model with the currently available observations of intermediate redshift clusters, and also with a simple scaling model of cold dark matter cosmology. we find that if the heating is associated with supernovae and the cluster formation is accounted for in a self - consistent manner, then the predicted slope and normalization of the @xmath0/@xmath1 relation are in good agreement with observations. if, instead, the energy budget is limited by the constraints imposed by the available data, then there is a discontinuity in the predicted properties of clusters at a given temperature, and this may explain why the observed correlation between x - rays and gas temperature is found to be significantly shallower than predicted in the simple, adiabatic solution. supernova energy injection is also required to remove a potential cooling gap between the hot and cool gas in groups and clusters that has recently been suggested by kaiser ( 1986 ). the model therefore predicts for each dark halo both the total mass of baryons in galaxies and the total number of supernova events that have occurred in galaxies in that halo and through merger histories generated by a monte carlo scheme. galaxies : formation galaxies : clusters :
we explore the generality of scaling laws which characterize the global structure of urban street networks, and we show that they are consistent with the historical evolution of cities in the united states and in california. using a unique dataset recording the evolution of urban areas of greater london between 1786 and 2010, we find that the total area of urban networks scales approximately linearly with the number of intersections for a given network, reflecting the fact that cities grow up along different evolutionary paths. on the other hand, their city boundaries, as defined via the condensation threshold, do not seem to bear any resemblance with the urbanised space. we define city boundaries with a methodology that is parameter free and that reduces the problem to a simple clustering process on a spatial point pattern. regarding the quantification of the above mentioned allometries, we analyse a few simple global statistical properties of the spatial urban networks : the total street length @xmath0, measured in meters, which is the sum of the lengths of the street segments for each network ; the area @xfig. ( _ p - value=0.007 _ ), describing the extent of the urban area ; the total square meter area embedded in the network, measuring in square meters, representing the area enclosed by the street network ; and the street intersection density, obtained by imposing a 400 meters side square grid on top of the surface of the network. we demonstrate that all these properties are consistently different from the ones found in rural street networks. in particular, an ill posed definition of boundaries, such as arbitrary administrative boundaries, would mix the properties of street networks that are in two distinct phases of their evolution, producing spurious results. whereas distances and allometric exponents that we derive from our study are compatible with those found for the growth of london during the last two centuries, the behaviour of the total urban area in the uk is consistent with a linear behaviour. in contrast, for the smaller scale of the studied here, i.e. for the rural network in the outskirts of the city in the lower karliner urban area, we consistently find a different behaviour statistically significant for the same quantity, highlighting how the city is an overall homogeneous structure in terms of its street network quantities. both datasets present a variety of different phenomena of different scale for city networks, that can not be explained by a single parameter. several scaling laws that characterize different aspects of urban morphology and that are associated to the verhulst model and gibrat s law are also found in this work
we analyze a set of 151 qsos and 906 ly-@xmath0forest absorption lines with redshifts from @xmath1 in order to study the proximity effect in the low redshift intergalactic medium. the qso and star - forming galaxy contributions to the background are given as a function of redshift and wavelength. we perform the analysis by omitting and including only spectra that show associated absorption and damped ly-=1 absorption, and compare our results with previous observations. the mean and standard model of the uv background in terms of simple gaussian integrals is in good agreement with the observed range of values for both the mean intensity of the background and the range of measured values of the maximum likelihood of clustering. we find that the full hst / fos archival data set is also suitable as a qso systemic redshift indicator, so we also opt to use that data set for the study of proximity effect. in addition, spectra showing the commonly used mgii or balmer emission lines are included in the analysis. our analysis does not rely on the fluorescent or [ oiii ] emission lines, which are often used to detect redshift indicators at higher redshift. by considering only emission lines with blueshifted systemic fluxes, we are able to determine the best matching civ and civ line densities, equivalent widths, and column density in the framework of the single power law model of dav et al. ( 1999 ). while we agree that most systematic effects, including galaxy clustering, will lead to a overestimate of the probability density of compton lines by up to a factor of 5 - 10, the relatively simple proximity effect analysis shows that these effects do not significantly bias the results. as a consequence, the mean value of the enriched qso rest frame column density, obtained from the redshift analysis, is found to increase with redshift, and hence, the inferred qso clustering effect, at least partially, due to this increase in the number density of lines. = 1.0 cm = cmr5 = cmbx5 = cmti5 psfig.tex # 1 # 1to 0pt#1
we present optical spectroscopy and photometry of 17 red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the most metal - rich ( log o / h+12=9.0 ) of any of the local group galaxies ( m31 ). the spectra were obtained with the longspec spectrograph on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( mmt ). sixteen of these are m - type stars, 16 of which are newly discovered rsgs. we use the @xmath0 colors of these stars to determine effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities, and find that the effective temperature of m31 rsgs is on average slightly warmer than that of their galactic counterparts, with a mean difference of 20@xmath1 k. in contrast, the lmc and smc rsgs have similar temperatures, by about 100 k and 170 k, while the latter are cooler by about 250 k and 500 k, respectively. this difference is smaller than previously measured, and in agreement with what was found when using the optical spectra ( albeit with considerable uncertainty ) or assuming a flatter metallicity scale for rsgs in the magellanic clouds. this is the opposite of the problem that was previously found in the milky way, where strong tio absorption lines are found at 6000 and the tio bands become strong at temperatures much warmer than the galactic range. we also explore using the accurate continuum shape of the stars, supplemented with the continuum flux from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ), to determine the absorption line strengths and proper motions, in order to measure radial velocities and to compare the physical properties of our stars to those predicted by stellar evolution theory. the new data combined with similar data available in the literature for m31 show that the distribution of the red stars is more uniform than has been found in previous works, suggesting that circumstellar dust is responsible for much of the color difference between rsgs and blue stars. in particular, our analysis of one of the intriguing new objects we found, j004047.84 + 405602.6 ( = m2 i ), points to a relatively smooth distribution of red stars in m31, which is not dominated by the rsgs or their progenitors, but rather a collection of foreground stars. however, the distribution is consistent with that seen in some other star - forming galaxies ( primarily the smc and lmc ).
we have revisited the measurement of the luminosity and effective temperature of ab dor c, which was claimed by @xcite for the first direct detection of a companion to a nearby young low - mass star ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) within the stellar wing of the stellar primary stellar body. we have retrieved the naco archive data for this object from the eso archive and have performed an independent analysis based on the simultaneous differential imaging mode ( sdi ) of images taken with the nasmyth adaptive optics system ( naos ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ). we find that the sdi data provide a unique new test of the relative astrometry and photometric errors inherent to high contrast, low - contrast photometry in the observations of this object. after applying a star - forming region - wide background extinction ( ssb - d ) template to our combined naco / vlt images, we measure a point - like object to lie at a distance of 0.66 pc, a distance significantly higher than that implied by the hertzsprung - russell ( mg ) diagram, and a luminosity at and near the center of the main sequence that is consistent with that of an early - type star. we classify the object as spectral type of m5-m6 using the dwarf standards obtained with spex and the spexspec instrument at the nasa infrared telescope facility. the spectral type we derive from the broad - band photometry and the intermediate - resolution spectroscopy is inconsistent with the type of previous determinations of m7, m8, and m8.5, suggesting that many of the objects previously identified as brown dwarfs in open clusters are instead low - massive stars. we also present a detailed analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic errors in the data obtained by chen et al. ( 2005 ), including all the data that they obtained with ao and spex. using both the irac - m and naco - d photometry, we find an approximately 1.4 - 2.1 mag brighter than the values given by the models of von alfthan, but consistent with the salpeter ( 2003 ) imf for the younger pleiades open cluster. we measure an effective temperature that is 1.04 - 1.05 k. however, the model uncertainties in the absolute magnitude of the object are too large to account for the difference in effective temperature between the two objects. we therefore derive an upper limit on
the pursuit for extra - solar planets began in earnest in the early 1980s with the promise of measuring the motion of distant extrasolar planets from the wavelength of the microwave emission lines of their parent stars. the initial indications of a planetary companion to one of the giant stars in a binary system provided by telluric emission lines provided the initial evidence. by the time the planetary companion was found, the observational effort was almost complete and the precise radial velocity ( prv ) measurements were beginning to become available. with the advent of digital tv cameras in the mid eighties, it was possible for the first time to follow up many of the stars with high precision measurements of their radial velocities. it was then possible to programme radial velocity measurements over many decades and verify that the exoplanet companion to the primary star was indeed causing the ` discontinuities'in the stellar radial velocity curve. during this time, unlike astrometry, the hartree fahlman and glaspey developed the technique of using plexiglass photometry to measure the semi - angular reflex displacement of the parent star on a planetary orbit caused by a companion. while the orbital period of the exo - planet was 7.36 @xmath0 yr, with a semimajor axis of 19 au, postulated by @xcite, the post - keplerian periodicity of the planet caused by the companion made the ex - solar system the best candidate for a planet progenitor. we have been fortunate to be in a correspondence with the first reports of planetary separations from other stars in our own galaxy and to observe the tails of the planetary distribution. having established such a highly eccentric orbit, our own has proven to be the most stable host system for a jovian companion. we are grateful to have been able to live vicariously to the end of an extraordinary run of stellar observations that stretched over nearly 10 years.

we demonstrate on - chip frequency conversion from the 980 nm band to the 1550 nm wavelength band via four - wave - mixing bragg scattering in silicon nitride waveguides. at 980 nm, we use two pumps to convert a single quantum dot ( inas ) single photon source to its telecom - band idler, and a tapered amplifier to convert photons from that source to other single photon sources ( n@xmath0s, cesium, nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, and iras quantum dots ). while the conversion efficiency is limited by noise due to raman scattering, with pump powers in the range @xmath1 mw, obtained via optimized geometries, we show that strong pump fields can be placed in regions of normal dispersion, to avoid the onset of modulation instability. using results from split - step fourier simulations, we further show that simple variations in the waveguide geometry can enable downconversion between the 637 nm, 780 nm, and 850 nm wavelength bands to be connected to the1550 nm band. as the demonstrated conversion efficiencies are low ( @xiff2 mw ) due to relatively low pump power used ( @xcite ), we discuss how these results may be incorporated into proposed integrated circuits that enable down(up)conversion of photons from various quantum emitters via frequency conversion in the cmos - compatible chip. 10 t. erdogan, ` ` block - prototyping technology for silicon - based photonic quantum networks, '' j. lightwave technol. * 24*(12 ), 4750 ( 2007 ). c. j. mckinstrie, p. r. villeneuve, y. yamamoto, m. bose, a. e. lita, and y. nakahata ( ` ` nanophotonics and quantum computing, '' in ` ` proceedings of the ieee 2006 international conference on computers, systems, and signal processing, '' ( 2006 ), pp. 7578. d. richardson, j. horwath, and k. srinivasan ( eds., optics and photonics, new york, 1996 ). i. k. eisenstein and i. a. walmsley i. l. chuang + university of michigan, ann arbor, mi 48109 - 1040, u.s.a. + http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/09500340
we present a catalog of candidate infrared counterparts to x - ray sources in the central @xmath0 of the galaxy. we have cross - correlated the _ chandra _ acis - i data with 23 deep pointings toward the arches and quintuplet regions, the sgr b and sgr c h ii regions, and the galactic center h ii region to search for red and blue infrared counterparts. a total of 650 sources are found with infrared counterparts in our catalog, of which 656 are likely real counterparts based on the approximate photometric parallax method. the catalog includes spectroscopically - matched point - source candidates from recent spectroscopic follow - up observations, as well as unattenuated point - like sources from the _ spitzer_/irac surveys. the probability distribution of the number of matches is log - normal in the 0.58.0 kev energy range, with an average of 60 % across the entire sample. although accidental coincidences dominate the sample, we find a significant number of real counterparts whose photometric redness and intrinsic color are consistent with those expected for objects associated with luminous stars. in the case of the majority of candidates, the probability for a true, bright blue infrared counterpart to a hard source is only 3.8 %, but they contribute nearly 40 % to the total. the true number of bright red infrared matches is, however, considerably higher : at least 350 of the 696 blue infrared matches have a color consistent with a star with the type i ( agn ) spectral type of cvs. most of these matches are associated with the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( cvs ), although a significant minority are likely to be due to foreground agn. in addition, several hundred of the blue matches have colors consistent with young stars of lower mass, bringing the total number of known cvs in this region to about 850. we discuss our results in the context of massive star formation in the inner galaxy, and conclude that massive stars likely contribute significantly to the number and energy content of the observed cvs, as a whole.
we use published radio observations of the starburst galaxies m33, ngc 253, and ngc 6946 to identify new candidate ultracompact ultradense h regions ( udhs ). we search for sources with positive radio spectral indices ( @xmath0 ) implying an optically thick free - free origin. we identify five sources in m33 that appear to be significantly enshrouded in their radio emission due to thermal bremsstrahlung emission from young massive stars. we use published 6 and 20 cm observations of m33 to further identify positive spectral indices and lower limits on the number of inbound ionizing stars that could be associated with these sources. we find that the four previously identified sources are all positive radio sources, while the newly identified source in n253 is only marginally less luminous and has an ionizing star fraction in excess of unity. we also use the observed spectral energy distribution of the five m33 sources to estimate their physical sizes, densities, masses, and ages. the estimates of their ages and physical properties are all significantly smaller than those of the old globular clusters that dominate this galaxy. in fact, the sizes of the regions are typically a few parsecs and stellar masses are within a factor of ten of those expected for young massive clusters. our results imply that the formation of massive star clusters in the centers of starbursts is a relatively short - lived phenomenon, likely involving a small fraction of the massive star lifetime. based on the ages and densities of the observed regions, we suggest that these regions are formed at relatively early times in the evolution of a single massive star cluster, during the period of very low mass star formation activity. the associated star formation rate is similar to that in the milky way, and is likely driven by the similar star formation process in that galaxy. the combined radio and photometric properties of the ultra - young clusters imply that these clusters are being born inside the densest regions of this galaxy during the early epoch of galaxy evolution.
we present the results of the investigation of the gaseous distribution and kinematics in the inner 450pc radius of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy mrk766 ( ngc4253 ) a barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 60.6mpc. the observations were obtained using the gemini near infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) operating with the adaptive optics system altair in the programme gn-2010a - q-42, following the standard sky - object - sky dither sequence. the achieved signal - to - noise ratio allows the mapping of the gas velocity field in the plane of the galaxy, and in particular in the vicinity of the nucleus. the nir spectrum is well described by a gas dominated by the cold h@xmath0 gas, with abundances of permited lines of hi, hei, heii and feii, and by forbidden lines of [ sii ], [ siii ] and [ feii ]. the hst images show an irregular dust filament around the nucleus, suggestive of the presence of recent star formation. the total mass of the molecular gas in this galaxy is 2.2@xcite. the ratio of low - ionization nuclear emission lines ( liners ) is in the range @xmath1 0.1 - 2.0, while for starbursts the values are larger than 0.6 and for liners the ratio is larger than 2. the ionized gas, traced by the hi recombination lines and the e - coli emission lines, presents a complex kinematic structure, with redshifts ranging from 3.4 to 4.1 and blueshifts from 1.7 to 3.9. the kinematical data shows evidence for rotation in the direction of the radio jet, and a velocity gradient along the outflow axis, interpreted as due to inflows along the bar. the virial mass derived from the ionization line ratios [ oiii ] @xcite, [ neii ] @x mathprosper[nii ] = logarithm[m / fe ] @xi ] and ( s+ s+c+n+ss+ss ) = 1.0 to 1.4, with an effective temperature of 800k, below the temperature of 30k, in agreement with previous studies. the derived velocity field shows features that could be associated with the bar, including a blueshifted component with a large pah 3.3@x
we review our current understanding of the secular evolution of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ), including the currently accepted model for the 2 - 3 hr period gap in the orbital period distribution. then we present results from a population synthesis study of cvs in which the binary parameters of the cvs at all phases of their evolution are explored. specifically we show that the effects of thermal bloating on the mass of the donor stars in cvs for orbital periods just above the gap are qualitatively similar for all four models. we therefore advocate high signal - to - noise, orbital phase - resolved, near- and mid - ir spectroscopic observations with large ground - based telescopes ( e.g., gemini, keck ) of sources such as the brightest nls and other cvs which have @xmath0 hr. finally, we discuss some specific observational implications arising from our theoretical work. = cvs are stellar objects that have undergone a great deal of evolution during the past few decades. these epochs include the start of mass transfer, changes in the stellar composition, and in - situ magnetic braking of the secondary. while most workers believe in the existence of the period gap ", a few ( especially ) have questioned its reality, especially when all types of cv are considered. however, we adress some of the problems that have beset previous attempts to identify the true period gap, and emphasize that the ambiguity of the equation of state ( o(r ) ) can lead to considerable confusion in assigning the correct period gap to a cv. we also show that, in the spectral - type-@xmath1 plane, the zero - age cvs with measured spectral types lie below the expected relation for main - sequence stars ( i.e., they are cooler at a fixed value of @xhot1 ). furthermore, we find that the binary evolution can substantially alter the empirical relationships between mass, radius, and orbital period that have been established for cvs. we argue therefore that a significant fraction of stable cvs may indeed have secondaries which are older than 1/3 of the main sequence lifetimes prior to the onset of massive transfer.
we present detailed calculations of the properties of the soft x - ray emission lines from photoionized accretion discs in the spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies. the specific models used are based on the _ asca _ reflection grating spectrometer data of mcg6 - 30 - 15, and the _ xmm - newton _ reflection spectrum of mrk 766. background ionization models are used to determine the strength and equivalent width of the c, n and o lines, and to investigate the disc structure and ionization state under the assumption that the surface of the accretion disc is a constant density slab. based on these calculations, we find that the o viii line is expected to be weak and broad, with a relative width of 40 per cent that of the fe k@xmath0 line. models with a range of ionization parameters are studied and the following implications are obtained : ( 1 ) if the o emission originates from a region close to the disc, ews @xmath1 1 - 5 times solar, then the strongest lines from this region should be broadened due to relativistic blurring effects, and therefore should be detectable. ( 2 ) if this region of the parameter space is closer to the innermost 0.5 thomson depth of the atmosphere, then an oxfordshire overabundance of o is required to explain the relative fwhm of lines from nitrogen and oxygen, consistent with the observations of @xcite. ( 3 ) it is unlikely that a single o line will produce such a line, unless there is an abundance of the more abundant n with respect to solar values, and even then, the line will be very weak if produced in the o emitting region. ( 4 ) the c line in the reflection spectrum has a minimum width which is ten per cent of the o line width, regardless of the assumed constant density structure. thus, if the c and n lines are indeed due to emission from the agn, then observations of that line will place a constraint on the amount of accretion energy that is released in the corona. ( 5 ) the strongest o lines from the ionized gas are predicted to be broad and weak, although they are not strong enough to be detectable with current instruments. however, the use of ionized disc models should allow better constraints to be placed on the disc ionization parameter than the constant density ones. agn : active galaxies : nuclei x - rays : galaxies accretion, acc
we demonstrate that quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are a promising alternative to the traditional quantum chemistry methods for the correct description of diradical molecules, and that using these methods constitutes a fundamental step for using qmc in order to have an accurate and computationally feasible description of several chemical processes of biological interest like the thermal isomerization of the retinal chromophore in the mechanism of vision. the accuracy of qmc calculations based on the jastrow correlated antisymmetrized geminal power ( jagp ) is explicitly described, with specific attention to the determination of formal analogies with standard molecular orbital theories for two benchmark systems : the ethylene ( c@xmath0h://xmath1 ) and the methylene ( ch=x ). we show that the agp framework is suitable for the description of the electronic structure of such an important molecule. we describe the evolution of the shubnikov - singlet - triplet ( sst ) order parameter, the torsional barrier of the orthogonally twisted ethylene and of the singlet triplet gap of methylene, using the fully variational method of burkatzki _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. b * 85 *, 194102 ( 2008 ) ]. the jagsp ansatz is shown to be intrinsically multiconfigurational, and to be able to provide a fast and accurate description of multi - electron systems with large number of electrons. it leads to an improvement of the static correlation, comparable with that of the single slater determinant [ j. chem. phys. j. b * 82 *, 2454 ( 2005 ) ; a. s. oneill, f. j. garcia - vidal and l. martin, eds., proc. r. soc. lond. a * 79 *, 209222 ( 2007 ) ], http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s037015731400387100057006889. m. a. salem and f. rowland, ` ` a model for molecular torsion, '' nature * 452 *, 7881 ( 2004 ). c. kuramoto, m. bayvel, e. serebryannikov, and y. shih, _ theory of resonating valence bonds _ ( john wiley & sons, london, 2000 ). l. i. stock
we study the evolution of protostars accreting at very low rates, @xmath0, and we show that protostellar growth proceeds through a phase of rapid expansion. at the high accretion rate defined by the eddington limit, radiation pressure onto the dust shell surrounding a protostar becomes important and limits the amount of matter that can be accreted. the contribution to the total luminosity provided by nuclear reactions of deuterium and hydrogen ( through the cn - cycle ) is larger than in the case of a spherically symmetric accretion. as the accret rate increases, the opacity in the envelope decreases through the outer layers, the matter behind the accretion front moves outward as a luminosity wave, and the kelvin - helmholtz contraction. accretion is halted before the maximum mass of the forming object, at which stage the radiative mass loss leads to the onset of a powerful stellar wind. in this phase, very massive objects ( e.g. supernovae or massive stars ) can form, provided that there is sufficient material in the parent clumps to allow a transient internal readjustement. for higher accretion rates, on the other hand, further accretion can continue unimpeded by radiation pressure. we give an estimate to the expected number of planets formed in such extreme environments and to the number of objects which could have collapsed without entering the phase of violent expansion. thus, the problem of making very massive stars is still open. # 1#2#3 _ ann. rev. astron. astrophys. _ * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1= cmr5 = cmr7 = cmti7 = cmmib10 scaled1 = cmsy10 = cmbx10 = cmtt10 = msl10 = mtmib10 psfig.tex _ note : this paper has been accepted for publication in the physical review d as of june 2002. _ the following article has been submitted to the astrophysical journal. _ address = astronomical institute, vrije universiteit brussel, pleinlaan 2, 1050 brussels, belgium.
we study the weighted sum - rate maximization problem for the downlink transmission in a fully cooperative multi - cell system equipped with a central processing unit ( e.g., a dedicated control station or a preassigned bs ) which has the global knowledge of transmit messages for all the bss in the network and downlink channels from each bs to all the multispan transmit operators ( mss ). for this setup, the bd precoding design problem is formulated in an auxiliary miso / mimo bremsstrahlung ( or miso bc ) with the number of transmitting antennas equal to the sum of those from the three bss. as in prior works @xcite, this paper applies a set of transmit power constraints, which are assumed to be the same as that for the conventional sum - power constraint case, i.e., the precoding vectors corresponding to the unitary decoding matrix ( or the pseudo - inverse of the miso - bc channel matrix ) are known for each transmitter. then, per - antenna power constraints are applied to design the orthogonal bare - differential downlink precoder design for this scheme, which is a low - complexity suboptimal design with an optimal power allocation to meet the per - bs power constraints. we show that for this case, the zf - bf precoding matrix is able to transform the general markov chain monte carlo ( m - pc ) channel matrix into a more general nonlinear form, which reduces the problem to a closed - form expression. we formulate as a special case the optimal bd convergence - differential precoding ( mse ) optimal linear precoder with full - amplitude - line ( or line - to - beamforming ), in the markovian approximation, and derive an upper bound on the maximum number of bss transmitting with their full power levels for this optimization problem. the proposed solution for the special case of single - antenna bss and mss is compared with existing ones in the literature, based on approaches such as the generalized channel matrix inverse and the semi - definite programming ( sdp ) with rank - one relaxation. moreover, we also develop a new algorithm to solve ( p1 ), which can transform the @xmath0-dimensional pre - chosen mse - matrix into parallel interference - free scalar sub - channels for different mss. power allocation optimization, precoding, downlink beamforming, miso bf, mimo bc, nonlinear transmit power,
we present a chemical composition analysis of seven marginal am stars ( am stars ) in the _ kepler _ field, aimed at obtaining accurate values for their fundamental astrophysical parameters, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, rotational and microturbulent velocities, and chemical abundances. with the aim of speeding up the spectroscopic investigation of the target stars, we estimated stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) with selected model atmosphere. we also investigated the abundance pattern in our sample, with a particular focus on the chemical composition of iron - peak and heavy elements. the analysis highlighted a general chemical pattern typical of am stars, namely underabundance of calcium, with overabundances of calcium ( @xmath0(0.5@xmath1/10 ) dex ) and scandium ( zirconium and barium ). oxygen, one of the most abundant elements, was found to show a slight excess in the stellar atmosphere, in agreement with previous studies. for the three targets that were analyzed with a previous paper, namely hd43509, hd52403, and hd185658, we derived upper limits on the oxygen abundances of 0.771, 0.014 and 0.0770, respectively. in addition, we found slight excesses of magnesium, silicon, barium and nickel. we interpreted these results in the framework of the models by @xcite, in which it is assumed that the am stars are members of binary systems and that the variations in their atmospheric abundances are due to the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration. + * key words : * stars : abundances stars : ag stars : chemically peculiar stars : evolution stars : oscillations stars : pre - main - sequence stars : individual : hd10933 am stars : mass stars : rotational / hertzsprung - russel * a first version of the present paper has been accepted for publication in the physical review d.c.
charge ripples observed in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments for fe layers on w(001 ) surface are ferromagnetic and appear as an increasing number of quantum well states with increasing layer thickness. these states are mostly of a majority - spin type, but for 3 ml fe / w(100 ) we find that surface states and resonant states also occur. these surface states are found to be strongly amplified along the @xmath0 directions in the two - dimensional ( 001 ) brillouin zone. the effect of the proximity of the states to the fermi energy is discussed and possible spin - filtering of the oscillations are pointed out. the results are compared to those obtained from the minority - spin states studied experimentally. during the last years it has become experimentally possible to study charge ripples in the surface layers of fe up to distances larger than 1 nm from the impurities. this can lead to a new way of controlling the magnetic properties of thin films by means of stm measurements. as a first step in this direction, lately much attention has been devoted to the study of the low - energy behavior of fe films on substrates in the presence of impurities @xcite. although the overall trend is quite similar to that of metals, especially with respect to fe, the coupling of magnetic layers is more complicated as compared to their higher energy counterparts. nevertheless, the ability to control this very effectively the charge oscillations is quite useful in that it allows to design very large and long - ranged magnetic properties, e.g. increasing the layer thickness, which may lead to new avenues for the control of magnetic properties. developing experimental techniques to control or de - gate effects on thin films is an issue that is expected to be of great importance for the future development of spintronic devices. in this regard, it is very important to understand the large amplitude charge density oscillations that appear in the experiments. here we point out that these oscillations, usually taken as a part of the friedel screening, actually arise from a quantum well ( qw ) state of the fe films. the qws are localized in the overlayer and only propagate in certain directions, hence the observed large amplitudes. however, because of the confinement effects in fe films, qws of different qws can coexist but are not directly coupled to each other. this results in the possibility to create new modes of excitations, that are forbidden to occur in metallic systems. moreover, because no energy barrier appears between
the cmb anisotropies are the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy on scales of @xmath0 that are observable on cobe - scale. the precise timing and location of the first acoustic peaks in the cmb spectrum are still debated and must be verified independently of inflation, which is implying that they are superluminally outside the apparent horizon. the acoustic peaks themselves are interpreted as the first in a series of acoustic peaks generated by the recombination of primordial photons. each of these peaks differs from the others in a way that signals its inflationary origin. lower _ ab initio _ limits on the total density ( or gravitational potentials ) are expected to be relatively robust provided that the matter density is low. however inflation, with its low matter density, requires a special epoch for every mode that synchs up. if this criterion is crossed, the inflationary models are found to be unique in their phenomenology and must somehow manage to explain the subsequent rise in density and momentum of the underlying dark matter. we discuss the theoretical implications of these observations for precision cosmology tests. we also make the case for the need for cmb polarization at large angles in order to constrain the cosmological redshift and the evolution of the primordial density fluctuations. in the case of the second acoustic peak, polarization will be the ideal tool to determine the epoch of transition from inflationary to isocurvature fluctuations. cmb predictions for the future are reviewed and a roadmap is provided for critical tests in the coming decade. # 1 # 2 _ mem. soc. astron. it. _ * # 1 *, # 2 # 1 = cmr5 = cmb_#1 # 2 -12.1 in.25 in = -0.5 in # 1to 0pt#1
the results of integrated spectroscopic evolution of padova stellar populations are presented. they cover a wide range of ages, metallicities, star formation rates, stellar masses, ages, ultraviolet colors and star - spectrum properties as well as their variation with star - formation rate and chemical composition. the results are compared with the observations and with theoretical models and stellar evolution computations by padova ( 1995 ). for the single - generation populations, the results cover the following evolutionary stages : passive evolution from the first @xmath0 to the present epoch, from around 0.1 to 5 years after the big bang, from 0.03 to 0.015, with star formation intensities, colors and spectral indices mostly determined by metallicity. for populations with continuous star formation, the duration of star formation is between 1 and 5 gy, with the intensity and color of the star formation becoming more and more red at later epochs. for those in the active phase of evolution with time - count set - in the 1 to 5 gy range, most of the spectral evolution is contributed by massive stars reaching the main sequence shortly after formation. the reddest limiting case for both the spectral and color evolution is that of the passive population with its initial blue luminosities much higher than two decades ago, but remained for most of that period mainly constrained to solar composition. presently there do exist two consistent track sets for different metallicities of the padova tracks, one set for 6 compositions produced by geneva group and the other for 4 non - solar compositions. the choice of the functional form parameter is almost unavoidable for the latter being quite insensitive to the age of the population. spectral evolution of the active population is rather red and smooth, with its colors and spectrum being close to that of a passive population at the same age, 5 gy. though both the colors and the spectrum are redder than those of the corresponding passive populations, no impressive changes next to its absolute decrease are evident, even though the uv - branch keeping nearftp lypxes and bolometric corrections for star formation have not drastically changed. as a result of the continuing star formation at the later evolutionary stages and/or with luminosity levels differing from those in earlier stages of evolution, the population sizes have not converged to a few kpc. galaxies : abundances, galaxies : evolution - galaxies : active - quasars : general - infrared : galaxies
we develop a simple model for the formation of massive elliptical galaxies using a combination of a dust - enshrouded starburst and a multi - zone chemo - hydrodynamic model for a collapsing gas spheroid. the model predicts the time evolution of gas, dust and the stellar population of the galaxy as a whole, but also allows us to set constraints on the growth and fueling of a central black hole by tracking the rate at which gas is deposited into the central 100 pc of the host. the predictions of this model at sub - millimeter wavelengths are then compared with the results of the sub - mm study of radio galaxies in. the key stages of formation as predicted by the model are described in detail. we show that the dust mass peaks when the galaxy is approximately half formed, with the final stellar mass reaching @xmath0 at the epoch of emission. even though half of the stars are formed very rapidly, it is shown that star formation persists in the host at some level for more than a gyr. as a result, the hosts of massive black holes at high redshift are very different to the relatively passive elliptical hosts of low - redshift agn. we argue that the total _ mass _ of dust ( and hence gas ) stored in dust is expected to be much greater than that of the star - formation rate in the typical host at epochs 0.1 - 0.3 gyr, suggesting that the buildup of a massive black hole can proceed without invoking a direct causal connection to black - hole emission. this is consistent with observations of the coeval evolution of the x - ray luminosity in well - observed massive galaxies. the multi - wavelength evolution of galaxy luminosity provides a possible explanation for the relatively low redshifts of most deep multi - frequency selected radio galaxies. despite this potential limitation of the model, we feel that the predicted redshift evolution is already confirmed by the observed ratio of the optical - to - infrared luminosity of the objects observed in the current scuba survey. finally, the model indicates that the expected output of powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is a strong function of redshift, with a predicted peak in agn output coinciding with that of seyferts and quasars. this supports the idea that the output of agn activity can be used to constrain the initial state of star formation and quasar formation.

we report on the @xmath0-ray observations of the tev - peaked, high - synchrotron - peaked bl lac object markarian501 ( mrk501 ) by the large area telescope ( lat ) instrument on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope, during its first 16 months of operation. this is the most extensive study to date of the broadband emission of this object at gev - tev energies. the lat broadband spectrum ( covering an energy range of about 550 gev to 1 tev ) was measured with an accuracy of about 0.7 times that of the all - sky _ rxte_-asm data, and was fitted with a single power - law function. the measured average photon index changed from the hard photon index of @xcite ( for the first time ) down to the softest one of the recent observations ( the latter being on 2009 november 27 ), with the heaviest photon index consistent with the typical values measured by other observatories in the gev / tev region. flux variations between 0.2 and 0.4gev were clearly observed, as well as a marked decrease in the amplitude of the variability. an analysis of the overall broadband spectra reveals that the electron energy distribution, in particular the rising and falling energy components, is strongly affected by klein - nishina effects, which tend to steepen the high - energy tail of the spectral energy distribution. those effects are the only ones responsible for changing the photon index within the overlapping energy range between the instruments. the large improvement in the accuracy of the lat observations over those previous observations was demonstrated by measuring flux variations in a 30-day time interval, and a correlation was found between flux variations at energies above 0.3gev and x - rays. this result provides us with a new perspective on broadband blazars, from a broad perspective, in which both the physical mechanisms responsible for the radiation of radiating particles and the relativistic acceleration of the underlying plasma are considered.

we present the discovery of the first t dwarf + white dwarf binary system, which we confirm through common proper motion and spectroscopy. the spectra of the t dwarf are consistent with a cool white dwarf, showing no strong features in the spectrum blue - ward of 6000 and just a hint of h@xmath0. the energy distributions are not sensitive enough to surface gravity to constrain the value of @xmath1, and thus for white dwarfs with no parallax measurement it just seems to be a genuine binary. we also identify five candidate white dwarf companions to the t dwarfs in our sample, that are similar to the white dwarf sequence. however, we statistically assess the likelihood that two such objects could be a line - of - sight association with photometry and proper motion consistent with binarity by random chance. we thus conclude that this new system is spurious. the rest of the ukidss large area survey ( las ) includes the t2 - 3 dwarfs, 29 in the t4 - 6 range, sixteen t6 - 8 dwarfs and two t8 + dwarfs that we consider in our work. the sample spans the spectral type and distance range t2 to 9 and 12 - 80pc. this is comprised of two t2-3 dwarfs ( t4 + 6 ), 29 ( t6 + 8 ), and 2 ( 1.5 + 1.0 ) dwarfs for which we have not found spectroscopic verification. we perform our standard spectral model analysis of a t dwarf to determine the temperature, metallicity and gravity. the best fitting atmospheric model is a temperature of 1200k, a sub - solar metallicity, and a gravity of 400k. the measurements of the atmospheric properties of ulasj0717 - 0857 and j1459 + 0851 appear to be in general agreement with theoretical predictions, although they also seem to be significantly in excess of the main sequence mass. as the bulk of the bd population has been formed during the post main sequence evolutionary phase, we clearly must have a mass separation consistent with the current observed t dwarf population.

we present the results of photo/collisional ionization modeling of the @xmath0 strong absorber, which is thought to arise in a corona similar to that surrounding the milky way disk. from new data on the,,, and transitions obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on the keck i telescope, we place constraints on the physical properties of the system such as densities, temperatures, and sizes of the various environments that give rise to the absorption features displayed in the spectral profiles. to constrain our models, we use to model the optical part of the spectrum ( with 2853, 2796, 2803 and 2600 covered between 3723 and 2600 ). for each phase, we order the physical parameters of the gas to be consistent with the observations. we determine that the is under produced compared to the pure haardt and madau assumption. thus, it follows that any random line of sight passing through a galaxy is likely to encounter several phases of gas. we further determine the physical conditions of the surrounding gas using the and transitions. for the, we find that the low ionization gas properties ( density, temperature, and size of clouds ) characterize each of the phases. however, the high ionization absorption associated with the damped local background ( dla ) is not consistent with that of classic strong absorbers if it is produced in the same regions as the other phases. we conclude that a two phase model, with separate phases producing the and absorption, is the simplest suitable model that can fit both the and profiles and those of other intermediate ionization transitions. we also test the viability of broad, neutral and narrow components as partial phases in order to determine whether or not they can produce the strong absorption observed in the and lines. the broad component required to reproduce all the absorption is very broad, which suggests that it could be produced in a very large cloud that surrounds the galaxy. if such a cloud were to be formed, it could have a relatively low metallicity ( @xcite ). furthermore, it would have to be very small to be undetected in the 21-cm absorption profile of the dla toward b 0738 + 313. with some thermal scaling, the largest equivalent widths of the would then be expected to be the ones with the few components that produce the strongest absorption.
we discuss how the coulomb artifacts affect the determination of the heavy quarkonium spectrum from the lattice data. the analysis of the hyperfine splitting to @xmath0 is performed using the direct numerical matching as well as the asymptotic expansion about the continuum limit. both approaches lead to a systematic error in the inferred energy spectrum which is shown to be eliminated by extrapolation. the numerical effect of the spurious linear artifact is analyzed and the correct continuum limit determination is obtained. # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys. ( ny ) _ * # 1 * ( # 2 ) # 3. the energy spectrum of the lightest quark on a square lattice is determined by the application of an effective nonrelativistic perturbative action. the wilson coefficient obtained from the matching is used to determine the spin dependent part of the nrqcd lagrangian, which parameterizes the quark anomalous chromomagnetic moment and the effective local four - quark interaction. the result for the color - singlet energy spectrum is expressed in terms of the hubbard expansion coefficients @xcite. the ultraviolet momentum region is taken into account by the relativistic corrections. in the case of a vanishing lattice spacing, the results are compared with the bare results based on the nonperturbative qcd simulations. a good agreement is found between the two sets of results. the gauged energy spectrum exhibits a power enhanced behavior with respect to the bare data. this is attributed to the different effective theory cuts providing different long - range contributions in the high and low energy regions of the spectrum. the bottomonium splitting is investigated using the technique of constrained fit. it is found that the results obtained using the preferred lattice method suffer from the same magnitude of lattice artifacts as the nonlinear ones but are substantially smaller. the correct long - distance scaling is thus required to remove the artifacts. _ e.g. _ the vacuum expectation distribution of the energy at the energy scale of the minimal theory can be determined from the comparison of the bare and the improved lattice results.
he04502958 is a @xmath0 quasar with a nucleus that is interacting with a companion that is likely to be hidden behind a veil of dust. we present new near infrared and mid infrared images of the system, designed to localize the source(s ) of the ulirg emission. the host galaxy is clearly visible in the mid - infrared images, but is not directly detected in the optical. the companion is covered in optically thick dust, which makes the galaxy appear as a collisional ring galaxy in the near - infrared. going back to the optical and ir residuals, we find no co - centered host galaxy at a level above 3 % of the flux. the star formation in both components is likely powered by a single star, with upper limit star formation rates of 370 m@xmath1yr. however, our new images do not provide the necessary strength to force a qso host galaxy, leaving the interesting possibility that both components are powered by one star. the warm dust emission of the quasar nucleus and the bright star forming component of the companion are consistent with the current upper limit for black hole masses in galaxies, even if the bulge - to - disk ratio is accounted for. if we assume the ne - extension of the host is associated with the qso nucleus, we can reach a much higher redshift where the host becomes completely visible to the nucleus for the first time. this will allow us to measure and compare the black hole mass with other high redshift quasars, such as blsy1 and 2mass. the new data are combined with the previously published hst images and with visir data to solve the dust problem in the system and to better constrain the amount of dust in the nucleus. we find that the hot dust has to be a factor of 10 larger than the optical dust that could have prevented the optical detection. this raises the possibility that the high eddington accretion rate could be attained for this system.
we study the possibility of cosmic - ray ( cr ) magnetic instabilities producing non - linear amplification of magnetic fields in the upstream medium of galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks. it has been proposed that the magnetic field may be amplified by the crs themselves, as long as they propagate through the protostellar medium of snr shocks, via the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism. in this situation, near the shock, cosmic rays ( crs ) propagate through a plasma where previous magnetic turbulence, produced by the highest energy crs, has already been produced on scales larger than the typical cr larmor radius ( @xmath0 ). this situation is motivated by the fact that the crcd magnetic instability, in its current state, would be driven by purely growing, compressional waves that arise when the cr current is perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. we show that this new instability, the perpendicular current - driven instability ( pcdi ), grows non - linearly with the current parallel to the field. the time and length scale of growth of the pcdiv are similar to the ones of the cr cold - flow derivative instability ( ccd ), which has been identified as a viable mechanism for the generation of magnetic turbulence in snrs. however, whereas the ccd instability is driven by a current _ parallel _ to the initial magnetic field, the pdci is produced by an _ perpendicular _ to this field. this can lead to a mean flow velocity parallel to ( and perpendicular to ) the field, providing a potential source of strong magnetic field amplification. we use two - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to model the growth and the efficiency of the acceleration of particles, and field at the shock. we find that, if the cr differential current is kept constant and the instability is observed to be a decreasing function of the overall cr current, producing a ccd - like field amplitude, the upstream of the shock would be too weak to amplify the magnetic fluctuations of the order of the amplitudes inferred from x - ray observations. on the other hand, if a rapid back - reaction on the cr trajectories is neglected, the right - handed current can significantly deplete the pre - amplified field and increase its strength. we propose that this may be the mechanism to account for the additional amplification factor, which is needed to explain the strong amplified magnetic field inferred from snr x - rays. methods : numerical shock acceleration cosmic rays, magnetic fields
* purpose : * to identify the constant and time - varying viral dynamic parameters in an hiv dynamic model for patients under long - term treatment. * methods : * a nonparametric smoothing procedure such as the local polynomial smoothing is employed to obtain the measurement variables and their derivatives which are substituted into the regression models to estimate the unknown dynamic parameters. another approach is to use a spline - enhanced nonlinear least squares ( snls ) method. this approach avoids the problem of solving the nonlinear equations by numerical methods and is computationally efficient. * results : * the estimated virions of uninfected cells and the death rates of infected cells are found to be 2 to 4 fold and 5 to 8 fold, respectively, for patients i and ii, where the infection rate was stable after one or two weeks. the proposed multistage smoothing - based ( mssb ) approach, a hybrid optimization technique combining a gradient method and the state variables needed for a high - dimensional nls optimization problem, is very accurate and reliable. however, the cost of the software implementation is at least one order of magnitude higher than the solution time, hence the method is not suitable for practical applications. * conclusion : * since an estimated number of aids patients in the world is estimated to be @xmath0 approximately on average, there is a gap between the estimation of all the dynamic parameters and the actual treatment dose. we propose to fill this gap by introducing a procedure called the prior identifiability analysis which requires the information of all variables ( the unknown parameters ) from the first to the last step ( the regression model ) and then uses the first degree of nonlinearity to estimate all the parameters. this procedure is straightforward and does not require numerically solving the odes and the initial values of the variables are not very accurate. the practical applications of the proposed approaches are investigated by comparing the estimates of the constant dynamic parameters with the estimated ones in the existing global optimization methods. * conclusions : * based on the first step, the two approaches can be effectively combined for a global optimization problem. this will provide a better understanding of the complexity of hiv models, and will enable the design of more efficient and robust optimization methods in the future.
the super - long duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) probe ( _ svom _ ) is a proposed space - borne follow - up mission designed to fill in the gap between ground and space - based facilities in the early afterglow phase. it will provide complex multi - wavelength coverage, from x - ray to optical, and will provide real time localizations of grb - candidates down to sub - arcsecond precision in the energy range of about @xmath00.5 kev. the mission will use four instruments : eclairs, a coded mask telescope working in the 4250 kev energy range ( cxg ), a real - time data - processing electronic system ( uts ), and two narrow - field robotic telescopes, xiao and vt, operating in china and france, respectively. the equipments provided by the four instruments and the upts will allow to autonomously perform a slew operation towards the grb direction in order to provide rapid and accurate localization of detected sources. the vt telescope will also provide deep and uniform light - curves of the detected optical afterglows, and allow to do primary selection of optically dark grbs and high - redshift grb candidates. xiao will be able to localize approximately 75 % of grbs with a field of view better than 20 arcmin, and is designed to detect long grbs within a half - angle of 20@xmath1, sufficient to reach the degree of positional accuracy reached by xiao. the multiple imaging spectrometers on board will provide complementary to the vhf alert system, and the network will facilitate the dissemination of thegrb positions to the scientific community through the internet ( gcns, vo events, svom web page ). address = mission operation center, china institute of technology, beijing 100081 china address = max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik, giessenbachstrasse 1, 85748 garching, germany address = laboratoire dastrophysique de paris, piazza della repubblica 3, 16500 saint - martin dhres, f-91405 orsay cedex, france address = department of physics and astronomy, university of p.o. box 116, brookhaven national laboratory, upton, ny 11973, usa address = departamento de fsica, universidad nacional autnoma de
we present the first near - infrared multi - object spectroscopy of 42 galaxies drawn from the powir survey. we measure h@xmath1 luminosities from the spectra and calculate star formation rates ( sfrs ). different sfr colour calibrations are used to separate star forming and passive galaxies. we find that the star forming galaxies have a _ red _ sfr which drops with increasing mass, consistent with the drop in star formation occurring in less than a gyr across this redshift range. the passive galaxies have an _ anti - correlation _ between sfr and colour, such that the most massive galaxies turn off their star formation earlier than lower mass galaxies. this behaviour appears to be generic to all galaxies, implying that the process of turning off star formation in massive galaxies must have been relatively quick. we furthermore investigate whether there is any dependence on galaxy mass, the mass accretion rate and the redshift of our sample. there is no evidence, to our knowledge, for a dependence on either mass or stellar mass, but there is a possible dependence on all galaxy mass. by correcting the uv flux from dust attenuation with an extinction - corrected sfr, we show that the massive galaxies display a reduced sfr. this effect is particularly noticeable when using a mass cut to estimate the dust extinction. finally, we investigate the dependence of the sfr redshift on stellar mass. massive galaxies with stellar masses @xmath2 have lower sfr than the less massive galaxies, suggesting that these galaxies may have experienced a period of star formation quenching.

we present a study of the populations of continuum clumps of emission in the perseus molecular cloud, based on harp spectral - line maps ( @xmath0 ) of the central 4 regions in the four cores ( ngc 1333, ic348/hh211, l1448 and l1455 ). we use two different algorithms, clumpfind and gaussclump, to highlight their differences and biases. we partition the data using a friend - of - friends algorithm, which assigns a single pixel to each clump and computes the pixel - to - pixel size at a fixed spatial position. a comparison of clump identifications shows that, as with most previous studies, clumps are more likely to be associated with embedded objects than with an embedded clump population. we therefore try to find the clumps in the continuum by clumping them with both algorithms. in so doing, we also investigate the parameter space of each algorithm and determine which is optimal for rejecting spurious sources. we find that in both our two algorithms, the pixels used to assign a clump a new clump are typically too small to find significant clump signatures, implying that the pixels are mis - assigned. alternatively, using a least - squares fitting procedure, we can break - down the data into a number of gaussian - shaped clumps. the best - seeding parameters for the two algorithms are the position of the pixels and the lowest contour level at which pixels are assigned to the clump. we compare the number density of clumps found by each algorithm to the average values found by the other algorithms. our results show that, while both are accurate in the cases we have examined, the two methods are clearly different when compared in detail. in particular attention is paid to the population of prestellar cores, which are believed to be the direct precursors of single or multiple stars. the mass distribution of our clump - selected starless cores is remarkably similar to that of the global star formation mass function, showing that the stellar mass function is established at the earliest stages of cloud evolution.

the gravitational - wave signal from binary black hole coalescences carries information about the masses and spins of the two black holes, as well as the orbital elements of the binary and the distance to the binary. we calculate signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) for the three different phases of coalescence of binary black holes ( inspiral, merger and ringdown ), using three different signal - detection methods : ( a ) matched filtering searches, ( b ) searching for a complete set of merger templates for the inspiral phase of the coalescence, and ( c ) searches for their well - understood ringdown waves using the ligo / virgo network of ground - based interferometers. we find that the median redshift of the sources that are searched for in each case is @xmath0 for the initial ligo interferometer ; for the ringdown wave search the distance is reduced by a factor of @xcite. for the lisa square - root of the black hole mass parameter, the source counts down to a pair of source parameters : the effective transverse distance and the anisotropy of the source spectrum. the vacuum einstein equation of motion predicts the radial distribution of inspiral waves should contain a roughly log - normal distribution, with a median of about two sources for each redshift interval. the merger waves, which carry information on the mass and spin of the final black hole, should be detectable by lisa, for the range of black hole masses and radii in which they are most sensitive. we estimate the threshold for the detection of merger waves at the level in each of the three methods. we suggest that lisa can detect at least several sources per year at the high - redshift end of the ` ` nlthreshold '' for black hole mergers, which are thought to be forming in globular clusters or in galactic nuclei. if found, lisa will be able to distinguish between mergers of neutron star binaries, in which the individual black holes are driven together by dynamical friction and gas accretion, and giant black hole accretion onto a single supermassive black hole.
we show that a 1:1 resonance between a pair of extrasolar planets can be induced in a radial velocity data set by the planet - planet interaction. the configuration of three spherical bodies orbiting an equilateral triangle is studied within the framework of the general horseshoe - type problem and the restricted 3-body problem. the bodies are placed on circular orbits about the centre of mass, with angular velocities in the range @xmath0. the resonant interaction between the planets is mediated by the azimuthal modulation of the high frequency sinusoid around the fundamental orbital frequency of the system. such resonant interactions have been observed in a number of current and past resonant systems, and are likely to be widespread as a result of the ongoing radial velocity surveys. indeed, we note that such systems are currently sitting unrecognized within the accumulated data of the internal velocity surveys, and that the line - of - sight radial velocity variation of the central star shows a distinctive pattern. furthermore, we show that the envelope modulation, with its characteristic accordion - like shape, has a self - consistent dynamical significance despite the absence of an integral constraining the motion. we describe the dynamical behavior of configurations in which both planets are of the order of jupiter, and we point out that such configurations may be common. in the general case, we find that when the 2:1 resonant pair is found, the configuration is unstable to small perturbations and only acts as a low - frequency disturber of the other planets. this is in contrast to the case of a single 1:2 resonance, in which by far the most of the perturbation is due to the smaller planet. in all configurations, the lower eccentricity planet at the resonance moment has already passed periastron. however, the resonance is robust, and self - consistently determined, by a careful analysis of the tangential components of the solution set. we conclude with a discussion of the formation of co - orbital planets.
we investigate the exchange of energy and excitation between two parallel coupled nonlinear oscillator chains, which can be considered as a classical counterpart of two weakly coupled bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in a josephson junction with tunneling inter - atomic interaction. we find, both analytically and numerically, two qualitatively different regimes of energy exchange between the phase - coherent breathers ( intrinsically localized short - wave nonlinear excitations ) in two small weakly linked nonlinear chains. in the low - amplitude mode, the breather does not interact with the other coupled chains except through periodic transverse translations ( wandering ) between the chains. these two breather modes are detached by a separatrix, at which the rate of the inter - chain energy exchange vanishes. we show that this two regimes have a profound analogy, as the relative phase oscillation of the one - chain breather, measured by interference between the two coupled chains, is also analogous to the evolution of the relative quantum mechanical phase, observed by means of inter - bosonic interference in a single bosonic tunnel junction, for which the translational energy and the excitation rate, for the both chains, can be related by a similar pair of equations. in both regimes, the coupling between two breathers is anti - correlated with the intra - chain nonlinearity. we also simulate the behavior of discrete breathers in the two - chain system and in the large - amplitude ( @xmath0 ) mode, and in both cases the direction of the wandering period and the position of the wanders period is found to depend on the number of chains. the two regimes are characterized by very similar features, which provide strong indications of the commonalities between them. on the basis of these new results, we predict a new tunneling regime, described by a similarly dephasing - induced single - junction quantum tunneling, in two dimensions, in which the relative phases of both breathers oscillate around the energy - exchange constants, modulo the anharmonic constant, whose macroscopic quantum dynamics can be also characterized by a simple pair of coupled mean - field equations. _ _ pacs : _ 42.50.lc - 05.45 + k -12.20.-d -11.10.-z _ + _ keywords : _ nonlinear dynamics - weakly - localized breathers - excitation exchange - tunneling quantum dynamics
this homology paper is concerned with homology theories for associative shelves. in particular, we compare the results on bar - laub and hochschild homology and one term homology from the point of view of lbo homology with relations to idempotent semi - groups and an associative shelf. this homology theory is extended to a much weaker model for very weak simplicial modules. a novel addition to the previous work on this subject is the possibility to define a chain complex extending the work on the one side of the self - distributive algebraic structure on the other. the main result of this paper is that for a unital shelf @xmath0 satisfying the associativity axiom, the problem of chain complex homology can be solved. the derivation of the chain complex is motivated by the fact that a well - known construction in @xcite uses the axioms of a pre - simplicial module and a disk algebra. it would be useful to extend that construction to a more general setting but it is not possible. before going on to homology, however, it is useful to understand the connections between the various models mentioned above and the homologyacy of the various algebraic structures. this is the purpose of this note to give a sense of the connections and structure of the different models of homology using.this is the first part of a two part article. in the other part of the paper, the main results are as follows. [ intro. ] the main goal of this article is to describe the possible homology models for a special class of non - commutative, very weakly interacting, i.e.non - abelian, models. the model which is introduced in this article, is the model based on the isomorphism between a disk and a laub semi - group. the other properties of the model are the following four properties. 1. all three of the above propositions are proved. the first and the second axiom are always valid for unital shelves. the third axiom is the one involving an arbitrary non - trivial chain complex.

we present new hst / acs images of the sombrero galaxy ( m104 ) that have been reprocessed to obtain accurate measurements of its globular cluster ( gc ) population and to define the ` ` fundamental plane '' of gc structural parameters. we use 652 clusters in a field of @xmath0 centered on m104 to derive their effective ( half - light ) radii, effective size, and structural parameters, a total of 652. the individual cluster profiles have been fitted with king and wilson dynamical models that account for the following : ( 1 ) there is a single clearly identifiable luminous ucd belonging to the galaxy ; ( 2 ) the ucd effective radius is significantly larger ( by at least an order of magnitude ) than the average effective radius of luminous clusters in milky way galaxies ; ( 3 ) the distribution of effective radii is centered at the well - known point - spread function ( psf ) with a peak - to - tail that extends to a galactocentric distance of 9.6 mpc ; ( 4 ) the sdf has a characteristic scale size ( @xcite ) that is remarkably similar to that of the extended gc population in giant ellipticals, and ( 5 ) the gcs in m104 have a common spatial extent of at least 40 kpc in projection, which is clearly larger than what is found for most gc populations in other galaxies. we find that the real gc size can be related to the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and the original scale size of the protocluster population, and both of these parameters are at odds with the current sfe estimates that suggest that the present - day sfe may depend on location on the image. we show that the origin of the current gc distribution can be produced by the evolution of a pre - enriched gc gas in the tidal field of the galaxy, and that the progenitor had a mass density that was established _ earlier _ in the past. we provide a physical model that reproduces the red sequence, the cut - on point where self - enrichment starts to dominate over rapid gas expulsion, and the broadening of the overall gc color distribution. in addition, we discuss the observed color - metallicity relations for both metal - rich and metal - poor gcs, and show that they match the observed red sequence and the blue sequence better than the king model but not the wilson model. the latter model fails to reproduce the red and blue
we present deep _ hubble space telescope _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) observations of the perseus cluster, extending our previous study of this cluster out to its outer regions. using these data, we identify a sample of eleven dwarf spheroidal ( de ) galaxies, located at projected distances @xmath0 kpc from the cluster centre, which show irregular morphologies with little or no signs of recent star formation. we compare the morphologies and number counts of these des to those of dwarf ellipticals ( des ) in the cluster core, and find that dwarfs in the outskirts are systematically more disturbed, which we take as evidence that these dwarfs are undergoing a morphological transition from late to early type galaxies. however, despite being morphologically disturbed, we do not find any evidence for the same colour magnitude relation ( a and s ) for dwarfs near the cluster centres. we find dirrs in the f555w and f814w colour - magnitude diagrams, which lie close to the cluster cores, but are either infalling into the cluster for the first time, or on a highly radial orbit. the structures of our des are consistent with previous suggestions of a late - infall scenario, and we find that the colours of dwarfs transform prior to entering the cluster. we identify ten new dirr candidates based on their morphologies, all of which show disturbed colours and faint morphologies. if these dirrs are stripped of their star formation, we would have an average dwarf galaxy population of 5 des, demonstrating that dwarf galaxies in dense environments do not originate from an infalling population. we conclude that the different environments that host dwarf galaxies can not be explained solely by the difference in star formation histories of dwarf galaxies between clusters. instead, a complex combination of environmental conditions seems to be required to explain the diversity of dwarf galaxy populations seen in different environments.

we discuss new family classifications for asteroids in mean motion resonances with jupiter, plus a revision and critical discussion of the classification for families in the hilda region. a v - shape in the plane with coordinates proper @xmath0 and proper elements of asteroids is used to estimate collisional ages, provided a yarkovsky factor is present in the proper elements. in the case of the trojan asteroids, the traditional family classification is replaced by the ( 153 ) hilda family, severely depleted in small size members and with a much larger number of members. also families with a strange shape ( apparently due to removal of the namesake asteroid ) are found, including the ( 624 ) hector family. instead there are five families with enough membership to be suitable for age estimation, but in significant way by secular resonances, in which either all or a good portion of the members are locked. for these families we either have not found a consistent collisional model, or we have found alternative collisional models but the results are not consistent. as a general rule, families which are locked in the mean motion resonance are considerably younger than those which are free of the resonance. this is not just a matter of observational selection, but also a consequence of the different dynamical properties of the families : their semimajor axis has a drift, while other elements can undergo a secular drift, thus giving rise to large, strongly eroded families. in several cases the family is significantly depleted in members, while in the remaining cases it has up to 508 members. these latter numbers are significantly larger than those found in previous investigations. before being able to interpret these results self - consistently, however, it is necessary to provide a theory of the long term dynamical evolution of these families, a theory which clearly needs to be calibrated with the new data presented in this paper. this work discusses the complex relationship between dynamical families and collisional families ( formed at a single time of collision ).
flywheel - assisted absolute frequency measurement of strontium lattice clocks is a crucial tool for real - time evaluation of clock performance. here we report on the first comprehensive experimentally - based study of the influence of the flywheel oscillator on the absolute frequency of a sr lattice clock. the experiment was carried out in october 2014 with a 1d - optical lattice at stark - shift cancellation wavelength of 813 nm and a continuous running maser flywheel. we show that the combination of a fast and stable flywheel provides a time - scale that is more stable than the maser s for periods of up to @xmath0 s and can be used for long - term stability, even when the up - time is very short. the result is a measurement accuracy of better than 1 % and a fractional uncertainty of the signal - to - noise ratio less than 1.1@xmath1. this is among the highest available for any optical clock and opens the way for realistic short - term evaluation of flywheel clocks. the internal stability of optical clocks is paramount in numerous scientific fields, including astronomy, atomic physics, nuclear physics, gravitational physics, and communications. in particular, the accuracy of external - atomic clocks is of particular importance for atomic clock applications, where a precise measurement of even the smallest periodic oscillators due to the birefringent nature of the cosmic microwave background is a mandatory requirement. among external atomic clocks, the best known systems are the optical clocks based on carbon - oxygen clocks, which can be understood by a dynamical picture of an atomic clock interacting with an external source, e.g., a free - running hydrogen maser. however, these clocks exhibit various degrees of instability due to decoherence and thermal fluctuations. among these, the most common contraints are the requirement of accuracy for absolute frequency measurements and the relative importance of reliability for frequency identification, precision, and flexibility. to achieve these stringent constraints, it is necessary to develop systems that perform far better than state - of - the - art, i.e., reliable, and fast. for this reason, optical clocks have received much attention over the last few years @xcite. a particular class of clocks is the optical clock of blackbody radiation ( bbr ) detectors, which are based on the interaction of a static electric field with a periodically time - varying source ( often referred to as a stark shift ) and an external magnetic field. because of the competition between external fields and the stark shift, bbr
we study the attracting tori of hyperbolic systems in the presence of randomness. as a first result, we show that the set of solutions that stay inside of such horseshoes for all times is a strange in the sense that it contains an embedded horseshoe. we also show, using the framework of newhouse theory, that only events of positive lebesgue measures are observable in the phase space. in the second part of the paper, we study the attractors of periodically kicked limit cycles. a main topic in the theory of dynamical systems is the emergence of attractors that are not merely attractors, but whose existence is predicted by a certain theory. such attractors have been studied by aurelie baehr - jones @xcite, and also by chan _ et al._@xcite. an important discovery in this area is the structure of the so - called serre ball, which is an example of an @xmath0-dimensional dynamical system. it is known that the riemann surfaces of such systems are homeomorphic to the space of symmetric self - adjoint operators, and thus belong to the universality class of euclidean invariants. in fact, it has been shown explicitly that the corresponding csa functions are given by the relativistic bekenstein equations, and that their solution set correspond to the isomorphism class of a local field with a positive measure. ( see section [ sec1 ] for the relevant definitions. ) we now consider the situation where the tangle of homoclinic tangles is a random system. let us consider tangles of transversal order over a space that is partially convex. we call these _ dissipationless _ solutions. if this area are sufficiently large, then there exists a solution that stays inside of the tangles, from both the positive and negative directions of time. we refer to this situation as _ the dissipation class_. the _ origin _ of these solutions is unclear. it may be that they represent sinks of very strong contraction. however, if they are not dissipative, they are of very low contraction. we may try to solve this problem by considering the simplest case of an embedding system : a system in which there is an arbitrarily large amount of material that is badly behaved with respect to classical chaos theory. this situation, although interesting, has not been solved so far. the purpose of this paper is to provide a general framework for studying such systems, with the aim of
we use x - ray images of 33 cooling flows in the cores of 33 central dominant galaxies ( cdgs ) to investigate the relationships between star formation and agn properties in cdgs and their host galaxies. our sample is drawn from the @xcite sample of cooling flows whose central galaxies show evidence of agn activity, as indicated by cavities in the icm. we find that, in many systems, the central supermassive black holes are growing at rates that scale roughly with each other in rough agreement with the magorrian relation. the implied black hole growth rates vary across the sample, which, in most of our sample, are insufficient to account for the large - scale properties of the galaxy. however, the median growth rates are well below the eddington limit ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ). the objects in our sample are not always hot, massive, and bulge - dominated, as may be expected in hierarchical cold dark matter cosmology ; in some cases, their gas temperatures are cooling to near room temperature. our results imply that agn outbursts are powerful enough to quench cooling and to produce sufficient energy to trace the present day growth of the black hole and its host galaxy. for objects that do not have supercavities and shocks extending beyond the cooling radius, we find they are still in a cooling phase, suggesting that their cavities represent more energy than required to balance cooling. using the estimated efficiencies of gas removal and heating rates from the intracluster medium ( icm ), we argue that our results suggest that delayed cooling in these systems may be a key ingredient in allowing the central black hole to grow and supplant the cdg as a power source. for those systems that have sufficient energy injection from the central agn, we show that they can maintain cooling to levels that are comparable to the star formation rates in their central galaxies. as a result, we speculate that these cooling flows may be quenched before they emit any more energy and may thus be responsible for the current star formation in the universe. = 1
we present an empirical analysis on the ratio @xmath0 between the elastic hadron - hadron scattering cross sections as a function of the c.m. diffractive fraction and the ratio between the total cross - section and the elastic slope, probing also the asymptotic properties of the hadronic interactions in the energy region 7 - 8 tev. the analysis is based on a comparative study of all the available experimental data, including all the data on air showers up to 5 gev, the recent atlas data at 7 tev and the integrated cross sections at 2.2 and 4.3 tev, as well as a detailed discussion on the selection of suitable empirical parameterizations. generalizing previous works, we introduce four analytical parameterizations, consisting of two sigmoid functions composed of two elementary functions of the energy and two power laws representing the energy. by extending the standard analysis of qcd to cosmic - ray energies, we investigate, as a free and as constrained cases of the standard black disk limit and alternatively between constrained and unconstrained scenarios, two variants of the blackshift limit and two fit procedures. altogether, 5 fit procedures are considered, with two parameterization variants considered. the dataset considered consists of 40 data reductions comprised of 1 ) the experimental data on single and double dissociation processes, ( 2 ) those obtained from elastic scattering at the highest energies reached by accelerator machines ; ( 3 ) those from the at the low momentum transfer region, ( 4 ) cosmic ray data on the diffractive processes associated with the inelastic channel and/or air showers ; and ( 5 ) all the results obtained from the literature. we show that our selected parameterization and fit result indicate a global description of the soft scattering states, namely a change in the dynamics of the strong interactions at the beginning of a saturation effect, once described by a single power law or a logarithmic law, which is related to the opacity function and the cross section - momentum transfer transformation. as a practical consequence, equivalent data descriptions may be obtained in different phenomenological contexts, associated with different physical pictures for the same phenomenon, and therefore characterized by some intrinsic limitations. cern - lhc - ph - th/2009 - 124, dcpt/09/112, ftpi - minn-09/24, cu - hep-09 - 141, cpu - ph/10/09, bp 9860
we report on the timing and spectral properties of the soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ), based on _ xmm newton _, _ swift_-xrt, and _ rosat _ archival data. we found that the quiescent phase of was highly variable during the outburst, and that the peak energy of the thermal component ( pn ) decreased by up to @xmath0 during the first day of the outburst. the non - thermal component, which may be a result of the twisted magnetosphere model, decays more slowly than the power - law one. by the end of the third day, the flux had dropped by more than a factor of two, and there was no sign of a bursting activity. this is the first time, so far, that a variable hard x - ray emission is detected for a magnetar during an outburst. we discuss the pulse profiles and the spectral changes in phase and time as a whole. we produced dynamic spectral profiles, which we define as profiles ( dsps ) for the entire outburst. using a phase - resolved spectroscopy analysis, we fitted the spectra of for all the observations. the absorbed bb plus pl model provides an excellent representation of the data, both when leaving free and when fixing it to the most accurate value derived in the phase - averaged fitting. by comparison with other sgrs, we argue that our results should be reevaluated. in particular, the 2009 january 22 outburst of the axp e seems to be an extreme case of persistent emission. we present a detailed phase - analysis of this new sgr, as well as of the characteristics of the prior outburst and the outburst itself. finally, we summarize the behaviour of this extremely soft sgr during its outburst.

we present the results of a programme of new mm / sub - mm / far - ir observations of the @xmath0 radio galaxy 8c1435@xmath16635. these observations, part of a larger programme to obtain further constraints on the cosmic evolution of this and similar high - redshift sources, follow the detection of a steep - spectrum radio galaxy 4c41.17 by dunlop et al. ( 1994 ) and provide new constraints on its radio and optical properties. our new mm observations ( the deepest to date ) are sensitive enough to detect the co emission lines in the mm continuum to a depth of 0.2arcsec and to depths of 2.7arcsec ( 4.5ksec ). the spectral - line luminosities and gas / dust masses measured in this wavelength range are comparable to those measured previously in millimeter - wave ( mm ) surveys of similar objects, and suggest that the dust and gas masses are co - similar in nature. we therefore claim that the co luminosity - to - gas mass ratio in this galaxy is at least consistent with that seen in other nearby massive ellipticals at similar redshifts. to reach a reliable lower limit for the molecular gas mass we adopt an upper limit on the dust / dust ratio of around 0.1. accepting the galactic calibration for the dust mass we find that the interstellar extinction must be less than 0.3 dex, and that the total dust / gas mass, within the galaxy, at the epoch of the observations, is less than what would be expected from an einstein - de sitter universe. this result is consistent with the conclusion of schlegel & jaffe ( 1996 ) that the cosmic dust must be much more massive than previously estimated, and argues against the suggestion that the galaxy might be in the process of forming a significant fraction of its eventual stellar population. if the progenitor galaxy is a very massive present - day elliptical with a gas mass of 8c 1435 + 635, as has been suggested, then this indicates that very young ellipticals may not yet be forming stars. this is supported by the fact that, after only 23.5myr of evolution, the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in this particular galaxy has already peaked at @xcite, and is apparently conserved most of its initial mass. it remains, however, a highly uncertain quantity which may or may not be related to the sfr of the present day milky way galaxy 2mass j2000.
we present the detailed surface photometry in the @xmath0 band for a sample of 99 early type galaxies, extracted from the second release of the _ hubble deep field _ ( hdf ) frames, in order to obtain accurate morphological classifications and reliable galaxy sizes. the hdf ellipticals were selected from the van den bergh et al. ( 1996 ) sample of elliptical galaxies by selecting _ early type _ objects from the wfpc2 hdf frames. the morphological type selection was performed using the _ aiap _ package, equipped with the completely interactive graphical interface. thirty - four objects of this sample turned out to be disk - dominated ( _ disk _ in two cases ), whereas 28 more objects showed peculiar or unclassifiable profiles. these galaxies were excluded from the final sample of _bona fide _ early types. from the analysis of the luminosity and geometrical profiles, 34 objects of the sample were identified as being _ disk dominated _ on the basis of the light concentration. moreover, 28 objects were found to be peculiologically different from the others in the sample ( e.g. not belonging to the flat class ). in this way we provide the most reliable estimate of the galaxy sizes at high redshift. after _ drizzling _, the pixel size in arcseconds of the three wf cameras of these 3-band frames turns out be even better than that of the pc ( @xfig.4 ). moreover the very long total exposure times of the final images allow us, for the first time, to study the surface brightness profiles of galaxies with surface luminosities extending outwards to very far from their optical centers, i.e. beyond the optical cores. it turns out that the shape of the profiles is almost invariant with respect to the redshift evolution of the galaxies, in agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the global approach to the star formation history. the ellipticity distribution of our sample shows a clear trend with the decreasing slope of the scaling relations towards different morphologies. + * key words : * galaxies : elliptical and lenticular, cd galaxies : evolution galaxies : formation galaxies : high - redshift
we report on a high resolution ( 20 fwhm ) _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observation of the luminous radio - quiet qso hs 1700 + 6416 ( @xmath0 = 2.72 ) with the fos. we detect absorption lines from several species including multiple ionization stages of si and al, so we use photoionization models to study the metal absorption in this qso. the data provide accurate measurements of the metal abundances to within the 2@xmath20 uncertainties. we derive a total column density of,, and for the lyman limit. the total abundances of si, al, and are comparable to those derived from studies by vogel & reimers ( 1995 ), but several of these lines show coincidental line pairs which may be false positives for the abundances derived from profile fitting. we also confirm an excess of weak absorbers at = 0.00855 with respect to a mean number of absorbers per unit redshift of 2.3. we suggest that this excess is due to line saturation in the low ionization systems. in most cases the absorption lines are strongly blended with several lines of different species at different redshifts. line profile fitting requires a broad component which may split up into several subcomponents at the high resolution of the data, and consequently absorption by low and high ionization species which appear to be at the same redshift at this redshift may not actually be associated. these problems should be greatly alleviated by higher resolution observations of the qso spectra using the space telescope imaging spectrograph. \(1 ) we detect a dense cluster of doublets, including one doublet at 2.84506, which is not significantly affected by unresolved or incomplete covering. \(2 ) from the profiles of the lines we find that there are at least 4 doublets in this complex, and we see indications of a high metallicity in the intervening absorbers. we briefly discuss the physical conditions and abundances in the absorption systems. \(3 ) we note that the sight line exhibits two extended x - ray sources within a few arcminutes of the high redshift sight line. we only detect one absorber associated with the extended sources, and it is likely that the rest of the ll absorbers occur in intervening clouds with additional absorption arising in a separate cloud which does not produce absorption. \(4 ) there are indications that several ll systems are already present in a nearby intervening medium, and some suggest that part of the
we establish a connection between strain softening ( or softening ) in jammed solids and rate - dependent softening at finite strain rate, using microscopic stress relaxation and flow start - up experiments. consistent with granular experiments, we find that an initially isotropic packing softens when it has undergone an extensive number of contact changes that is comparable to the number of contacts it initially had in excess of isostaticity. we characterize stress relaxation in linear elasticity by measuring the relaxation modulus over packings prepared at varying pressure. at large strain amplitudes, there is a narrow linear elastic window that bounds the softening process : packings sheared faster than a characteristic strain rate that is obtained by driving the system slowly enough to collapse to a quasistatic curve. near jamming, however, the system requires a time @xmath0 to relax fully after a perturbation. when the jammed packing is driven at a faster rate, it can not relax fully and hence its response depends on the driving rate. invoking the pressure scaling of the linear elastic modulus, we identify a crossover from strain hardening to softening. the behavior of this crossover and its associated scaling exponents are in qualitative agreement with recent numerical simulations of soft spheres. jamming is one of the most important phenomena in physics, often described as a transition from elastic to non - elasticity in the sense of dagois - bohy @xcite. the crossover is fundamental to the formation of a variety of soft materials : foams, emulsions, colloidaloids, granularites, and colloidal suspensions. these systems lose their elasticity when the imposed strain rate is slower than the longest relaxation time in the system, i.e. the system relaxes much more slowly than a fully relaxed jammed packing. this phenomenon is called ` ` softening '' ; softening is characterized by a complex complex shear modulus that increases with increasing strain amplitude and isospin density. nonlinear elasticity is commonly associated with deformations in elastic materials, and has been seen to often replace softening as the dominant process to jam. this crossover occurs across a number of length scales : contact changes first isolate the stress, then drive it to a finite value, and finally drag it out of the elastic regime.
we show that the presence of dust and the morphology of a galaxy are inextricably intertwined. the disk of a spiral galaxy can be classified as a _ gas - dominated _ population i disk ( ob associations, hii regions, cold interstellar hi gas ), or a _ star - heated _ population ii disk ( for a review, see e.g. block and wainscoat @xcite ). in the dust penetrated regime, the morphologies of spiral galaxies are determined by the pitch angle ( or tully - fisher index ) of the stellar arms. we therefore propose two _ archetypes _ of a given galaxy s disk : ` ` late type c '' and ` ` early type a ''. the former classifies the disk as late type a, while the latter classifies it as early type b. we show that a disk with a dominant m=1 mode at k@xmath0 ( i.e., with a pitch angle of @xmath1 5 ) is classed as a ` ` young'disk, binned according to its ellipticity and redshift. we suggest that ` ` old '' disks with a high effective albedo may not be appropriate for spirals, because the opacity due to dust grains at k is too low to reveal underlying spiral structure. we then present the results of numerical simulations to illustrate the robustness of the proposed archetype for binning according to pitch angle. for a coherent physical framework for the excitation of spiral structure in galaxies, we consider the co - existence of the above - threshold density waves and the distribution of old stellar disks. the pulsating density waves provide the necessary feedback to displace the dust grains in the plane of the galaxy. since the spiral arms are very tightly wound, a feedback of wavetrains is required to remove the dust from the galaxy, and if the epicyclic frequency of the density waves matches that of the old stellar disk, the evolution of the spiral structure is then also followed by a transition to a younger ` ` burst '' of star formation.

the strong forward and reverse shocks in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) heat both the ejecta and the shocked ambient medium to x - ray temperatures. the amount of energy these shocks put into ionized particles is uncertain, but a large fraction of their energy must be put into accelerated protons or transferred to cosmic rays. previous studies have shown that snrs can accelerate protons up to tev energies, supporting the case for efficient proton acceleration. however, these studies assumed that the shocks do not contribute a significant fraction to the cosmic ray emission. here, we develop a model that couples self - similar plasma dynamics to diffusive shock acceleration, allowing a more self - consistent treatment of the latter. we show that as the shock velocity increases from the contact discontinuity, the fraction of cosmic ray modified gas escaping from the shock decreases compared to that in the case of unmodified gas. as a result, the temperature and density of regions with non - equilibrium ionization are altered. compared to unmodified material, the modified model predicts cooler regions and more intense thermal x - rays ( due to the increased energetic injection of electrons and protons ). the change in the equation of state ( e.g., ionization timescale ) and the increase in the shocked temperature from effects are mild, but significant for a broad range of shock ejecta masses and ages. our modified hydrodynamics model is applicable to snrs with age @xmath0 years, while older snrs have a higher temperature and more violent ejecta ( as may be inferred from observations of sn1006 and rcw86 ). for the majority of cases, the changes in the shock density and temperature are small or slightly non - thermal. large changes ( to several orders of magnitude ) can occur for shock parameters as high as 10 times the age of the snr. these changes are not likely to be detected by the kepler space telescope, unless a substantial fraction of the shock material is swept away. = 1
the possibility of electron holes being the source of auroral kilometric radiation is discussed. holes are identified as candidates for transporting the trapped electromagnetic radiation down to the lower ionosphere or to the neutral atmosphere. their transport properties are utilised to transport the trapped radiation down through the auroral current region. numerical simulations suggest that such a radiation can be transported down to low auroral altitudes, through the ionospheric plasma and into the atmosphere, with a transport speed of the order of @xmath0 km s@xmath1. such a transport is likely to occur only when the electron cyclotron frequency is sufficiently low. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 ) # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 aurora collaboration, submitted to z. phys. c 2 ( # 3 ) # 4 m. a. prez - hernndez et al., ` ` circumstellar matter from the aurora, '' nature * 484 *, 667 - 669 ( 1998 ). e. knill, r. l. brommer, and d. j. fixman, _ auroral observations _ ( university of california, pasadena, ca 91109, 2001 ). d. k. ralph, t. s. souto ribeiro, s. pdua, j. e. m. lpez - hauck, d. maystre, h. p. jones, a. konopacky, m. orlov, p. zvezdin, g. v. korolkova, and s. popelka, * auroral acceleration and emission from relativistic electrons : theory, magnetic fields and auroral continuum radiation *, * rev. mod. phys. a * 81 *, 751 - 793 ( 2005 ). a. d. greentree, c. t. luukkonen, e. he, n. heintzelman, and m. b. konen, _ high energy physics and applications _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 2014 ), in proc.- s. l. wong, ed., _ bowen wolfgang goethe - universitt, new york, ny 10027, u.k. _ pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.qq, 98.80.bp, 98c
we report results of molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid ag - se system @xmath0se@xmath1 based on _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics, which we use to investigate the structure, the atomic dynamics and the electronic structure of this liquid at different temperatures and compositions. the main issues we address are : the variation of atomic structure with temperature and composition, and the way this structure is related to the experimental electrical conductivity. we also address the question of how the low - temperature, thermally - pulsed liquid behaves in the light of the ionic nature of the solid, in particular the presence of a pseudogap in the electronic density of states. our results show that the liquid undergoes major changes of atomic ordering at increasing temperature, so that it no longer behaves as a good metal, but becomes a stoichiometric alloy with a wide - gap semiconductor when the se content is increased from 0.1 to 1.3. the electrical conduction occurs through chains and se - se bonds in the liquid, not through a single ionic channel. we argue by comparison with density functional theory that this type of heterocoordination is generic in many liquid alloys, and that this pattern is a common feature of alloys with se present. we use our results to test the predictions of semi - analytical models based on density - functional theory, and we find them to be in agreement with the experimentally observed charge - balance and electron density - ratio distribution functions. at high temperatures, we find the electrons to be trapped within the alloys vertical structure, so - called pseudogaps, which are known to form in semiconductor systems and to close to their equilibrium structure. as the composition is further varied the electrons are drained from the electrons and the gap closes, resulting in less of the pseudogapped electrons remaining in the gap. this leads to a reduction in the mean conductivity, and a loss of ionic correlation between se and ionic degrees of freedom. the effect is more pronounced in the more se - rich liquid. we conclude that clearly different phases of ionization are needed for the system to remain in the pseudo - two - dimensional steady state.
we study the adversary s ability to distinguish a randomly chosen permutation from a random function. this is a combinatorial problem fundamental in cryptology. a standard solution to this problem is the following : an adversary submits a query to an oracle, and the oracle is expected to produce a function which gives the same answer no matter whether or not the query is a permutation. the adversary is given a budget of @xmath0 queries, and can use any algorithm that submits the same query as he does in order to distinguish between the two cases. we consider the following generalization of this problem : + _ what is the minimal number of queries ( and hence what is its optimal efficiency ) that the adversary needs to get a significant advantage over the random function, given that the latter is truncated? _ this well - known question is based on the simple ` ` collision test '' and the birthday problem, and was first raised by bell and impagliazzo @xcite. they showed an algorithm that gives a non - negligible advantage ( in fact, their algorithm is arguably the best in the sense that it gives a bound as small as possible. ). in contrast, we are interested in _ adversary s advantage _, i.e., how many queries the adversary has to make before the adversary can achieve his goal. here, we show that the classic ` ` birthday '' bound is not valid for problem 1. we prove that there is a lower bound ( for general random function detection ) of comparable magnitude, based on a result of stam ( *??? * problem 1 ). for this problem, the lower bound is bounded by a simple factor, and we provide an elementary upper bound similar to the one given by bell et al. to get ( a slightly better ) better bounds, we apply the slightly better bound we prove by combining ( via the union bound ) the chebyshev inequality and the markov inequality. we also show that this bound is sharp. + _ key words and phrases : adversary s Advantage, randomly chosen function, concavity, entanglement, bell s theorem, birthday, asymmetric cryptology, computational complexity
we report on the long - term variability of the black hole binary gx 3394. we use data from the all - sky monitors ( asm ) on board _ ginga _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _, as well as x@xmath0 and 320 kev observations from the proportional counter array ( pca ). we find that the current optical / ir data imply a distance of @xmath115 kpc. in particular, the two recent complete outbursts from mjd 4840049500 ( at a redshift of 0.44 ) and mjjd 51388 ( at redshifts of 1.21 and 1.28 ) are characterized by a difference in the spectral behaviour of about 16100 kev. in the first of these two observations, we found that the fluxes in the three energy bands ( 2040, 4070 and 70160 kev ) correlate well, but we did not detect any correlations in the other two bands. in our recent study, we have attributed such differences to the different structure of the accretion flow in the two sources. one possibility is that the source is in a hard state, with its bolometric luminosity increasing by at least an order of magnitude compared to the one in the soft state. the other is that there is a current mass deficit within the inner disc, i.e., there is not much accretion there. in this case, the observed correlation between the luminosity and the flux in the hard state can not be attributed solely to the cooling action of the neutron star surface. instead, it seems to be due to a variable relative rate of cooling of the comptonizing plasma. we have compared theoretical models of thermal comptonization with the observed data and find that thermal componization explanation is the best explanation not only for the soft - to - hard spectral transitions, but also for the significant hardening of the power law.

we conduct extensive molecular dynamics simulations for three - dimensional binary soft - sphere mixtures to study the spatio - temporal structures of dynamic heterogeneities and its relation to the structural relaxation time. using the multi - point and multi - time correlation functions, we numerically determine the length and time scales for various glass - forming models. in particular, we investigate the manner in which the specifics of the model influence the extracted time scales. the scaling relationships of the extracted length scale and time scale are analogous to the dynamical scaling of the pair correlation obtained for the glassy dynamics. depending on the temperature, the dynamic length scale increases and becomes much longer than the @xmath0-relaxation time of the two - point correlation function for a typical supercooled liquid. furthermore, the temperature dependence of the time scale exhibits super - arrhenius behavior in the kalj, wahn, and ss models. on the other hand, the increase and decrease of the dynamic time scale with decreasing temperature is similar to the subtle but profound change that occurs with the change from heterogeneous to homogeneous dynamics in various condensed phase systems. our extensive numerical results reveal that the long - lived correlated domains correspond to the locally preferred structures ( lpss ), that are characterized by the voronoi polyhedra. the lps domains have spatial extent that becomes significant upon supercooling, in contrast to the wahn model that develops icosahedral order. in our simulations, the lifetimes of the dominant domain are found to increase with time and finally depend on the model and fragility. the model that produces the longest dynamic domains is a weakly interacting binary mixture of glassy and hard - sphere particles. the observed decoupling between the two time scales is in agreement with the previously mentioned experimental results.
loqc is a quantum teleportation experiment in which two qubits are sent through an optical network of single - mode beam splitters and a network of photon detectors. the goal is to transfer the photon state of one mode to some other mode without connecting the two through a single beam splitter. we describe the original scheme for loqc, in which each qubit is represented by a single photon in a superposition of two optical modes. the first element of the scheme is a controlled sign flip that will shift the phase of a mode containing two photons so that one qubit enters the other in the same mode. we characterize the improved protocol, which allows the teleportation of a fock state if one of the three modes is correctly registered. we use a mathematical simulation to determine the rate at which detector related errors increase with @xmath0, the number of photons that arrive at the detectors, and the rate of detector false positive results. the simulations show that the increased detector efficiency increases the success probability of the controlled sign teleportation. we also compare the success rate with that obtained when the detectors produce noise, and find that it is possible to reach 90 % success with a detector inefficiency of 1 %. quantum information processing using photons has made tremendous progress in the last ten years. a first step toward realizing quantum computers was proposed in the early 1990 s, with the goal of using photons to encode information in a format that does not require any nonlinear medium to allow the interactions between qubits @xcite. this idea was later refined by bennett and blum _ et al.__@xcite, who proposed a scheme where the information to be stored in a two - qubit system could be sent directly through a solid state quantum computer. the so - called linear quantum computing ( lqc ) was eventually developed for this purpose, and has since been a viable candidate for quantum computers. the basic idea is to use photons to interact with each other in a controlled manner, such that the final state of the system is well - defined and well isolated from any surrounding medium. because of the general theoretical interest in experimentally realizing this very large system of quantum computers, a large number of studies have been devoted to the study of detector errors and their effects on the quantum teleportation protocol. because the optical mode of the detector may be highly nonlinear in nature and because it may be used for information processing, it is important to understand the errors that occur in the operation of the device. in this paper we describe a general method for
we systematically study the transport properties of graphene with local magnetic moments in the kondo regime by means of the non - perturbative numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method. to solve the anderson impurity model for graphene with magnetic moments, we use the accurate scheme of anderson scattering approximation. we find that the equilibrium state of the system is a mixed valence system, whose electron density of states at the fermi level is finite, leading to characteristic features in resistivity and dephasing rate curves. for the case of magnetic adatoms, the electronic interaction between the impurity and the conduction electrons on the next nearest neighbors becomes asymmetric, giving rise to a larger effective electronic re@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ). the effect of this hybridization is larger in the presence of the on - site coulomb interaction, as was observed in recent experiments. as a result, the resistivity appears to be distinctly different from that in the conventional kondo effect in graphene, namely, with a pronounced peak in the zero - temperature resistivity ( fig. [ resistivity](a ) ), it increases steeply and eventually saturates to the near - zero temperature ( sc ) limit near the center of the crossover region. the normalized kondo resistivity is found to be an universal function of the chemical potential, which could fit well to that obtained from earlier nrg calculations. we suggest that this could be a manifestation of the recently reported anomalous kondo resonance in graphene with point defects and vacancies. finally, we also investigate the influence of the gate voltage and applied gate voltage on the kino transport properties. our results not only explain the anomalously high kondo temperature behavior observed recently in several experiments but also suggest directions for further transport experiments to identify the exotic features of the arising in graphene. + * keywords * : graphene, many - body correlation, graphene, magnetic fields, transport + * ams classification * : d12, d13, d16, d17, d18, d20, f75 + * corresponding author, e - mail : i.m.karabash@gmail.com, kashif_ammar@yahoo.com + j.k.ashby@bnl.gov 1.0 cm
we study the present - day star formation rates, stellar masses, and bulge - disk relations, in a sample of nearby disk galaxies. our sample consists of 257 disk galaxies with observations obtained using the spitzer space telescope, the galaxy evolution explorer, and the hubble space telescope. using color - color diagrams, we distinguish four types of bulges that are either actively forming stars at similar rates to their associated outer disks, or they are inactive. we study inactive pseudobulges by comparing their @xmath0 to that of the bulge and the stellar light. the difference in bulge morphology is due to whether or not young stars are located in the same region of the ism parameter space as those in intermedate - type galaxies. classical bulges have properties similar to elliptical galaxies ; in both intermediate- and late - type objects, the inactive bulges are systematically more massive per unit disk mass. however, in bulges with active star formation, the mass - to - light ratio is greater in the central few hundred parsecs than in the outer parts of the galaxies. such differences suggest that the nature of bulge growth in nearby disks is dichotomous. we find correlations between star formation rate density and both mass and mass density in pseudobulate bulges ; those with high sfr densities live inside the outer disks more rapidly than those with low sfr density. positive correlations between mass and sfr - density are construsted ; those negative correlations with mass and density are those that result from long - term internal bulge formation. the mean specific sfr of the nearby bulges in our sample is 0.01 m@xmath1 0.1 %. we estimate that the present day sfr in nearby active bulges is sufficient to build up the bulges we see today, and it is likely that over the next few gyr more than half of the stellar mass in the center of our sample will have been built up. therefore, bulges will continue to form at their present rates for at least another gyr. these results are consistent with the expectations of a hierarchical formation scenario, in which the inner regions of a galaxy building its outer disk at a steady, inward - moving mass concentration.
this paper introduces a novel numerical method to compute the action of a linear operator which is frequently encountered in applications in analysis and scientific computing. the operator is composed of a superposition of two fourier integral operators with different phase and amplitude distributions. the aim of this paper is to find a way to decompose the operator into a sum of components for which the oscillations are well - understood and low - rank representations are available. in addition, the number of such components is reasonably small which paves the way to design more efficient numerical algorithms. the method exploits the fact that fios are fios as proxies for the solution operator to a large class of hyperbolic differential equations. the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is lower than that required for standard summation by a radon transform, but up to a factor of @xmath0 for constant speeds. numerical simulations of free wave propagation with constant sound speed are straightforward. this algorithm can be used for applications in reflection seismology, radar imaging, ultrasound imaging, electron microscopy, and plasma medical imaging. pacs codes : 75.10.gh, 75.40.+s, 05.45.+q, 02.70.+k, 74.25.nq low rank separated approximation ; complex exponential ; free - space wave equation ; hough transform * program summary * _ manuscript title : _ fast linear operator for high - precision analysis and numerical computation + _ authors : _ beat rthlisberger, jrg lehmann, dmitry vjushin, gianluca geloni, johannes keldysh, jadran vlasov, jon brinkmann, and marnix van der lheck + _ program language : _ french ` ` fortran '' + _ number of processors used : _ 1 + _ supplementary material : _ + _ keywords : _ fios, harmonic oscillators, hough transforms, fast summation, differential operators + _ classification : _ 4.12, 4.14, 6.5 + _ external routines / libraries : _ numpy @xcite ( version 5.6 ) + _ nature of problem : _ numerical simulation of free waves. + _ solution method : _ a numerical method based on a fourier series expansion of the symbol in the angular variable arg, and a polyhomogeneous expansion in the perpendicular to coordinate representation of arg. the formula is simple to understand, and, in the case of complicated oscillations, easy to approximate. +
the recent growth of a new class of ultra - pure single crystals of oxygenated deoxygenated yttrium - stabilized zirconia @xmath0 has resulted in a new generation of cuprate superconductors with oxygen zero - point defects completely eliminated from the surface. we present a number of new results obtained on these new crystals in the microwave bandpass which provide a better understanding of the physical properties of the superconducting ground state. the new crystals are characterized by a new oxygen annealing procedure which avoids the critical problem of oxygen - vapor concentration and oxygen stoichiometry, and as a consequence, the ` ` fishtail '' anomaly in magnetization is suppressed. we also present a detailed phenomenological two - component model based on lattice fermions which reproduces the essential physical features of the crystals, including the spatial distribution of the conductivity peaks and their dependence on the oxygen stm. we show that the microwave conductivity data on the new set of crystals are consistent with mean - field behavior and do not require any theory of pairing to explain the mechanism of these features. in particular we confirm the presence of _ multiple _ pairing components ( which are on average stronger than a single ordered component ) and show that each of these components can provide a quantitative description of the microwave data. this suggests that microscopic models based on multi - component theories of superconductivity also can account for the data. _ _ the experimental results for the @x0 crystals can be explained in terms of two interacting fermionic systems _ i.e. _ two disordered systems which have ordered symmetries and are associated with different types of order parameter symmetry breaking interactions. it is _ not _ surprising that these two types of symmetry breaking mechanisms have not been considered in the past. in contrast to the previous discussion of the existence of two components ( one ordered and one non - ordered ) in this system we present clear evidence for _ two _ interconnected systems here. the two components can be viewed as resulting from the combined effect of these two ordering mechanisms : ( i ) rearrangement of oxygen vacancies in the conduction band and ( ii ) the occurrence of a mott insulator / superconductor transition inside the gap. the location of these metastable systems is sensitive to very small changes in the local oxygen and/or impurity concentrations, and may also be sensitive to local lattice oxygen stabilities. _
we present a detailed discussion of two physical processes for the formation of a @xmath0-pocket at the envelope - core interface of low - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars. one is the rotationally induced mixing with material from the h - rich intershell region which forms a shadow - like region above the receding convective envelope. the other is the overshoot of protons which terminates the initial proton - capture phase at the bottom of the envelope. although the physical principles of overshoot and the rotational case are quite similar we find that the neutron - capture efficiency as originally proposed for agb stars by herwig et al. ( 1998 ) is lower in this scenario because protons are lost more easily than neutrons. we discussed in detail the possible effects of a partial mixing zone caused by rotationally induce mixing as a function of metallicity and rotational velocity without overshoot. we found that for a range of the assumed parameters, overshoot leads to a proton - to - neutron spread which is 10 - 20 times larger than that required for the undershoot scenario. this spread can be reproduced by models in which overshoot is applied to all convective boundaries. however, such a spread is of the same order of magnitude or even larger in current models. we also discussed the possible impact of such a pocket on the third dredge - up of intermediate mass stars and concluded that it may introduce a statistical signature, which is certainly not appropriate for main - sequence stars, due to a spread of initial rotational velocities. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3 # = ` ` 0023 $ ='' 0024 % # 1eq.

we present a global analysis of the rates and the spectrum of the sno neutrino oscillations in the general case of @xmath0-molecular transitions into purely active neutrinos. this analysis includes the recent sno cc and nc rates and also the net sno nc rate, from which we extract an upper limit on the mass and mixing of the oscillation solutions. the best fit to the sk spectrum data is in the high(lma ) region, while no allowed region is obtained for the low solution at the 99 % cl level. a simple model independent analysis yields a 5.3@xmath1 pseudoscalar behaviour in the lma region, which rules out maximal mixing and a pure sterile solution in the low / qvo region. the results are compared to the sensitivity of the standard model ( ssm ) flux model in the same parameter range. in the cotvo region we find that multi band sk+snocc data together with single band sk data from the sk experiment at sno cover the whole range of allowed regions in the parameter space down to at least 2.2 mev. cern - ph - ep/2002 - 065 + tum - hep-2002 - 166 + dpnu-02 - 400 + hep - ph/0210407 * global analysis and fits of sno rates and sk spectrum * * nat. phys. * b * ( 19#2 ) # 3. * e * ( 16#3 ) # 1#2#3phys. rev. d * # 1 *, # 2 ( 1.3 ) [ e^-sno - r^cc_sno ) & f_b p_ee, [ three ] + r^nc _ sno _ i_e + p_ea, [ four ] epsf.sty [ cols= " < ", ] + z. bernet, f. gourbilleau, d. mayou, n. p. bigongioui, l. zhang, w. huang, a. h. mahmood, e. k. sun, s. stobbe, b. s. whittaker, r. w. thomsen and m. donev, _ cern, ch-1211 geneva 23, switzerland _ + * acknowledgements : * the first author is partially supported by the most part of the agence nationale pour la recherche (
we study the effects of frictional angular momentum loss ( faml ) caused by secular outbursts of novae on the secular evolution of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ). faml occurs when a roche lobe filling low mass secondary fills a hole in the envelope of a white dwarf ( wd ) which transfers mass to a secondary in the form of an isotropic wind. the mass transfer rate is driven by the angular momentum losses accumulated during this process. we specified a quantitative model for faml based on bondi hoyle accretion, in which the strength of faml depends crucially on the envelope expansion velocity @xmath0 at the secondary s location and on the mass of the wd. using this description we derive a formalism to replace the discontinuous sequence of nova cycles ( which in previous work has been taken from a nova model by prialnik & kovetz @xcite ) by a sequence of continuous wind accretion episodes and a smooth continuous wind average. for a given cv, this average evolution is characterized by sudden changes of the orbital parameters which change essentially discontinuously with the nova outburst time and by an amount proportional to the ejected envelope mass. these are in turn driven by a continuous variation of the _ total _ ( as measured by the ratio of the total ejected mass to the specific orbital angular momentum ). as a result of these discontinuities, the secular mean transfer rate and the orbital period are not continuous functions of time but _ change _ approximately discontinuously, with the former being smaller than the latter. hence although the evolution is not continuous, the toad characteristic, i.e. the absence of a period gap, can be taken as a consequence of having discontinuous mass transfer, even for situations close to mass transfer instability. we show analytically that the well known _ mass transfer stability _ criterion for the latter case can also be derived from a proper analysis of the real, discontinuous process. thus numerical calculations of the long term evolution of cvs show that faml only amplifies the transfer rate caused by systemic losses, it does not _ add _ to them. we argue that the latter is a particular cause of the observed gap in cvs. stars : novae stars : binaries : close novae : general stars : mass transfer stars : white dwarfs stars : oscillations stars : individual : faml
the taurus - auriga - perseus region has been observed by the _ rosat _ pspc on many young stars. the x - ray emission of the most active stars in this region is thought to arise in an optically thin, hot plasma at temperatures above @xmath0. recent studies based on the rotation of late - type stars suggest that the rotational evolution of such young stars determines the development of stellar activity. using the raw data from the archive we have studied the occurrence of flares on the t tauri stars ( ttss ), pleiads, and hyads. we find that the flare rate increases when switching from spectral types g to k. moreover, the flare luminosity depends on the level of measured quiescent emission in the field of view. using a statistical approach we have compared the actions of the flaring stars with respect to those of a classical ttts ( cttss ). we have also considered the effects of stellar multiplicity and rotation rate. the flare detection is performed with a bayesian algorithm which is implemented to simulate real events. a large number of flares have been reported, but most of them show a decay of the lightcurve within a few hours. a few flares have occurred in the ctts phase that could be explained by rotation rate fluctuations, but a significant majority of the flares are _ not _ related to rotational rate fluctuations. we found that the incidence of flares is independent of stellar age. however, correlations between flare activity and other stellar parameters ( such as the mass, the rotation rate, and the multiplicity ) were found to be in good agreement with the correlations found between the energy output of a flare and its spectral type. in this paper we discuss an alternative method for measuring the flare energy output, by comparing the energy outputs of various groups of stars that have different ages and multiplicity. we conclude that for a stellar population of the same age, there are three groups that show the highest degree of flare activity. the three groups can be described by a two - temperature model for the plasma, which is either a pure power - law or has an exponential decay.
diffusion - weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( dw - mri ) involves the measurement of local diffusivity of water molecules within tissues. for instance in the brain, diffusion is less constrained parallel to nerve fibers than perpendicular to them. recent research has been done on constructing diffusion / regularization processes on the 2-sphere defined at each spatial locus. in order to generalize our previous work on line / contour - enhancement via left - invariant diffusions on invertible orientation scores of @xmath0-images we first investigate the coupled space of positions and orientations in the hardi domain. we explicitly assume the underlying group structure on the domain of hardi images which can be inferred from the decomposition of the mapped states. we show that the group of 3d - rigid motions is included in the _ domain _, so a hardi dataset is considered as a function of a rigid body movement. consequently, we explicitly neglect the spatial - neighborhood information in hardi, which could lead to spurious hypo - elliptic diffusion kernels in the pseudo - linear scale spaces evolutions. as a result, we are able to enhance the original hardi / dti data using simultaneously orientational and spatial neighborhood information, which potentially leads to improved detection algorithms. the potential impact is evident : by hypo to birational hardi one can generate distributions from dti that are similar to hardi - modeling as recently reported by pr@xmath1kovska et al. [ phys. rev. lett. * 105 *, 120401 ( 2014 ) ]. furthermore, by using analytical morphological green s functions one can analytically approximate the kernel of the transversal erosion and dilation processes for both the direction and the brownian motion on the sub - riemannian manifold. in this way, it allows extraction of clinical information from these scans. as an application we provide a probabilistic interpretation of how the road map of where the fibers appear in the mri mri images can be maintained and we have developed a framework that can be applied to other mri / hardi systems.
the control of invisibility in scattering and absorbing media is governed by the pendry s equations for mass, heat and light, through a non - linear transform that remains invariant in certain cylindrical geometries. we apply this theory to the diffusive photon density wave ( dpdw ) equation, which is an extension of fick s equation for diffusive light scattering to the time domain without resorting to coordinate changes. we show that when the anisotropy of the diffusivity is anisotropic, that is, diffusive throughout the visible spectrum, the transformation is to be transformed to a diffusive three - dimensional equation for a single diffusive wave. the transformed diffusive particle density wave is a counterpart of the time - dependent schr " odinger equation in the context of quantum mechanics, which has been extensively studied in the cloaking and anamorphism literature. as an application, we consider the variation of the radiance coefficient and the speed of light in the invisibility region of a star - shaped diffusive cloaking medium, where we observe that an object placed in a transformed medium will scatter like a different object with deformed boundary, and will therefore be able to hide some impedance mismatch between the boundaries of the cloaks. this is based on a generalization of the idea of ` ` mimetism ', which was originally introduced by dermer and zolla - geuzaine for the diffusion of mass through a pull - back transformation of an arbitrary domain. we illustrate our theory using three examples : ( [ fig1 ] ), ( [ transfpressure ] ) and ( [ mimetistation ] ). the former is an analog of the laplace - zehnder equation for heat waves, while the latter is the counterpart of maxwell s equations, thus resulting in a new expression for the absorption coefficient, @xmath0, in opposite directions from the current time. we further apply our theory of non - linearly transforming diffusive waves to illustrate the external cloaking of light by star shaped domains. finally, we draw interesting consequences of non linear transform for the application of smooth isotropic lenses, such as the ability to detect diffusive anisotropies, that still retain their singularity under geometric transform.
the role of micro - turbulence and self - generated turbulence in collisionless guide - field magnetic reconnection is investigated. using a mean - field approach, we derive effective resistivity @xmath0, parametrized by a generalized ohm s law, for two - dimensional collisionless turbulence. we find that in strong guide fields, the electric field balanced due to the quasi - collision term of the boltzmann equation is negligibly small near the x - line of reconnection. as obtained by other methods, the correlated fluctuations in the field and plasma fluctuations are most important near the ` ` low density separatrices '', where the momentum transfer is isotropic. we calculate the contributions to the balanced slowly - varying ( mean ) electric field in the framework of the generalized - ohm - s law using another independent method, i.e., calculating the first order correlations of the scattered electric field and the turbulent plasma fluctuations. the resulting slowing - down rate of the current, if attributed to an effective ` ` collision frequency '', ranges from the ion - cyclotron to the lower - hybrid frequency. the bulk of the energy exchange between the particles and the mean, averaged over the turbulence, electric fields, is ` ` patchy '' in space and oscillating in time due the unstable plasma waves caused by a counterstreaming electron - ion instability. the inertia term is, however, comparable to the pressure and the convective electric field terms. for small but non - zero guide fields the electron inertia term provides a non - negligible effect on the balancing of macroscopic electric fields. we investigate further the contribution of the kinetic - scale turbulence to the turbulent mean quantities. in the case of antiparallel reconnection, we found that the kinetic scale turbulence provides only a small contribution to the total mean electric field. the form of the anomalous resistivity, calculated under the assumption that the relevant fluctuations are local and fast fluctuations, was found to be in agreement with previous observations. this result can be explained, at least qualitatively, by the choice of the particle - in - cell ( pic ) code for the time - window width of the window which has a very narrow opening width.
we examine the limit of solutions of the second - grade fluids equations under the vanishing @xmath0 limit of euler-@xmath1 and the vanishing viscosity limit of the navier - stokes system in the presence of a boundary layer. we obtain three different results concerning this limit. first, we prove that, under appropriate conditions on regularity and convergence of initial data, solutions from euler equations in space, uniformly in time, converge to corresponding solutions of i ) the euler system in a whole space, i.e., this limit is equivalent to vanishing of the energy dissipation rate in a region near the boundary, and ii ) the smallness condition on the initial velocity vanishes. this condition can be interpreted as a differential extension of kato s criterion, originally introduced in [ 2ndgradeth ], which is an extension of the original result obtained in [ 3dmgrenforschung ] for the weakly viscous case. in addition, we obtain a new result in another direction, namely, for the case @xoultruemm, which gives a sharp convergence result different from the one obtained by kato for the strong coupling problem. lastly, we give a qualitative interpretation of a recent result obtained by hirota et al. [ phys. rev. lett. * 106 *, 120401 ( 2009 ) ], where it is proved that solutions to the third euler - euler equation converge to solutions of thomas - fermi equations. in the first two parts of the paper, we briefly survey the regions of validity of our first three results, and we conclude that our results provide a natural way to treat a natural family of problems which formally interpolates between these situations. the conference presentation is based on the theme ` ` looking beyond the hydrodynamics '', a topic which has gained much attention in the recent years. the paper is organized as follows : in the following order, starting with the numerical analysis of the sobolev space of the vector fields, we present some preliminary results concerning the limit ; in the next section we compare our results obtained in the present direction with previous results due to kato ; and in the final section we present the results obtained via the identity and regularity criteria, as well as results of our own, yielding some useful insight into the connection between these two cases.
we investigate the relationship between globular clusters and the diffuse stellar populations of two nearby elliptical galaxies : ngc 1399 and ngc 4486. new washington photometry of the globular cluster systems in these two galaxies is used to derive surface brightness profiles and areal density profiles at galactocentric distances larger than 120 arcsec. we also analyse ( b - i ) colours from washington ( c - t@xmath0 ) photometry and produce colour histograms for each cluster subpopulation. a new colour metallicity relation is derived by combining the gcs surface brightness profile, the galaxy colour gradient and the [ fe / h ] distribution with corresponding data from the literature. we look for a red / blue _ population _ relation in the sense that globulars in brighter galaxies are bluer than those in fainter galaxies. this is consistent with the presence of a ` ` blue '' ( as opposed to ` ` red ) gcs population in some bright ellipticals. however, we find that the relation breaks down at a _ depth _ of @xmath1 0.35 sd, below the detection limit of the washington data. in this low mass environment, while the blue globular subpopulations are very prominent in the surroundings of bright galaxies, the red cluster population is considerably smaller than the blue cluster population. this result suggests that the two may have formed through different channels, possibly through different early stages of galaxy formation, perhaps with different initial conditions. we further explore a possible relation between the number of gcs per associated diffuse stellar mass unit and the abundance z distribution of the diffuse population. we find evidence for a correlation between these two quantities on the ` ` scale of the cluster '' defined by the @xcite ( t=1.1 - 0.4 dex ). in the context of our model, this correlation is shown to lead to a residual in the relation that can not be reproduced by a linear relation. it is also shown that a similar ` ` inflection '' is observed in the colour - metallicity relation for the ( luminosity weighted ) diffuse stellar population in the two galaxies when red clusters are considered.

future surveys of large scale structure, such as the dark energy survey, will require accurate fitting of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. as a step toward being able to distinguish the two models, we test the existing fitting formulas and propose a new one with much improved accuracy. in this work, we also compare the performance of the fitting formulas when applied to general dark energy models. we find that the cumulative shift of the bao peaks due to nonlinear evolution is about an order of magnitude, and that it does not depend on the parameters.

distributed networks play a crucial part in maintaining any strong connectivity structure between hub nodes, or nodes with high bandwidth / communication. healing algorithms seek to efficiently and responsively maintaining global invariants in a localized, distributed manner. several algorithms have been designed to obtain self - healing and increasing sophistication has bounded this cost by restricting the number of edges that can be deleted / added. however, none of the works appeal to the concept of _ minimizing _ the edge _ deletions _ of the network, at any healing stage. the most recent algorithm, and arguably the best for this problem, suffers from requiring deletion of edges with _ every _ possible local healing step. in this paper we introduce a novel consideration for healing algorithms, motivated by the cost associated with switching physical network communication lines, and show that it can preserve or increase a number of desirable global properties, including connectivity, diameter, degree constraint, network stretch and expansion. we generalize and strengthen previous algorithms to consider edge - preservation, and in particular maintaining or increasing all subgraph densities. this work makes a strong case for the general phenomenon of _ edge - preserving _ healing, and of the need to minimize the impact of a failure by adding subgraph density to the list of desirable properties. we are able to not only prove all the previous guarantees on all other requirements, but also show that edge - Preservation immediately leads to several very desirable global characteristics. density is an important example of such a property. it measures the _ strength _ of a set of nodes by the graph induced on them from the overall structure. the power of density lies in the ability to assess and better maintain the strength between specified ( or all ) subsets of nodes. consider for example a subset of nodes @xmath0 of a subgraph defined as its induced density. we will use the defined density of vertices when talking about resilience to random connectivity. in the context of our algorithm, it is important to have a larger number of connections between nodes than is common in the general case of distributed networks.
the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) has measured polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at the decoupling epoch, @xmath0. the resulting cross - correlation power spectra can be used to determine the structure and evolution of the universe, as well as the primordial matter distribution. in this paper we present the first direct measurement of the predicted pattern of adiabatic scalar fluctuations in cmb maps. we stack the polarization data around temperature hot and cold spots to show the expected polarization pattern at the statistical significance level of 8@xmath1. since there is no acoustic oscillation for tensor modes, we is unable to detect a modulation of polarization patterns around temperature spots on small angular scales. the detection of large - scale temperature polarization rules out any causal models as the primary source for generating the cmb fluctuations. we find a strong correlation between the temperature pattern and the polarization pattern, which can be interpreted as a vestige of the early universe, where the potential for generating non - gaussian fluctuations was greater. this interpretation allows us to impose the tightest constraints yet on the cosmological parameters : the angular scale of primordial helium abundance, the mass of clusters of galaxies, and the universality of the sz effect. by fitting the 7-year cmb temperature and polarization data to the same power spectrum used above, we improve limits on properties of neutrinos by a factor of 2 in the best - fitting model. also, adding the small - scale cmb data improves the limit on primordial helioseismology. lastly, we discuss implications of the temperature - polarization cross power spectrum for the particle physics model. the cross spectrum offers the best opportunity to probe the physics of dark energy and the fundamental constants of nature. limits on dark energy from the temperature data are discussed in the context of the standard model.
the broad absorption line ( bal ) spectrum of the radio quasar 3c 288.1 ( 3c 270.1 ) is used to estimate the power, @xmath0, of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ). in the radio loud quasar ( rlq ) universe, a strong bal is not uncommon. however, this was not the case in the nearby field of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) where the bal was found to have a prominent redward asymmetric feature. from the sdss civ line profile, we estimate the following : ( 1 ) there is a deficit of civ relative to ovi by a factor of 2. this is consistent with the lack of extended radio emission in this source. ( 2 ) the ovi absorption is stronger associated with the radio lobe emission ( lobe to lobe ) than with the civ emission. ( 3 ) the mgii line, combined with the ciii ] and mgii broad components, can be used to determine the disk luminosity,, of a radio loud agn. we find that the bolometric luminosity is too high to be related to the power of the agn as it is calculated on the basis of the bal spectrum. this contrasts with the results of uv measurements of the same source that show a large mgii absorption component. in this paper, we also use the radio jet power to make a mass estimate for the central black hole, using the method of @xcite. this method allows us to quantify the importance of the disk in generating the observed jet power. in addition, the real time jet power is quantified and the wealth of information on the jet properties available in the literature can be utilized to improve the determination of the accretion disk parameters. a very high degree of scatter is found in the data making this source a modest outlier in the recent literature.

the time evolution of a large set of coherent states of the angular momentum is discussed. the coherent states have been classified in the literature using a boson representation. we show that they are a particular set of circular states and do not contain the parameter @xmath0. the main question is whether the fractional wave packets are clones or just resemblant to the initial ones. despite all efforts to concentrate initially the wave packet in the best possible way, the quantum evolution destroys the concentration ( spatial localization ) according to the rule formulated in @xcite. we will show in this paper under which conditions the wave packets separate into clones and in which conditions there is a more restricted scenario of partial revivals. we also show the existence of new fractional waves with different shapes that we call mutants. the cases where cloning occurs is somewhat obvious, however it is interesting to define properly the time windows during which a given system of clones governs the time evolution. the carpet representation used also elsewhere is shown to be an interesting tool in the respect. when the number of parameters is reduced, the coherent state, which is now a three dimensional system with two quantum numbers, presents clones if the ratio of the amplitudes of the moments of inertia is rational. in the case when this ratio is not a rational number the mixture of the rational and the cubic terms is exactly determined. the universal scenario is discussed here for the linear and elliptic coherent states. it is shown that after a proper choice of the axis of coordinates, only spherical harmonics with magnetic number is needed to generate a suitable infinite well. moreover, we describe a full quantum - mechanical description of the transition between the circular and the elliptic wp. the most spectacular event of cloning has been found essentially for the infinite square well in one dimension and for the symmetric rotor in two dimensions. examples of vibrational wave packets in anharmonic potential of simple molecule are also discussed. # 1#2
we calculate the single excitation eigenvalues and eigenvectors of systems of @xmath0 identical qubits arranged at the vertices of regular polygons, and number them sequentially around the polygon. these states form the basis set within which the population dynamics and spectroscopic properties of the system are most conveniently and accurately studied. we show that in the long - wavelength limit these eigenstates turn out to be subradiant, with absorption spectra due to absorption by a single excited state, and to be damped at short wavelengths. in this way they form a useful resource for the identification of long - lived states desirable for quantum computing. the study of polygon systems of interacting qubits has been a subject at the forefront of quantum information theory for a long time, and is the subject of current interest also due to the possibility of observing single qubit oscillations in such systems @xcite. the interest is in systems in which the interaction between two qubits is dominated by the retarded multipole - multipole interaction, a general property of exchange interactions which half the work we must do when considering systems of pairs of qubits. such systems may well be of interest in their own right, and we are interested in comparing our results with those obtained for a system in which there are different strengths of the dipole - dipole interaction ; for this purpose we use the example of identical two - level atoms undergoing radiative transitions. a considerable amount of work has been done in order to understand how a simple arrangement of a few qubits can lead to so many interesting properties, in particular useful for quantum information processing. on the one hand, this is certainly a motivation for further developments in quantum computing, while on the other hand it offers an environment in which to study strongly correlated systems in an entirely new way. one of the most distinct features of present day quantum computing is the ability to easily scale up to many qubits, reducing the number of required interactions between qubits to a few. it has been shown that by extending the system of an odd number of symmetric and antisymmetric polygons ( often called polygons ), it is possible to encoding quantum information in a form which is robust both to the perturbations of the environment and to the effects of fluctuations in the physics of the systems involved. such a quantum information interface may allow, for example, the transmission of information via an optical waveguide to ; in principle, it may also allow the storage and processing of quantum states of light,
the advent of massive bollywood data, collected for a span of 60 years from the movie repository websites @xcite, has unfolded unprecedented spectroscopic properties of the bollywood industry. we find that the recently generated data do not follow goe statistics and that the top 10 actors from the list of filmfare award nominees occupy a distinct position in the unfolded spectra compared to the same number of nodes in unweighted networks. the ratio of their award nominations for consecutive spans is found to be an increasing function of the time span of the dataset. further we observe a strong increase in the rank of top ten actors from consecutive five - year spans indicating their continued success as an actor. acting in more than one film is considered to be a prestigious tradition in the industry. this and the success of the indian film industry has been demonstrated through various metrics such as box office numbers, box office profit, sizes of films hitched to the top of box office rolls, etc., in which working more frequently with a larger number of actors is considered an indication of higher achievement. the lack of statistics in bollywood has also suggested that the film industry is not the totality of the universe but merely a small fraction of it. we take this opportunity to address this issue and develop a new statistic, the basis of which is the probability distribution @xmath0 of the top ten ( top 50 ) actors in every 5-year time span. we show that it is not sufficient to know the statistics of the past to expect the future and predict macroscopic properties. using the framework of complex networks theory, we infer that the probability of an actor achieving certain degree of success in a certain time span is larger than that of a non - actor, implying that there is a greater probability to find high degree connections to the future generation of stars in the long term. * keywords * : bollywood, filmfare, indian industry, weighted bollywood networks, complex networks
the spectrum allocation for inter - operator device - to - device ( d2d ) communication in the 5th generation ( 5 g ) wireless networks is subject to the available spectrum, i.e., the shared radio access network ( ran ). in cellular mode, accordingly, the average numbers of users over sub - bands allocated for each transmission mode are the same. hence, the proposed strategy update algorithm facilitates the transfer of spectrum between the two devices. in this paper, we consider the inter - operation of a non - cooperative game, where the amount of spectrum every is willing to contribute to the shared band is determined by the weight sum of its individual utility, and the offers are exchanged by an iterative algorithm with a proper update parameter. we show that an with a careful selection of update parameter can converge to a unique equilibrium with an arbitrary number of users, enabling an to set the reliable but myopic strategy in a distributed manner. using the proposed solution, users with different intra - operator loads can experience performance gains compared to the baseline scheme where the do not share spectrum. the performance is evaluated for different utility designs, weighted utility function, and weighted proportional fair. 99 r. essiambre and r. w. tkach, ` ` ` spectrum allocation in 5 g, '' ieee j. sel. top. quant. elec. * 20 *, 401, ( 2016 ). l. zhang, l. yu, z. liu, q. zhu, s. wang, p. howe, n. l. steele, and jr.

we present a comprehensive study of the small main - belt binary asteroid ( 939 ) isberga using optical, near - infrared, visible and infrared photometry and spectroscopy, and thermal modeling to determine its surface composition, orbital parameters, mass, size, and geometric visible albedo. we model the primary component of the system using a uniform ellipse with an eccentricity of @xmath0, while the secondary is modeled as an ellipsoid with a semimajor axis of approximately 8@xmath1. we search for the best - fit solution by comparing the correlated flux with the effective brightness distribution, i.e., the cross - section equivalent diameter, to the effective longitudinal size, diameter, and primary oblateness. the binary orbit is found to be consistent with the short - period, eccentricity - limited orbital motion of the primary. we determine an orbital period of 3.173.3 days and a semi - major axis of 6.8@xfig.12h. we report the presence of a secondary lightcurve elongated along the ecliptic direction of the mutual orbit, which agrees well with the ephemeris derived from optical observations. thermal modeling shows that the satellite has a total mechanical energy of 0.14@zmath0 and a mass of 1.2@xft/10.1 kg. in comparison with the solar system, this is the highest mass - to - light ratio for an asteroid of this size and for any taxonomic type. we estimate the asteroid mass from the correlation of the optical and infrared fluxes and from thermal modeling, assuming that the primary and the secondary are located at the same distance. we find that the distance is 5.8 %, 4.1 %, and 0.7 % for the primary, secondary, and long - period lightcurves, respectively. our best - fitting model has the following characteristics : a ( logarithmic ) effective temperature, a radius of 70 au, dark graybody radius of 2.3 au, and a total mass of 9.3@x mathcalculated as a function of optical luminosity and absolute magnitude. the systematic uncertainty on the diameter estimate is 510 %, but this uncertainty is reduced to 33 % if we assume different values of the systematic uncertainties in the absolute magnitude and the binarity of the orbit. taking into account the observed binarity, this yields a diameter of 10.5@xogg20.1 km, within the range of possible
we present iso and isocam observations of the 158 fine structure line at @xmath0 of the interacting system ngc 4038/39, using the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ). the line is detected over the optical extent of the system and peaks at the interaction zone, close to the central region of the antennae. total emission is measured in co and co@xmath1. we find that the 158 line is typical of the emission from photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) created by far - ultraviolet photons from young stars and that it is not produced by the starburst regions surrounding the galaxies. the estimated pdr mass and the required total hydrogen mass for the pdrs are about 15 % and 8 % of the total estimated star formation mass in the two galaxies, respectively. we estimate far - uv uv luminosities from the co isotopes for the entire system and use it to estimate the star formation rate, sfr, and energy for the interaction region. for the nuclei we assume a lower value of the sfr and an sfr of about 10 %. we study a possible contribution of emission from the wnm, eldwim and possibly from ionized gas to the total emission. we also study a maximum of the observed emission from thermal emission derived from infrared radiation in the framework of a model with two star forming regions and an inter - component medium with a starburst and a quiescent surrounding molecular cloud system. the thermal emission can be attributed to dust heated by the interaction of the young galaxy with the intracluster medium, i.e. by the ionizing photons emitted by the young starburst. in this model the infrared emitting region is hotter and clumpier than the surrounding medium and therefore it can not be a pdr. if the infrared continuum is attributed to thermal emission from moderately warm dust we estimate the peak emitting area of the ionized medium to be about 40 % for the nuclear region, less than that from the inter - clump region. we constrain the ratio of the 15 to 6.7 continuum intensities, and deduce that the 15 continuum is probably dominated by clumpy emission from hot gas in the region between the two nuclei. the equivalent width of the 6.6 continuum is a factor of 3 higher than in the milky way and can be explained in terms of the combined effect of the jet and molecular clouds.
we present the first detailed imaging and spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic study of the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) g292.20.5, associated with the high - magnetic field pulsar psr j1119@xmath386127, using _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations. the selected regions with respect to the pulsar and its associated point source nebula ( pwn ) are the regions closest to the snr shell and its reverse shock. diffuse emission is present from the snrs eastern and western sides. the non - thermal emission from snr east is fainter than that from the western side and is dominated by hot plasma, best described by an absorbed plane - parallel shock, non - equilibrium ionization model ( vpshock ) covering the entire remnant width. the temperature of the hot plasma ranges from 0.2 kev to 3.3 kev, and the ionization timescale is less than 1000 s. in snr west, the emission from the reverse - shocked region is consistent with optically thin ism, suggesting that its emission arises from the supernova blast wave or other shocked circumstellar matter. an elongated and bright limb is particularly visible in the west, which partially coincides with the remnant shell seen in the radio, suggesting a possible interaction with a nearby cloud. the region to the north - east coincides with a dark cloud catalogued by hartley et al. ( 1986 ) and another, previously uncatalogued, dark cloud to the south - east. the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observations towards the eastern side of the remnant are needed to confirm or rule out any interactions with a molecular cloud. this, together with the evidence for ejecta, supports the notion that most snrs are formed via the interaction between a stellar jet and its accompanying pwn. although we can not rule out the possibility of shock acceleration at the pwn, there is no evidence so far that tev or oh maser emission can originates from this region. we find, however, that this emission can not be attributed to particles injected by the pulsars ; either the expansion of the region, the leakage of high - energy particles over a distance of @xmath1720 kpc, or the presence of a synchrotron component.

in this paper, we present the first high - resolution neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observation of the isolated, edge - on, infrared - bright galaxy ngc 3044. the galaxy is at a distance of 16.14@xmath0 kpc and has a neutral hydrogen mass of @xmath1. we find distinct evidence of hi arcs and extensions and high latitude features away from the plane of the galaxy. the kinematic major axis is parallel to the optical major axis to within one degree out to a radius of about 50@xfig2 kpc ( 4@xft ). the disturbance near feature 10 is interpreted as a galactic warp rather than a simple warp. channel maps reveal the asymmetric distribution of gas in the galaxy, which we highlight in figure [ f2b ]. the hi distribution is consistent with being gaussian in the plane and exponential in the z - direction. however, we find that the distribution of hi spectral lines is asymmetric over the entire galaxy, with the best fit consistent with a gaussian ring density distribution in the northwestern ( nw ) side of the disk. this is particularly remarkable in view of the fact that the radio continuum emission extends to much further than the hi features. there is also an apparent correlation between the hi and radio continuum features. finally, in order to get a better estimate of the energy of the hi shells and to examine the energetics of the formed supershells, we also explore the possibility of including surrounding massive clouds in the model. we conclude that the energy estimates, under the assumption of instantaneous input, are order of magnitude values. impacting cloud models are an attractive way to explain the origin of large, energetic supershell s, however, whatever the mechanism which created them, it must be energetic enough that the features are able to break through the moderately thick hi disk to reach the halo. galaxies : fundamental parameters galaxies : kinematics and dynamics galaxies : interactions radio continuum : galaxies
we present a set of stellar chemical evolution models for the galaxy, based on eight different yields, to investigate the behavior of the c / o gradient in the milky way and the c enrichment of the solar vicinity due to stellar evolution. for all models we assume different sets of yields for both massive and low and intermediate mass stars ( lims and ms ). we compare the predicted c yields from models 1 and 2 with the observed abundances of c, o, and ne, as well as the fraction of n in the interstellar medium ( ism ), to constrain the importance of both types of stars in the production of c and examine their influence on the evolution of the galactic halo. the main features of the models presented in this paper are the following five points : i ) we adopt an o / h ratio of 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0o@xmath10.08 + 0.3 ( 0.2 ) since the sun was formed, ii ) the ratio of n / o to c / h is 0.086/0.601, iii ) the c production rate is proportional to the star formation rate and to the rate of type ia supernovae ( sne ) contributing to c in the ism, in agreement with the recent observational data, and iv ) we use the present c / fe ratio to predict the fe / h values from metal - rich galactic regions at different galactocentric distances that are 0.1 to 0.4 dex smaller than observed. on the other hand, we use local data for dwarf unevolved f and g stars to obtain the n / h and n / fe values that predict a c enrichment history about 0.11.6 dex lower than that observed. we present the c and o abundances derived from ism that show a clear fit to the observations, namely : ( i ) c due to both major and minor production by ms and lims, ( ii ) fe due to enrichment by both major production by fe, and ( iii ) n due to a decrease of the total n abundance ( from c+n+o ) with time, ( from 16+c + o + o ), ( iv ) the total c abundance divided by o, ( v ) the cumulative c enrichment fraction as a function of time ( from 10 gyr to 2 myr to 10 myr ago ). our models are able to reproduce at best part of the observed c, n, o and n abundances
we numerically solve the vlasov equation for a class of two - level systems that are believed to be trapped in the quantum spin hall states ( qsss ) of the lynden - bell violent relaxation theory. starting from an out - of - equilibrium initial condition, the system settles into a configuration characterized by a high average magnetization and a low average susceptibility for all values of the scalar parameter @xmath0. by enhancing the non - homogeneous phase of the model with an external field, the level of the magnetic field decreases smoothly to zero and the equilibrium is interpreted as a first order phase transition. performing such a systematic study allows us to assess in a systematic manner the behaviour of the system and to compare numerical results with the theoretical predictions. in the limit for infinite system size, the discrete model hamiltonian admits a rigorous continuous analogue. using the semi - lagrangian method with cubic spline interpolation, we find the line of transition for the system as a function of the parameters. for the case of no external field the observed line is the full black line. performing a systematic analysis of the numerical results, we show that the continuous transition provides a correct description of the whole qss diagram even for strong external fields. above the critical value of the field, below the transition line, the magnetic fields are reported to be negative. in contrast to this simple scenario, we study the high - energy regime above the line and find that the magnetic properties change distinctly from what is obtained in the low energy regime to that in the high energy regime. the possibility of describing in the qss regime a localized agglomeration of particles on a circle has been considered in the past as a possible means to deal with the problem of magnetized regimes @xcite. today, this amenability provides an alternative way to describe the dynamics of long - range interacting systems and has proven to be a valuable tool also in the study of the macroscopic properties of matter - waves. in this context, it is of great importance to understand the inner mechanisms by which magnetized systems lose their equilibrium properties and fall into the regime of strong ferromagnetic fluctuations. in turn, such fluctuations may help to explain the observed order of magnitude of the fluctuations as well as their overall lack of uniformity in the system. from a theoretical point of view, the complete characterization of the phenomena in the magnetized regime turns out to be quite challenging and quite different from that encountered in the homogeneous setting. a considerable amount of work has been done in
we present calculations of the power spectrum and metallicity / initial - mass - spectrum dependence of the mean intensity of the near infrared background ( nirb ) fluctuations, @xmath0, from large - scale cosmological simulations of cosmic reionization, coupled with radiative transfer, for several different stellar populations. for a given stellar population, we assume four different escape fractions of ionizing photons from halos, three from clusters of galaxies, and two from isolated stars. we find that the amplitude of fluctuations in the halos ( and the mean nirbe ) is mostly dominated by the ratio of the ionizing photon escape fraction to the stellar escape fraction for halos with a total mass greater than @xcite, while the angular power spectrum of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is consistent with the single power spectrum seen in the literature. the igm is typically a minor contributor to the overall fluctuations, although it can be comparable to the halo contribution ( the stellar contribution as well as the nebular contribution from within a halo ), especially if the escape fraction of photospheric electrons is high. when we average over all stellar populations, we find a power spectrum that is roughly symmetric, with a mean power law index of 1.4, though there is a broad range of shapes. the peaks in this power spectrum fall between regions of high ionization rate and high star formation efficiency, and are likely to be from stars forming at the highest redshifts. we give approximate analytic formulas for luminosity - density power spectra and show that these formulas are capable of providing accurate predictions even for stars that have primordial abundances. we note, however, that these analytic formulas are subject to uncertainties in the star formation time scale and the mass to light ratio of galaxies. changes in these parameters will change the overall shape, but will allow us to probe the ionization history through the fractional anisotropy, i.e., the mixing of metal - rich and metal - poor stars.

we present deep multicolor @xmath0 images of the powerful, compact, high redshift 3cr radio galaxy lbds 53w002 ( windhorst, van heerde, & katgert 1984a ), taken with the planetary camera 2 on the vla 8.4 ghz telescope. the radio galaxy is shown in its entirety in four components : a compact ( f450w ) component the center of an extended starlight distribution and an extended pair of clouds roughly aligned with the projected radio axis, as well as a smaller ` ` ` cloud '' seen near the nucleus, which we interpret as a reflection cone from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ). the eastern component is resolved into several small clouds, including a compact radio source about 02 from the core, an extended blue cloud surrounding it, and a very small red cloud that is elongated perpendicular to the nucleus but not perpendicular to it. the western cloud contains a small, steep spectrum, a medium - to - high efficiency radio jet, and is extended in the same direction as the eastern cloud. this jet - induced star - formation could have been triggered by the compact star - forming cloud or by other physical processes. the scattered light from an agn could be a significant fraction of the total flux in the radio source, as evidenced by the fact that the aligned blue clouds and the radio jet are seen nearly perpendicular to each other. the combined structure suggests that the agn and its surrounding clouds are probably co - located, although the extent of the co jet is not well defined, due to the size of the reflection cones. the overall coherent star formation activity seen in this radio galaxy may have been induced by the interaction between the jet and these surrounding clouds, as shown by the co emission lines. the aligned cloud is significantly bluer than the surrounding cloud, implying that it contains a substantial amount of gas and/or dust well beyond the optical extent of these galaxies. based on the size and morphology of the red cloud, we suggest that it is a globular cluster in the final stages of its assembly.
this paper describes several numerical algorithms for the evaluation of pswfs and related quantities, as well as for the construction of quadrature rules, interpolation formulas, etc. for the last 15 years substantial progress has been made in the design of such algorithms - especially in the area of bandlimited functions. in this paper, we describe several pswf - based algorithms and design a new class of psc - based quadratures for the integration of band limited functions. while the analysis is somewhat involved and will be published separately, the resulting numerical algorithms are quite simple and efficient in practice. for example, the computation of the @xmath0th eigenvalue of the prolate integral operator of a bandlimited function defined on an interval has been reported in the literature already several times. one of principal goals of this paper is to describe a class of generalized gaussian scalar functions that for the first time extend the classical euclid algorithm for polynomial division can be used as a computational tool. for this purpose, we define three ( and possibly four ) pswfr terms that are ` ` ` related '' to the ring of integers, ` ` bandlimited '' functions defined on the interval, which are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the corresponding functions ( under certain symmetric tridiagonal conditions ). we refer to such relations as ` ` pswfts. '' one of the main technical features of the paper is that we describe a new and quite accurate family of pshefflin - schwinger - wolf - salpeter - weinberg - free parameters that are needed for accurate evaluation of the periodic table of positionals. in other words, we show that pshelf functions are not ` ` quasiparticles '', but rather ` ` polytopes ''. we also describe a general algorithm that computes for pshelvin coefficients of an infinite series interpolation problem via a convex iterative algorithm that resembles the classical interpolative algorithm for the compreting power law of a prolate differential operator. to the best of our knowledge, at least three of the four algorithms presented here are the first ones ( see theorem [ thm_tridiagonal ] below ) ; the analysis and numerical results are quite involved, so we will provide more details in the sequel papers of this series. also, we report some numerical results obtained via numerical experiments. _ ams 2010 subject classification _ : primary 60j67 ; secondary 60j70 ; keywords : _ quad

the properties of two massive star forming regions, iras 19111 + 1048 ( g45.12 + 0.13 ) and iras19110 + 1045, which are respectively formed in the hubble deep field ( h ii ) and the galactic star forming complex, have been studied using the infrared and radio observations. the regions have also been probed in the ultraviolet mid and far infrared to gain insight into the evolutionary stages of these massive sources. from the radio maps, we have extracted the angular distribution of ionised gas, dust, and infrared colour - magnitude diagrams in these regions. the distribution of dust optical depths, dust temperatures and spectral types of zero age main sequence ( zams ) stars have been compared. we also present the radiative transfer models for the two iras sources. we have used the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) 2mass point source survey ( psc ) in the j, h and k bands to derive the slope of the near infrared ( nir ) colour magnitude diagram in the radio - wavelength range 1520 @xmath0 m. we find that s14 is a compact embedded cluster with an extent of 4.5@xmath1 ( 1.4 pc ). the low resolution radio maps at 1280, 610 and 325 mhz show the presence of several compact sources including two major outflows, one of which is associated with s14. the two radio sources, s14 and s27, are deduced to be of spectral types o6 and o7 from their positions in the nir colour magnitude diagrams. the zams spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of s14 indicates that it is a young star whereas that of s27 is an older star of spectral type b2. from radio observations, we find a ratio of infrared to radio flux density variations ( i.e. the s14 source is more extinction - dominated ) indicating that this h ii region is more advanced in terms of the number of zams stars present in the cluster. the properties of the two regions are compared using the radio and the infrared data.

we present a study of the flux probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the lyman @xmath0 forest from eight high resolution quasi - stellar object ( qso ) spectra obtained with the uves echelle spectrograph. the spectra have been imprinted with voigt profiles, and absorption lines arising from heavy elements have been carefully identified. we have then had the metal absorption lines removed from within the ly-0 forest, resulting in a joint sample of qso spectra covering a wide range of redshifts. we find that the removal of metal absorption from our full sample leads to a redshift dependent effect on the pdf, both before and after metal decontamination. we measure the pdf for the full sample in two redshift bins, and find that it is sensitive to the metallicity of the intergalactic medium ( igm ). the effect of removing metal absorption is seen to be larger for higher redshift. however, after correcting for metal absorption, the pdf measured with the metal removal is in agreement with the one measured from the previous results for lower redshift spectra. we also find that there is substantial deviation from the pdf of the weak power - law regime measured from our sample by kim et al. ( 2007 ). no strong trends with redshift are found for the pdf after removing metals, in contrast to previous results from smaller samples. to complete the picture, we also perform a series of hydrodynamical simulations to obtain constraints on the temperature and the thermal history of the igm. the resulting constraints are in good agreement with previous measurements, and are used to discuss the possible inversion of the temperature - density relation due to photo - ionization during the epoch of heii reionization. cosmology : theory dark matter, large - scale structure of the universe, galaxies : evolution stars : formation galaxies : high - redshift techniques : spectroscopic
we measure the relative abundances of silicon and carbon in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) by analyzing,, and pixel optical depths in a sample of 19 high - quality quasar absorption spectra. our fiducial model ( taken from haardt & madau 2001 ) is consistent with the observed ly@xmath0 abundance ratio, @xmath1, as obtained from previous studies. we find no evidence for evolution in the ratio, and infer a constant value using the simulation results in a hydrodynamical simulation. a harder uvb model ( using only the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background background ) gives a higher ratio, [ si / c ], than the one obtained from the full sample, but also gives a significantly larger uncertainty in the slope of the distribution of carbon abundances compared to silicon. all of the above models, considered in paper ii, predict a silicon - to - carbon abundance ratio near solar, and we find that the variation with solar abundance is small, consistent with solar values calculated by other authors. we give an estimate of the overall ( ionizing ) uv background background background slope, assuming a constant temperature and density of the igm, and find that it is too uncertain to draw strong conclusions from the slope alone. however, the overall range of slopes given by the models for a given overdensity and redshift for four different uvbs for the range of gas densities and overdensities we consider gives a range of values that are within the range allowed by the data. our results agree very well with simulations using a smoothly evolving, subsurface uv baryonic background, and do not require any special models for the shape or evolution of the uvib. to the extent that our data can be used to constrain the physical properties of the absorbing gas, they indicate that the thermal state of the system is fairly well - described by standard thermal diffusion equations. = 1
we present irac 8@xmath0 3 photometry for a sample of 196 spectroscopically confirmed lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in the hubble deep field north, obtained as part of the irac guaranteed time observations on 6 cosmological fields. using a revised version of the bruzual and charlot stellar synthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the thermal - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase, we use spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to derive the properties of the population. based on the best - fit model seds, we find stellar masses for the lbg sample range, which is @xmath040 % of the total estimated stellar masses. in addition, we determine the stellar masses of 196 lbgs in the present sample that have at least one irac detection. we show that using the updated models, the agb phase has a significant impact on the range of stellar masses derived for the population, particularly at the high - mass end. we find that in the sample population, which consists of lbgs with both uv and irac detections, the ratio of uv luminosities to stellar masses is higher at high redshifts. when we correct for the contribution of faint uv - faint galaxies without correcting for dust extinction we find no correlation between star - formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass. we do find a weak correlation, however, if we restrict our sample to star - forming galaxies with 9logm@xday ( 9@xfig0 m^2/m#xmath1 m ) as done by verma et al.

we re - examine the prospects for and problems associated with supersymmetric inflation in compactified string theories. the central question is whether acceptable inflation can occur in a natural way with no need for fine tuning or for multiple correlated periods of inflation. we argue that this is indeed the expectation in the presence of moduli fields, provided that their thermal production during reheating is under control. we consider the case of a ` chaotic'inflation where the potential is set by the original spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry. the scale of the resulting inflationary potential, @xmath0, agrees with the cobe bound on the reheat temperature when the scalar density perturbations are normalized to the planck scale. the need for substantial fine tuning is, however, not required to achieve a sufficiently flat potential. we then discuss whether it is possible to satisfy the other phenomenological constraints posed by the ` polonyi problem ', namely the required tensor component in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, in inflationary models which feature a single stage of dynamical symmetry breaking. we demonstrate that deviations from scale - invariance require fine tuning but that avoiding fine tuning altogether is not necessary. chaotic inflation does not produce large amounts of entropy in the process either. we discuss how this constraint emerges in the context of a hybrid model for chaotic inflation in which the dynamical evolution of new inflation is correlated with the initial conditions of chaotic inflation. as an example we consider supergravity inflation based on local supersymmetry describing the decay of kaluza - klein states. in this case the masses of the hidden sector inflaton are small compared to the observed masses of galaxies. the post - inflation production of gravitinos or other weakly coupled states can be substantial. we show that this can be realised in perturbative supergravity ` models'with only gravitational strength couplings. -2.5 cm # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4 )
we present a bayesian markov chain monte carlo method to fit realistic non - singular isothermal ( nfw ) triaxial dark matter halos to weak gravitational lensing data. this method allows for the straightforward and statistically robust inclusion of constraints from other data sources such as observations from sz, x - ray and spectroscopic surveys, and a combined weak and strong lensing analysis of the cluster ms2137@xmath0cdm. even without imposing any external constraints, the 3-d shape and orientation of the halo profile is given by a projection function from the 2-d projected mass density and a measurement of the lensing induced shear is included in the posterior probability distribution for each halo. we find that this model is consistent with @xmath1 of cluster - scale halos, under the assumption that the nfw profile is spherical and that the concentration parameter is fixed. the model is also able to reconcile a few high - concentration halos with the data, although it is only for a small fraction of halos. this suggests that highly traxial halos are much more efficient gravitational lenses than their more spherical counterparts, perhaps because of their ability to hide behind asymmetric orientations and small number statistics along the line of sight. we discuss the implications of this result for current studies of galaxy clusters, as well as lensing - based structure formation models.

we present 8.3@xmath0 m and 6 cm observations of the north polar spur ( nps ), a bipolar shell - like feature in the galactic center lobe ( gcl ) that is expected to be the result of starburst - driven winds from the supernova or agn activity. we find that dust is present over the entire gcl electromagnetic spectrum at all galactic latitudes, and that it is strongly entrained. we see clear evidence for cool dust temperature increases with increasing radius, which may be due to the entrainment of hot gas from the wind - blown shell gas interface. the gas at intermediate latitudes is characteristically hotter ( @xmath1 k ) and more redshifted than the gas towards the outer edge of the nps. this may be a physical manifestation of the extreme ionization conditions that have been observed in the gaseous haloes of edge - on spiral galaxies. the extended warm dust emission and the near - field dominated x - ray emission are consistent with heating by the stellar radiation field, and the observed constant emissivity of the infrared spurs, or the presence of a radiation - dominated hot gas at low latitude, both imply that the radiation field is strong enough to heat the dust and gas on the far side of the hypershell. we revisit sofue s earlier work on the np - related hypershell model in light of new observations. we show that the observed east and west spurs at 3 cm coincide precisely with the same features at 8@xft0 m. both are likely to arise from the same source. the spurs are also found at 6 and 11 cm and need not be thermal in origin. we now understand the gcl structure. the dynamical mass ejection of the interstellar medium from the bipolar shell is required to eject the gas and dust from the innermost 0.2 to 1.0 kpc in diameter. the intergalactic medium is too dense to eject material from the interior at a velocity of 130200. the transition gas may be clumpy or may be self - gravitationally bound. we also understand the complex ionization and kinematics of the wind. in particular, we show for the first time that the _ entire _ gcl is ionized by dust. possible mechanisms which can accelerate the wind are discussed.
searches for soft and hard interactions in exclusive vector meson ( v ) production at hera have been carried out. the measured cross sections contain the possibly transverse component of the virtual photon, which has to be modeled in perturbative qcd. the soft component is believed to be well described by regge phenomenology, according to which at high energy, the pomeron exchange dominates in the production of diffractive states. the observed discrepancy, however, can be understood if one assumes that exclusive v production proceeds through helicity conservation ( schc ). the schc parameters are known from measurements of total cross sections in hadron - hadron interactions and proton - proton electromagnetic scattering. the separation into the longitudinal and transverse components is governed by the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal virtual photon density matrix elements. for high @xmath0, the ratio is independent of the proton transverse momentum and, therefore, its dependence on the center of mass energy can be ascribed to the dependence of the sch non conservation amplitude on the total cross section. assuming that schc holds at all energy, and the relation between the total and longitudinal cross sections is fixed, the differential cross section for v production in deep inelastic scattering has been studied. the obtained results are compared with theoretical predictions of frankfurt et al. the data suggest a slight increase of the factorization constant of the linearized transverse virtual photon transition amplitudes with increasing@xmath1, but no significant deviation from the standard schc predictions. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 043issn 0418 - 9833 + march 2010 * diffractive semileptonic state production in * 1 *, 33 ( # 1 ) + kek - preprint -94 - 39 + september 2010 * elastic v production + in hera : results and perspectives * + _ institute of high energy physics, + the university of tennessee, knoxville, tn 37996 - 1200, usa _ + _ instituto de fsica corpuscular c.s.i.c./universitat de valncia + edificio de institutos de paterna, av. rovisco pais, p.o. box 513, 1049 - 0013 lisboa, portugal _ 1.0 cm
we study the correlation between the spectral hardness ( photon index ) and the quasi - periodic oscillation frequencies ( qpo ) observed in x - ray lightcurves of black hole ( bh ) candidates. we demonstrate that the index-@xmath0 correlation observed in a number of bh sources is a direct consequence of the existence of the innermost bulk motion region and, therefore, can be considered to be an observational signature of a bh. in particular, we show that the spectral evolution from the low - hard to high - soft states is characterized by a blackbody like pattern and also by the presence of a strong ` ` bulk motion '' comptonization ( bmc ) component. we present a monte carlo simulation of the evolution of these two spectral components together with the addition of a high energy cut - off ( _ bmc1 _ component ). the general picture of lhs, is, hss and vss transition is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ]. we consider the basic parameters for the model : reynolds number @xmath1 of accretion disk within the inner region of the converging flow region ( as derived from the scaling between the characteristic frequencies of the qpo frequencies and the soft component of the xspec model ), mass accretion rate @xcite and the spectral index. we find that there are three observed signatures of the bh spectral evolution : first, spectral hardness saturates when the source evolves towards a softer state, followed by a steep extended power law, then spectral index saturates and finally, the spectrum starts to become very soft. this saturation effect is observed for a broad range of parameters and is the result of the inclusion of a substantial amount of plasma free - fall accretion onto the central bh, which increases the inner compton thickness of the transition layer and shifts the transition from the hard to the soft state. second, spectral evolution is observed in _ rxte _ observations of gx 339 - 4, ss 433 and ssenna x-1. we argue that this can be interpreted in the context of the model of two inner flow components, with the inner and outer compton moving during the spectral transition, providing information on the dynamical evolution of the accretion flow in the transition region. finally, we suggest an interpretation of the broad lhs - is hss intermediate state spectral transitions.

we present the first high - resolution x - ray spectrum of the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. the spectrum, obtained with the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer, is rich in emission lines from all significant h - like and he - like ions. numerous higher - order series lines are also present, the relative amounts of which are completely explained by the addition of photoexcitation. our ability to simultaneously fit all ionic column densities, as well as the spectrum of isolated high - order - series lines, is a significant achievement. we discuss the geometrical / dynamical properties of the ionization cone, using a new method based on the comparison of binary line absorptions. here, all ions are assumed to have the same radial distribution, so that discrepancies between absorption measurements on individual lines can be conveniently removed. we also present measurements of the electron temperature and electron temperature of the warm plasma, both photoionized and photoexcited by the inferred nuclear continuum. for both warm plasmas, our fits are consistent with the conservative range of @xmath0 few ev. however, we do not provide the ratios expected for photoionizing the plasma and for hotter plasma in collisional equilibrium. we incorporate our model into the local model _ photo _ ( wilson & ulvestad 1982 ). alternatively, using the method employed by our model, we can irradiate all ions together in a single burst. this method, which allows for negligible photoelectric absorption and much better fits to the data, is consistent with recent results from observations of ngc 1108 and ngc 1210. in order to confirm the negligible effect of source size and position on the extracted rgs spectrum, we also analyze a cursory analysis of the pn image below.
we study the field - induced quantum phase transition of a clean antiferromagnetic metal in the presence of a finite magnetic field. we truncate the effective action, retaining the leading frequency and momentum dependence of the gaussian part of the action as well as a constant @xmath0 interaction term. we find that the critical behavior does not depend on the ratio of precession and damping terms. the only difference which changes is the sign of the leading correction. at large magnetic fields, it seems possible to suppress the staggered component of the magnetization by pressure or doping. in the absence of a magnetic field, this effect is strongly suppressed compared to contributions from the zeeman term near the quantum critical point. at small magnetic fields though, the spin precession term does not lead to a qualitative change in the scattering rate. we note that similar conclusions can be reached for other strongly correlated fluids. the concept of quantum criticality was first suggested by j. stasheff in the early days of quantum mechanics@xcite. the essential idea is to use external fields to influence the internal state of a system, in such way to mimic the effects of the external field. to date, a great deal of works have been devoted to quantum phase transitions of solid - state systems. these transitions take place near zero temperature superconductivity where, according to the theory, there is a gap between the idealized classical ( classical ) and experimental ( experimental ) states. in a certain class of transitions, the field effect is used to normalize the system beyond the critical limit. examples include metal - insulator transitions in which the critical point is located at rather large superconducting flux @xcite, metallic superconductors which are driven by chemical potentials which saturate the critical energy and make it possible to control the behavior from first principles. a recent development which has broaden the class of possible quantum phases is the measurement of of the neutron scattering cross section @xcit ; for example, it can be used to determine the spin - density of a gas of ultracold bosons moving at relativistic speeds@xcit. in this context, the scattering of electrons from spin - fluctuations is of great interest since it is directly related to observable quantities such as the specific heat coefficient and magnetoresistance. moreover, it is of practical importance to understand the interplay between these various effects as it is commonly assumed that the effective magnetic field enters via a zeeman - term. calculating the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat from a hertz - like solution, we
the composite string model is an extension of the conventional uniform string model to include a composite green - schwarz superstring. there are by now several analytical and numerical results showing the great adaptivity the model has with respect to various contour regularization methods. the main part of this review is devoted to an updated review of the main properties of the model at zero, and also at finite, temperature, concentrating on the case of the two - piece string. the dispersion relation is evaluated in terms of the green function, the casimir energy, and the hagedorn temperature, making use of the latest developments in quantum field theory. an interesting analogy is made between the composite string and the quantum star graph model. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 0=0 1= 1=1 0>1 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 1, apj, * # 3 *, # 4 ( # 2 ) [ 1 ] # 3 = 0 by 60 = 1bsphack@filesw gmbh, nucl. phys. b ( # 1 ), proc. suppl. of the f.d. astr. soc., # 1,#2(#3)#4 # 1@xmath0 # 1 hep - ph/9908417 + ens-99 - 009/99 - 241 + july 1999 + * composite string models : at zero and at finite temperature * + a. brevik and elizalde + _ department of physics, university of california, santa barbara, ca 93106 _ + _ e - mail address : brevik@phy.caltech.edu, p.o.box 193900, d.f.h.- bernardi, and l.u.- c. berthelot, ` ` a model for the vacuum state in a piecewise uniform superstring, '' phys. rev. lett. * 100 *, 080302 ( 2009 ). the web page of ibid., http://www.ibid.org/jnl/articles/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-10-3-801. ] + m.j. montiel i. de oliveira + _ dipartimento di matematica e fisica ` ` en formacin delluniversit e della ricerca '', universit di roma ` `
we present composite spectra of quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 5 and 7, and compare them with reference spectra, constructed from the sdss dr5 database, to determine if a damped lyman @xmath0 absorber ( dla ) is present in the quasar spectrum. we find that the minimum log n(hi ) value of the dust depletion levels measured for dlas is similar to that measured for the galactic diffuse ism, suggesting that most of the dlas observed in sdss have a very small dust content. we analyse the dla spectra by comparing their colours to the colours of background quasars, and bootstrapping the resulting broad distribution of colour excesses to ascertain the slightly redder colours of dla qsos. while our analysis is based on the largest sample of dlas ever studied, it is still possible that there exist dlas and/or sightlines that do exhibit an amount of wavelength dependent extinction, which is just too small to be detected when averaging over such large datasets. as a consequence, we do not identify any unambiguous signatures of dust reddening in our samples. while we do detect some evidence of extinction in the current sdss data releases ( e.g. dr7 ), these have not been confirmed by higher analysis. using the @xcite qso catalogue, we have compiled a sample of 526 qso sightlines with a previously unknown dla, from which we study the structure of the qso spectra in the rest - frame uv, via the analysis of a composite spectrum, for which we also produce the hi absorption line and the corresponding metallic line indices. we present a complete list of 1426 strong hi absorbers, at redshifts 2.15@xmath16 z @xik2, in this sdss sample of 9.37 @x0 0.1125, that show absorption lines indicative of a dla. we compare this list of absorption lines with the complete vladilo dla sample, and find that whilst the total number of detected dlas still does not allow us to determine the reddening of the entire qso sample, our analysis of the subsamples does rule out significant departures from a pure power - law model of the absorption line indices, which are claimed to be consistent with other methods and studies in the literature. = 6truein galaxies : high - redshift - galaxies : ism - intergalactic medium - dust, extinction
we have carried out a multi - wavelength study with 15-m swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ), of four iras point sources in the southern hemisphere, selected from the list of sources with colors of uc hii regions and detected in cs(2@xmath11 ) emission. the aim of these observations is to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of the molecular gas and dust in order to determine their physical conditions, kinematics, and chemistry. toward each of the iras sources we obtained data in the ranges of @xmath2oh, sio, carbon monosulfide, silicon monoxide, and methanol. we show that the massive cores investigated here are associated with clusters of embedded stars which exhibit clear mass segregation. the high - mass stars are found near the center of the core while intermediate mass stars have spread over much larger distances from the core center. the question arises as to whether the massive stars are formed in situ or if their spatial location is a result of dynamical effects. the cores have high densities, steep density profiles and sizes, together with the relatively low fraction of the total mass in the form of stars. dynamical friction produced by the gaseous background onto the stars is likely to play an important role in the orbital evolution of the stars. the sio line emission is detected toward all the observed star forming regions, with the strongest emission being observed toward the g330.949 + 0.174 core. sio lines are tracers of both the warm ambient gas surrounding young luminous stars and of molecular outflows associated with newly formed massive stars. we find that sio emission is relatively easy to detect, especially for distances of 0.5 - 1 pc, and that the derived physical parameters are consistent with the predictions of the turbulent and pressurized dense core accretion model. we also find that the dust continuum emission and the broad dust wings associated with the young embedded stellar clusters are broad enough to be detected in the dense gas. the spatial distribution of the dust and gas emission is consistent with infall motions suggested by co(t=2.11 ) observations, indicating that a luminous energy source has already formed inside the cores.

we introduce spin wavefunctions and orbital angular momentum eigenfunctions for semiclassical spin coherent states. these functions map the angular momentum vector of a spin coherent state into a map of the entire equator of the earth, or of the sphere if it is flat. they can also be used to visualize functions over the surface of a cut sphere, which involves a special kind of map known as the hammer projection. we discuss various applications including spinor rotation, the ` ` international dateline '', and larmor precession. the spin wavefunction for a state @xmath0 is an eigenstate of the _ vector _ spin operator, and the orbital wavefunction describes the distribution of circular waves around the equator. these states have received considerable attention in the literature, because of their unusual properties ( e.g., see @xcite for a review ). here we introduce them in a way that is formal, but which is at least as precise for computations. in particular, we present ( and review ) the heuristic heuristic model which describes the geometrical properties of a particle orbiting a circle. this model has a simple but effective description, requires no diagrams or diagrams, and is great for introductory courses in quantum mechanics. for another application, we discuss the dynamics of a landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski ( lgs ) particle. the lgs are remarkable because of its completely symmetric spin structure, in which circular orbits are forbidden ( the bloch theorem ), but where quantum fluctuations are allowed. the field has witnessed major steps forward in the last few years, thanks to the development of analytical and numerical tools. this is helped by the prospect of having a readily available class of theoretical spin operators, which will hopefully fill in the gap between the classical description and the more intuitive more general description. currently, there is considerable interest in such systems, both in the basic physics of lgs, as well as in potential applications such as quantum information processing@xcite. it is of particular interest to understand the complex patterns of spin rotation that appear whenever a particle crosses a loop at the larmor frequency, i.e., when the particle ` ` crosses the cross section '', which is the crossover between a spin spinning in a uniform magnetic field and a spin in a spinor magnetic field. the fundamental understanding of this phenomenon is still quite rudimentary, and it is often difficult to visualize spin functions in the classroom. we describe techniques for visualizing spin functions
we study the dynamics of an arbitrary non - homoclinic tangle possessing an unstable fixed point @xmath0 and a stable and unstable manifolds attached to it. the local topology of the tangle produces a saddle - center map, which we assume to have an area- and orientation - preserving diffeomorphism. the main result of the paper is the epistrophe theorem, which proves and elaborates upon earlier work by tiyapan and jaffaff, that every map possessing such a tangle is asymptotically self - similar and is thereby epistropotically related to each other. in particular, we show that the escape - time plot diverges in a recursive fashion ; we characterize the tails of the epistrophes with geometric quantities. we use the term ` ` epistrophic self - similarity '' to describe the above situation where additional escape segments, or ` ` strophes '', exist that persist throughout the time plot. we prove the existence of a certain class of epistropheirs : those that, up to a rescaling, are sufficiently well - behaved that they even tend to dominate the concentrate plot in the long run 2 escape segments. in addition, we give a partial characterization of additional set of escape segments that are not part of the minimal set. numerical evidence seems to indicate that these extra escape segments tend to be long - lived and dominant on all scales ; it may be well known that there are many, but not all, such escape segments which do not belong to any given epistrophe. on the other hand, we find that there is a partial predictability in the tails ; indeed, as we move from one epistrophe to another, there are segments which are partialually distinct from each other but which nevertheless manage to survive in the early phase of the map. this suggests that there may be additional structured structures at higher dimensionality, which are perhaps even dominant on some scales, such as phase - space transport.
we present a study of the x - ray agn population in five low surface brightness superluminosity environments ( lsss ) : the cl1604, cl1324, rxj1821.6 + 6827, the cl0023 + 0423 supergroup, and the green valley. the redshifts of these structures are @xmath0 = 0.43.2, 0.42.1, and 0.07. we have compiled extensive multi - wavelength datasets for each structure ( ` ` unevolved '' ), including optical imaging data, radio data obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ), and near - ir data from the keck telescope millimeter array ( stm ). we examine the properties of the agn host galaxies using composite spectra that include the and h@xmath2 emission lines. we find that agns in all five structures exhibit star formation or have had recent starbursts. however, agn activity is preferentially associated with the lower redshift of the objects, in agreement with previous studies. we classify the galaxies into four subpopulations : isolated, passive, star - forming, blue, and red quiescent galaxies. for all four of these subsets, we find at least one agn member, associated with a cluster or group of a known member. two of these systems are newly confirmed agn members and one is spectroscopically confirmed as a companion to a member of an interacting supergroup. combining our results with other studies suggests that the largely unresolved agn problem in lss is partially due to the poorly constrained environment of the lss. in contrast to the single member galaxies of the isolated clusters, the hosts of the evolved agns are dominated by massive, early - type galaxies. additionally, all agns hosted by relaxed, late - type groups or clusters with large velocity dispersions are metallicity enhanced with regard to that of the average galaxy in these structures. we do not find any significant structural differences between the subsets of agn hosts, however, in the cumulative source counts and spatial distributions of the hosts. this suggests that, regardless of whether they are members of the evolving or quyingcent structures, _ all _ agn spectra are younger than the average galaxies in their parent population. we also find a large ( two orders of magnitudes ) variation in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev luminosities of agns between the evolved and non - evolved structures
we give a self contained introduction to projective automorphisms of the linear forms of the surfaces of crystallographic groups acting on grassmannians with shephard - todd ideals in the cohomology subspace of a non - trivial form. we discuss some examples and applications, focussing on the intersection singularities of the intersection form. the subject is briefly studied in section [ ssmosym ]. for @xmath0, the main result is an elementary proof of m. prhofer et al. s conjecture concerning the existence of kernel splitting in the modular cases of proposition [ pproj ]. we also give an alternative proof in the one - dimensional case for which the kernel is shared by two character subspaces of the same kernel. the study of linear crystallographic group actions on non - linear surfaces is a blooming field of study, but a starting point for the understanding of complex crystallographic structures in geometry and topology. this subject is particularly interesting in view of the general problem of the division of the grassmannian of a group by its sections, a problem which has received a large attention in the last years @xcite. the aim of the present paper is to provide a general solution to this problem in the form of constructions of a few non - smoothable symmetries for the linear surfaces of a single - projective crystallographicgroup. the construction can be done in one of two ways. firstly, by means of simplifying the geometry, one can identify non - singular invariants not present in the general setting. for example, the relationship between the kernel of an intersection form and its finite homology is difficult to establish. secondly, one may be interested in determining whether a given set of invariants is present when the kernel and its homology are different rank. in this case, one avoids the problems associated with the kernel - homology splitting in modular cases, which are in general difficult to study. them we aim to address here is the latter problem. we will solve this problem for the two - level projective version of the question by using algebraic techniques. for the first approach, we consider the following groups : * a real semi - direct product of two non - parabolic linear forms * * a hermitian subvariety of these two subvarieties * * an riemann surfaces with kernel splitting * m. j. verhoef and m. a. harris * + _ mathematics department, university of maryland, + college
in the past two years, tremendous progress has been achieved in understanding the linear controllability of complex nonlinear - dynamical networks. in particular, geometrical and topological approaches have been used to determine the conditions under which a system is controllable. however, we have encountered unexpected difficulties in actually controlling complex networks, particularly when it comes to the question of the minimum number of driver nodes required to steer the system from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary final state in finite time. in this paper, we articulate the issue of control in terms of the ` ` control energy '', i.e., the number of control signals, @xmath0, that are needed to ensure actual control. the problem is that, quite often, the actual control of the system is difficult to be achieved computationally in the sense that in any finite time, it is not possible to drive the system to any one of several possible states. this conundrum has implications for the design of better control strategies for complex networks and we resolve the paradox by considering the problem of control chains, in which the fat - tail distribution of the control energy is determined by the structural properties of the network. we develop a theory that enables us to offer simple strategies to significantly reduce the needed control energy through small modifications to the network properties. to obtain the right control energy, we apply the theory to a real network. for this network, we identify three conditions : the condition number of the constituent nodes is singular, the energy diverges, but is maximized above a certain critical value, signalling the existence of a ` ` critical '' condition. in all three cases, the necessary control signal is found to be extremely large, indicating that the network is practically uncontrollable in most cases, even with optimal control. to solve the paradox, we propose a systematic and analytically driven control strategy that dramatically reduces the needed energy. we conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of this control strategy by demonstrating applications to a variety of real - world networks, including the string and circuit networks.
we present a new solid - state alternative to the photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) as a measurement device for positron emission tomography. the proposed design has a high spatial resolution ( 3 mm @xmath0 3 mm in area ), achieves an accuracy of 80 %, has a very high fill factor ( 80 % ), and is very sensitive. the design features two - dimensional arrays of geiger avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) that synchronize the logical signals generated by the pixel with a global clock across the chip to ensure uniform arrival of signals to the tdc digitizers. because of this design, the temporal resolution of the sensor is severely compromised by the large amount of support circuitry between adjacent pixels, resulting in an extremely low temporal resolution ( @xcite ) and a limited spatial resolution. however, the sensor does achieve a high temporal resolution. in this paper, we describe a method to combine a geiger apd detector with a high - performance time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) that records a time stamp in a memory buffer whenever a signal is detected on its input. this allows us to track continuous time variations of a single photon flux across a large, continuous region of the detector. in addition, the architecture we propose allows for efficient, high - density, and high - gain detection of positron fluxes. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 p. pringsheim, ` ` accepted for publication in optics express, '' philosophical transactions of the royal society a : mathematical, physical sciences, and engineering sciences * a. a. the enrico fermi award, d.c., italy, # 1 ( # 2 ) # 3. m. atature, r. baringer, c. alexander, j. beugnon, p. bernet, and d. badolato, _ introduction to quantum optics _ ( springer, 2010 ), vol. 131 of _ proceedings of the ieee international conference on particle and nuclear physics _, pp. 175 - 179 ( nato, greenbelt, md, usa. _, http://www.ieee.org/doi/10.1016/j.cpc.2010.10.00619[comp.. comm. physics, 2012 ], paper sm3g1a.s.
we study in detail the implications of the neutrino oscillation solutions of the solar and atmospheric problems and of the results of the reactor long baseline chooz and palo verde experiments, for the predictions of the effective majorana mass parameter, which controls the -decay rate. we address the general case of cp - nonconservation and we obtain predictions for the values of the relative cp - parities of the three massive majorana neutrinos : the lma msw, the sma msw and the low - qvo one. in each of these cases we identify the ` ` just - cp - violation '' region of values of whenever it existed : a value of in this region would unambiguously signal the presence of chr - violation in the lepton sector. analyzing the case of clumping, we derive predictions for corresponding to all possible sets of values and we give the corresponding non - trivial lower bounds on. we find that a sufficiently accurate measurement of, @xmath0, can allow to get direct information on the value of the cp - violating phase. in particular, a measurement of the -dependence of with a rate comparable to that of the super - kamiokande experiment can lead to a unique determination of, i.e., to a substantial reduction of the signal - to - noise of the future high - sensitivity experiments. cern - ph - th/2005 - 241 + tum -t39 - 03 - ove + mpp-2005 - 156 + hep - ph/0512032 * andrzej j. buras,@xmath1 physik - department, technische universitt mnchen, d-85747 garching, germany pacs numbers : 14.60.jh, 12.38.bx, 14.80.cp @=11 -11 - reprinted figurations, provided with the permission of the authors, are as follows. the first four figures are shown in postscript form, which may be viewed as a black box. the last two images are of the final result, displayed in black - space, shown in red - light and shown in blue - shadowed form. + + + 1.5 cm i.z. uren, peter l. andreani, + _ and _ instituto de fsica, depto. fsica terica, + c.f., universidad andres bello, av. lisboa, chile _ + 2.5
we study the evolution of perturbations during transition periods in the early universe when the effective equation of state changes. in our scenario, inflation is driven by mssm flat directions, which are classified by the _ gauge - invariant _ combination of scalar fields in the theory. if successful inflation is compatible with the allowed regions of the parameter space which yield the correct abundance of neutralino dark matter, it can have a renormalizable coupling to the sm higgs, but for an absolute gauge singlet the strength of such a coupling is not constrained by any symmetry argument. then the universe will evolve as in a matter dominated epoch for @xmath0. during this intermediate epoch, modes which exit the horizon during the first phase of inflation will freeze, but can be re - entered on the later side of the horizon, which results in detectable gravity waves. we find that the tensor modes are stretched during inflation, resulting in a constant scalar curvature perturbation at superhubble scales. on the other hand, if the horizon of assisted inflation is large, a singularity is expected due to the injection of matter of varying mass. # 1 # 2 # 3 mod. phys. lett. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3)#1#2 # 3 # 1#1| # 2| # 3 = cmss10 scaled 1 = cmr10 scaled1 = cmbx9 at 12.38.aw, qm069@xmath1, mqm10 at 10.14.ml, sb60 at 8.39.mg, ftp10 at 5.9pt, rr10 at 2.4pt, k3 at 4.2pt, msw10 at 7.8pt, xulong at 3.6pt, gianluca geloni, v. giorgini, m. martin, + a. bianchi 46, i-20133 cracow, poland e - mail : martin@phys.iog.ac.cn, giovanni.pettinelli@instein.edu.pl it is well known that there are interesting ` ` hidden '' sources of non - perturbative gravity waves that originate from the very early universe. these are gravitational waves which propagate in different directions from the spherically symmetric initial conditions set by the standard model ( sm ) @xcite and are weakly interacting, i.e. do not make a contribution to the soft
we obtain explicit results for the behavior of the superconducting state of a quasi one - dimensional one dimensional ( 1d ) bcs superconductor in the limit where there is no interchain coupling. we discuss a number of critical phenomena, which are related to the nature of the order parameter in the 1d limit, such as the emergence of superconductivity in the region of parameter space where the normal state is a non - fermi liquid. in particular, we find that the critical point can be regarded as a quantum critical point, where the strength of the josephson coupling at long wavelengths becomes asymptotically equal to the quantum critical mass. consequently, the critical end point of the spectrum exhibits a pronounced peak - dip shoulder, as well as a broad coherent peak above the threshold. we argue that this feature is a consequence of the fact that the distance from the coherent peak to the dip shoulder is proportional to @xmath0 and hence, at high temperature, the multi - particle excitations in the state become quasiparticles. in contrast, at low temperature and/or in the multiparticle regime, the single hole spectral function is entirely dominated by thermal fluctuations, and below the threshold temperature can be described by a single excitation - dominated model with a single coherence scale. we provide detailed analytical expressions for the spectral functions, and we show that, in the presence of a preexisting spin gap, the spectrum will exhibit features akin to those seen in bilinear and quartic superconductors. these include : ( i ) a sharp, momentum- dependent resonant mode in the spectrum ; ( ii ) a spectrum in which is dominated by single spin fluctuations at low energies and long wavelengths ; ( iii ) a variety of nonanalytic behavior due to the three soliton threshold ; and ( iv ) various forms of temperature dependence for the single spin level, including nonmonotonic behavior near the soliton - antisoliton transition. in a subsequent paper, we will discuss the generalization of these results to subcritical underdoped and optimally doped systems. = 10000
in the standard adiabatic cold - dark matter - based models of structure formation, the number of spatial regions @xmath0 for which the universe is spatially flat depends on a very small number of physical parameters. though the detailed outcome in any one locality, and what complex systems evolve there depends on local accidents, these parameters nonetheless determine the statistical properties. will it ever be possible to compute the values of all these parameters from first principles, within the framework of some yet to be discovered fundamental theory? some physical parameters may take a range of different values throughout this ensemble of exponentially large and causally disconnected regions. on the purpose of this paper is to consider such selection effects, by studying how the effects of lowering and raising @xfig3, the cosmological constant. our motivation for this is threefold : 1. it affects which inflation / defect models are considered natural as opposed to fine tuned. 2. it is related to a crucial loophole in the recent arguments for an anthropic upper bound on the degree of nonlinearity of the vacuum density. 3. it poses useful test problems for studying defect models, especially if the potentials are super - flat, i.e. have a mass - to - light ratio several times larger than the planck value. 4. it may well be natural to expect low surface brightness galaxies to be underrepresented in many surveys, e.g. the virial temperature of our own hubble volume.5. finally, we take a novel approach to the problem of determining the physical parameters of a flat universe by including the anthropic selection effects. these are taking into account the fact that observers are not equally situated in all parts of the ensemble, and are thereby able to present their results in a form that is consistent with other observational data. in particular, we find that if the primordial density of the universe were twice the present value, then galaxies would be overrepresented in the set of regions that contain observers. the implications of this result for cosmology are discussed. cosmology : theory, dark matter, galaxies : structure
in this work, we identify influential transcription factors ( tfs ) across cancer conditions by analysing large - scale protein - interaction ( ppi ) and gene - expression datasets. pdac tumours constitute 93 - 95 % of all breast tumours, while familial tumours comprise 5 - 7 %, although studies have noted that brca1 tumours are more hetergeneous and may be her2-enriched. the contribution of this work is to relate changes in co - expression of complexes to changes in their transcriptional regulation between cancer conditions. through a _ log - linear _ model, we investigate the functional activities of several complexes that are implicated in both pancreatic tumours and normal and ductal adenocarcinoma tumours. complex nf@xmath0b1/rel family genes, which play important roles in programmed cell death and proliferation control, and tfs regulating these complexes, were identified from the ppi data. on the other hand, tfs regulated by the pancreas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) family were not found to be present in complexes associated with either normal or brca2 tumour conditions. we also looked for changes in regulation of certain complexes that showed significant differences in expression compared to their parent complexes. we developed a computational model to use tfs regulation to identify influential tfs and complexes and validate their roles in cancer. two case studies, normal @xmath3-congressional cancer _ vs _ the pancreatic cancer tumour and a case study of a familial breast tumour showing prominent tfs, were studied. normal tumours showed considerable changes in tfs ; particularly important tfs showed a decrease in expression of the three strongest genes, while saw little change in activity of the other genes. compared to a simple parametric analysis, we noticed a considerable change in the regulation of the tfs among the five complexes. these observations suggest the activation of dna double - strand break ( dsb ) and mismatch - induced mrna repair ( mmr ) pathways. tumour tfs may play a crucial role in compensating for the loss of dsb - repair machinery through the sister chromatid exchange following dna damage via ionizing radiation.

we use the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to study the topology of large - scale structure and its dependence on galaxy luminosity, color, and morphology. a volume - limited sample ( best defined by @xmath0 ) is used to measure the genus versus power spectrum relation at a range of smoothing scales by incorporating the galaxies from the sdss main catalog and the results of large n - body simulations. we confirm that the added galaxies are mostly located in high surface density regions. in particular, a large number of galaxies are added in the virgo cluster region and near the equator. next, we recalculate the angular selection function of the kias vagc within each spherical polygon formed by the adaptive tiling algorithm ( blanton et al. ), and we trim some regions with narrow angular extent. even though early - type galaxies show topology similar to that of red ( blue ) galaxies, morphology - dependence of topology is not identical with color. we find large differences in topology for blue and red galaxies, which can be attributed to failures of the galaxy formation model rather than non - gaussian initial conditions. we test five galaxy formation models, including a semi - analytic model that assigns galaxies to halos with parameters tuned to match clustering statistics, and five sets of mock galaxies with 6.0@xmath1 mpc smoothing. none of them reproduces all aspects of the observed topology, though the differences from one model to another are comparable to the discrepancies with the observations. for the best sample, which consists of the galaxies with the largest absolute magnitudes ( i.e., red with positive genus ), we find that the predicted topology depends on galaxy morphology more strongly than color. compared to the predictions based on analytic calculations, our measurements are consistent with the deviations from the gaussian prediction. the deviations are caused by the peculiar velocity distortions in redshift space rather than sample geometry or boundary effects. in future work, we will use our measurements on the genus to probe the physics of primordial fluctuations in the distant universe.
the circulation of an electrical pulse around a ring - shaped piece of atrial cardiac tissue from a tortoise heart is investigated as a model for reentrant activity. the pulse is found to undergo a bifurcation to a stable rest state which is subsequently terminated by a central symmetry breaking event. the behaviour of the wave train is studied using a normal form for a single pulse on a periodic domain which takes the form of a delay differential equation for travelling waves in one - dimensional excitable media. the normal form describes stationary states in parameter space where the system is close to the saddle - node of the pulse. in particular it exhibits a hopf bifuristiccating solution for a wave train which is not supercritical. we derive the corresponding central solution branch in the case of a nonlinear partial differential equation and use this to determine the stability of this solution. it is shown that our analysis coincides with the well - known restitution condition for cardiac alternans, i.e. solenoidal oscillations of a pseudo - continuum of modes which are believed to be the mechanism for the spiral wave breakup. we corroborate our result by means of numerical simulations where oscillations are indeed stable. the main implication of our analysis is that cardiac oscillations close to criticality may be supercritical resulting in sustained stable oscillations or subcritical leading to a collapse of the oscillations. * according to the standard theory of cardiac dynamics travelling waves are responsible for the pathological cardiac arrhythmias, if the cardiac relaxation is sub - critical the wave breaks up into a series of spiral waves. on the other hand, there are many instances in which subcritical behaviour is observed for a particular class of relaxation. thus it is of great interest to understand whether or not it is possible to observe subcritical oscillations in generic cardiac dynamics. to this aim we derive a common type of stable solution branch for a pulse in a one - dimension excitable medium and apply it to study the dynamics of cardiac excitation and its instability. *
we use non - lte wind models to study the influence of the extreme ultraviolet radiation ( xuv ) on the ionization structure of cool supergiant and main - sequence hot stars. the xuv radiation is parameterized in a convenient way by the square of the wind mass - loss rate, @xmath0, and we apply the model parameters derived from statistical equilibrium ( nlte ) hydrodynamics. the chemical composition of the considered elements is assumed to be solar, while the temperature is fixed based on the tlusty grid of the ionic equation of state. the line radiative force is calculated directly from the model equations by summing the contribution from individual transitions, i.e., cak line force. we assume spherically symmetric and constant ionization laws for the wind. the effect of the recombination radiation is estimated from the inner slope of the [ ] line at 54.4ev / 124ev, and the cmf line force is used as the ` ` central '' line force in the case of a homogeneous and stationary wind. we compare our results with those obtained from observations assuming solar chemical composition in the solar atmosphere. for the stellar luminosities derived from previous work it is generally agreement. on the other hand, the predictions for h@xmath1 diagnostics [ ] and [ ] are lower than the observed values, implying a more significant level of clumping or aversions in the winds for giants. however, the overall properties such as line profiles, velocity, and ionization fraction do not change significantly. our model predictions do not completely rule out the possibility of a modest amount of dust clumping, however. the strengthening of x - ray lines or the weakness of infrared continua may be a sufficient condition to require a lower mass loss rate than observed ones.

the influence of non - thermal tails in the electron distribution on the comptonized synchrotron emission from plasmas of parameters typical for accreting black holes is investigated. in models of advection - dominated accretion flows, the cs process appears to be the main radiative process in the innermost part of the accretion flow, where most of the available gravitational energy is liberated. as a result, even a weak non - statistical component far beyond the thermal peak can greatly enhance the synchrotronic emission. this emission provides seed photons for comptonization, which also correspondingly enhances the luminosity of the composite spectrum. however, the shape of the comptization spectrum remains only weakly modified, with the main signature being a relatively weak high - energy tail. we show that this effect becomes stronger with the decreasing plasma temperature and increasing optical depth, which typically correspond to an increasing eddington ratio. it is also much stronger in the case of agns than in the cases of stellar black holes, as a consequence of weaker magnetic field in the former objects. the cs luminosity can be amplified by a factor @xmath0 g in agns and by @xcite g in black - hole binaries, respectively. thus, accreted black holes are expected to emit more luminous soft x - rays than single black holes without a surrounding accretion disc. we also derive upper limits on the magnetic field strength in a broad range of parameters relevant for black hole sources. the upper limits are consistent with the model of a two - temperature plasma with a maxwellian steady - state distribution, as predicted by ghisellini, guilbert & svensson ( 1999 ). other physical mechanisms ( e.g. acceleration by whistlers ) can not be ruled out, as well as the presence of magnetic fields of the order of that corresponding to equipartition with gas pressure.

we present new calculations of interstellar dust particle trajectories and densities in the heliosphere based on a combination of observed and modeled fluxes of interstellar photons from the voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. the calculations are carried out using a self - consistent model of interstellar magnetic fields ( ismf ) that includes the effects of radiation pressure from the sun, solar wind magnetic field, lorentz force from the solar plasma, and gravitational gravity from the particles. the model is in the mhd - kinetic approximation, with the plasma density and temperatures determined self - consistently from measured plasma conditions and the radiation field modeled by the sun. the interstellar and solar fluxes have equal effect on charging grains at @xmath0 au. the calculated charges and trajectories for spherical grains are compared to recent observations by voyager 2. we find that the grains are accelerated by the interstellar magnetic field and thus have an initial velocity greater than the gas turbulent velocity observed for the local interstellar cloud. additional grain charging occurs in the hot subsonic solar wind plasma in the inner heliosheath between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause because of secondary electron emission produced by collisions of high energy electrons with the grains. taking guidance from the recent trajectory calculations of wu et al., we give the grains a 3 speed ( relative to the gas torusional velocity ) for initial charges calculated assuming a solar turbulent velocity and a net direction that is perpendicular to the magnetic field. total 3-d trajectories are calculated for grains starting in a grid that includes grains with sizes starting in the far - from - the - sun ecliptic plane, located at 10 au, and having densities that are 10 - 20 % below the cosmic value for a spherical grain. the trajectories calculated using the model and grain - charging code of gould & mathis ( 1995 ) are consistent with observations of the 3.6 ev cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and interstellar h@xmath1 emission from small grains near the solar orbit. however, the observed h - he offset is larger than the predicted mrn power law offset of 1.9, suggesting that small grains are significantly depleted in the inflowing interstellar medium.
we study out of equilibrium thermal field theories with switching on the interaction at finite time, and with applications to heavy - ion collisions. we develop a calculation scheme based on first principles for the space of projected functions ( i.e., bare propagators, one - loop self - energies, resummed schwinger - dyson series ). we find that many functions are of this type in the @xmath0 limit and that they satisfy important analyticity assumptions : ( 1 ) the function of poles is analytic above the real axis ( for a retarded component ), but below it for an advanced component ; ( 2 ) the convolution product is a simple multiplication of the two - point functions, ( 3 ) the energy denominator is an wigner transform, and ( 4 ) the product of two point functions satisfies the " finite time keldysh integration path. under these assumptions, we are able to calculate the dependence of some observables on the relative time of the interaction, e.g., the absolute switching - on time. we also find that some quantities, obtained at low orders of the perturbative expansion, are in fact positively related to the determinations obtained starting at earlier times. for example, the recursion index of the retarded propagator at zero energy is analytically described by the recurrence relation, and the energy - smearing factor is shown to be an increasing function of time for the retarded component. in the second part of the paper, we deal with the problem of the application of our approach to the light - bending perturbation theory. for this problem, we direct the attention to the specific case of retarded propagators. we show that the discontinuous cut - off of the energy spectrum at nonzero energy is accompanied by a sharp cutoff in the analytic property of the propagator. under this assumption, the cuts of the analytic structure are expected to be abrupt and do not correspond to the cuts in the dispersion function. by using the connection between the cutoff at nonlinear time and the self - energy obtained by smearing, we find an interesting technical implication of the generalization of feynman rules.
we address the unification of gauge couplings of the standard model ( sm ) in the one - step breaking scenario of the non - susy gauge theory by exploiting the intrinsic matter parity of so(10 ) leading to triplet fermion in @xmath0 as dark matter candidate. to achieve this, we address three outstanding problems : neutrino masses, dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of the universe. the proton lifetime prediction is predicted in this model at two - loop level of gauge coupling unification. the model classifies non - standard fermionic ( scalar or vector ) or scalar representations of not supersymmetric ( nonsupersymmetric ) guts carrying even or odd matter parity containing suitable components of dark matter. successful ansatz for baryogenesis via leptogenesis is shown to emerge for each pattern of neut@xmath2 masses. we infer on the masses of the left - handed scalar triplet and rh neutrinos necessary forleptogenesis through the hybrid seesaw formula, that converts the dynamically generated leptonic cp- asymmetry in decays of both rh@xmaisons to bjorken - higgsino mediated proton decay. this model also offers an interesting new possibility for the solution of the gauge hierarchy problem in favor of fine - tuning to every loop order selected from the superheavy components of various representations. psfig.tex # 1#2#3mod. phys. lett. a * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 1 = cmssbx10 scaled 2 = cmr10 scaled1 = cmti10 scaled 1 = cmbx9 scaled 2 -0.5truecm # 1*#1 * # 2 * # 3 ( # 1 ) # 4 desy 09 - 009 issn 0418 - 9833 + july 2009 + * tripletfermion dm and dark matter in non - suy su(5 ) gut * * what are the minimal gauge theories? * + * w. l. frigerio and l. hambye * + department of physics, university of california, los angeles, ca 95616 - 8677, usa + e - mail : friglio@univ-saclay.edu.cn, h.j.frerrari@cs.ucl.ac.uk + * msc - classes : * 11 # 1re#1im#1 # 1tr#1
we present a simple method to analyze the conductance of periodic molecular chains attached to metallic electrodes. the method is based on an analytical expression for the green s function of the device and is in general equivalent to the classical expression @xmath0=@xmath1. it is shown that, under the assumption of a self - consistent kohn - sham hamiltonian of the chain, the resulting expression is equivalent to setting the dynamical part of the potential to zero. from this expression, the tunneling conductance is derived via simple analytical expressions for the ground state energy and the current density. we demonstrate applications to periodic phenyl chains and to alkyl chains with amine groups. the potential drop of an au atom attached to one of the two ends of a molecular chain is shown to be zero when the au core separation is large enough. finally, we propose devices where the potential of the au atoms at the fermi level can be reduced by removing the potential from the surfaces. one limiting factor of molecular electronic devices is the potential - energy dispersion due to coulomb interactions. this potential drop gives rise to an energy that is larger than the resistivity of the molecule, consequently resulting in a potential drop that is much larger than that of the constituent electrons. the effect of varying the distance between leads and molecular atoms has been considered in the context of many - body physics, and has been partially investigated in refs. a. this work focuses on applications to molecular circuits based on the method presented in ref.. it was pointed out that, even in the strictly one dimensional case, the riemann surface of the atomic bands still exhibits a slightly non - trivial shape that can be used to calculate the contact conductance. ref. discussed briefly the general case of two metal - poor molecular chains, and presented a number of testable theoretical schemes that could possibly lead to the design of electronic devices based on this method. in the following, we present the method in detail and demonstrate its practical application.
we construct a rest - frame near - infrared ( nir ) morphological catalog of galaxies at @xmath0(ab ) = 0.81.2 from the deep nir imaging survey ( mods ; k09 ) data in a part of the goods - n field, and locate luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) in that field. we estimate the stellar masses ( @xfig.sty ) and reddening corrected for the effects of agn and star - burst phenomena from a parametric analysis using the multicolor imaging assembly ( mpi ) catalog of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). we constructed a two - dimensional light profile using the two - point light profile and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) f160w and f814w photometric redshifts from the catalog of kurucz et al. ( 2012 ), and fit a gaussian model with a single - component stellar mass distribution function ( mdf ) to describe the galaxy morphology. based on the simulations with artificial galaxies, we find that the morphological analysis using galfit applied to the mods data is a reliable method to identify lirg and agn candidates in the catalog. we take advantage of the fact that the ratio of the semimajor to semiminor axial radius, the position angle, and the neutron star to black hole mass density ratio are measured as free parameters using the virial theorem and the mass - to - light ratio(@xmath1 ) and the _ chandra _ x - ray background radiation field indicator, to design the spectroscopic redshift distribution function. as a next step, we cross - correlate the galaxy catalog with the _ spitzer_/mips mid - ir catalog to examine the distribution of star - forming regions in the massive disk - like galaxies in the survey. we find a significant fraction of the agn - selected galaxies ( 29 out of 112 ) are located near bright 24 @xday m - band sources, and two of them have pah - like ir luminosities, @xcite. those galaxies are different from the local disk galaxies in morphology, and star formation activity seems to be smoothly distributed in their disk. in addition, our results indicate that the very active and recent star formation is occurred primarily in the outer regions of the disks in massive galaxies.

we investigate the dynamical evolution of the delocalized state of a two - level - emitter quantum well array coupled to radiation fields. as the array contains a large number of emitters, the rabi - like oscillations induced in the collective excitation of the array can be described in a quantum way by an effective superposition of a single excitation across all @xmath0 quantum wells. to show that this effect can be realized in a solid - state environment, we consider in detail how to use a multiple - quantum - well structure as the two - photon emitter. we also apply the original leggett - garg inequality, and a markovian variation of it, to examine the quantum coherence of the system. 99 n. j. cerf, g. leuchs, and e. s. polzik, ` ` on the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox, '' physics * 1 *, 195 - 200 ( 1964 ). d. m. greenberger, m.a. horne, a. shimony, i.v. kabakova, c. kurtsiefer, s. bach, p. h. kompa, and h. p. jensen, _ quantum computation and quantum physics _ ( cambridge university press, cambridge, 2011 ). p. g. kwiat, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, paul dirac, and j. vukovi'c, ` ` violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality in a photonic cavity - quantum electrodynamics experiment, '' phys. rev. lett. * 58 *, 1593 - 1597 ( 1985 ). a. zeilinger, p - j.- s. b. c. bennett, and w. k. wootters, _ optical quantum optics _ ( springer verlag, heidelberg new york tokyo, chiba, japan, _ collaboration between niu, italy, and carnegie mellon national laboratory, department of physics, university of california, davis, ca 95616, usa ; + e - mail : njcerf@anu.edu pure quantum information can be stored in optical cavities with the ability to store and manipulate light. recently it has been experimentally demonstrated that a quantum well surrounded by a quantum dot can behave as a cavity without a mirror and exhibit quantum rabi
the monte carlo method is a well - established and popular approach to solve non - equilibrium statistical mechanics problems. here we describe a variant of this approach where the random numbers that determine the value of an oracle function are the same for every point in configuration space and the probability to sample a given point in that configuration space is expressed, in a probabilistic sense, by the average of the stochastic estimator of that quantity. we then construct an approximate algorithm for such cases which, if the fluctuations are normally distributed, becomes exact in practice. as an application, we show how it can be used to determine the volume of the basin of attraction of a given energy minimum @xmath0 in a high - dimensional energy landscape, which is necessary for fast equilibration of mcmc random walks performed inside the basin. the approach is not restricted to quantum states, although it is always valid for problems that can be sampled with moderate frequency, and which are normally treated as deterministic but non - deterministic fluctuations. we illustrate its use by means of a sampling example, where we consider the ` old'( boltzmann weight ) and ` new'( rosenbluth weight ) points that are selected randomly from a graph of symmetric states. in both the old and new cases, the parameters that drive the evolution of the weights are determined in a deterministic manner so that the outcome of sampling is independent of the initial conditions. finally, we discuss how the approach can be employed in the case of random walks that are performed not with respect to equilibrium, i.e. where there are many ( possibly noisy ) states that are not sampled with high frequency. the analysis of large deviations from equilibrium is often referred to as ` cloud'sampling. in this context, it is well known that many minimisation problems ( e.g. the problem of finding the biologically most efficient minimisation strategies based on microscopic equilibrium states ) can be solved exactly @xcite. yet, there are other interesting situations where sampling may not be the best choice. for different reasons ranging from obvious errors to more pernicious effects, the large uncertainties in the determination of the equilibrium state mean that large energy barriers can be put in place in order to maximise an error budget or to minimize the number of errors in the experiment, for instance, the acceptance of a random move, as might be required to minimise a number of moves. monte - carlo ( mc ) methods have become favoured overministic methods due to their ease
we present a systematic analysis of the star formation properties of galaxies in the infall regions of local clusters, based on a catalogue of @xmath0-band images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). this is the first mass - selected sample of clusters in the local universe that have been observed to contain significant numbers of galaxies with star formation rates ( sfrs ) above the eddington limit. we find that star formation ( sfr ) and specific star formation rate ( ) of cluster galaxies are enhanced in regions close to the cores of rich clusters, such as those around the centres of virgo and abell 2744. we show that such an enhancement is a direct consequence of the way local ( galaxy and relative velocity ) conditions are affected by the global layout of the cosmic web. it is also in sync with the results of a study by @xcite showing that in the cold dark matter universe, more massive structures are more strongly clustered than their less massive counterparts. our data show that infalling starburst galaxies are predominantly of type i ( spiral ), and their distribution is indistinguishable from that of the unclassified population of star forming galaxies, which is well - known to follow a star formation sequence. the fraction of starburst " galaxies at a given cluster centric distance is almost twice that at the core of clusters. infalling galaxies often show evidence of comet - like tails of x - ray emitting gas, and a shock front, suggesting that, as we reveal in this paper, some of these galaxies are plunging into the cluster core on their own. while such galaxies are a common phenomenon in clusters, they are relatively rare in our local sample. the frequency and impact of such galaxy - galaxy interactions are found to depend upon the local galaxy density. our results suggest that galaxy groups and clusters are being assembled predominantly through the merger of galaxies falling in through straight filaments, in analogy to the ` butcher - oemler effect ', whereby a starburst galaxy is stripped of its gas content by the intracluster medium of a massive group or cluster. this effect is in agreement with recent suggestions that the icm may be part of the large - scale structure in the universe.

we investigate the origin of the recently discovered halo star sdss j102915 + 172927, which has [ fe / h]@xmath0 and a chemical pattern indicative of a classical extremely metal - poor star, based on detailed pre - supernova and supernova explosion models. we identify a set of plausible progenitor models which may account for the enrichment of its birth cloud by population iii ( pop iii ) massive energetic hypernovae. the models are based on the nucleation and accretion of dust grains by means of a semi - analytical model for core - collapse and reverse - shock nucleosynthesis. the physical conditions prevailing in star forming regions at high - redshift are reconstructed from the output of supernova simulation models to compute the amount of dust produced by the ejecta and its partial destruction by the associated reverse shock. we then study the fragmentation and properties of a star forming cloud enriched by the products of these explosions and identify the conditions that enable the formation of sub - solar mass stars. assuming grain growth by accretion in a self - similar seed cluster driven by the combined effects of the ejection of dust and water, we show that the observed elemental abundance pattern can be well reproduced for a population iii supernova with @xmath1 progenitors. the inclusion of a carbon - enhanced star as a key ingredient in the analysis leads us to identify the fraction of carbon - rich stars in the light element budget in the milky way halo as a function of metallicity. for the particular model that we use, the carbon - to - gas ratio is much higher, by about an order of magnitude, than that observed for the more metal - rich halo stars he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326. however, in the overall picture that we present here, in which a significant fraction of the iron is in the star, it is necessary that some other elements ( besides carbon ) be formed as a precursor to the dust grains. we stress, however, that our results do not include the effect of efficient mass loss on the yields of the light elements.

frustrated magnets can host non - collinear magnetic states that are stabilized by the relativistic dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction. in addition to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, there are also exchange interactions among spins. the dm interaction imprints these states into a pattern of edge channels, which guide the motion of skyrmions. using numerical simulations, we show that the edge channels formed at the edges of frustrated magnets give rise to a new class of states, which are topologically protected against extinction by periodic modulation of their spin structures. we find that these edge states are qualitatively different from those in bulk magnets : under an applied electric current they emit topological charges that are fully conserved from bulk magnetization. the topological charge of the edge state is proportional to @xmath0 for large enough currents, and decreases with increasing current along the direction of the stripe edges. we also find that the interface between the stripe and the lattice is a new vorticity regime, which is regulated by the winding number of magnetic nanostructures. the fractional quantum number of topological defects increases with increasing electric current, which leads to the appearance of multiple edge channels continuously running along the stripe. the simultaneous presence of these different edge states can lead to new physics, which can be utilized for information processing. our results suggest a novel way of storing information in frustrated magnet structures and novel routes for the storage and processing of information. * frustration in magnetic systems is known to be strong, because it leads to topological superconductivity in the bulk and a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) effect in the condensed matter world @xcite. the sdw effect is best understood in the context of 1d mott insulators ( mott - sis ), where the spin lattice topology gives rise to alternating symmetries and spin - orbit locking. it is analogous to the magnetic - field induced instability of itinerant magnets where chains of magnetic ions create superconducting edge states parallel to the bulk. in chiral magnets the opposite effect is observed : the period of spin - rotation in spirals and in - plane spins winding around the edge of a magnet are closely spaced, leading to chiral symmetry and helical motion of the spins. recently, it was shown that a new material class of magnetic structures, called frustrated magnets, can be grafted onto the bulk of a triangular lattice and support a class of non -
we present the results of spectral and light curve modelling of the type ib / c supernova ( snib / c ) sn2010ah, a bright, broad - lined snic without a gamma - ray burst ( grb ). we combine our modelling with radiation transport models and spectroscopy to construct a bolometric light curve for the supernova and derive the properties of the light curve and spectra for this type of supernova. we use this light curve to estimate the mass of @xmath0ni and estimate the kinetic energy of the ejecta assuming a single star progenitor. the results are compared to those of other well - studied hypernovae, high - luminosity supernovae ( sne ) like sn2002ap and 2005e, which have properties straddling those of grb- and non - grb / sne. the slow rise of the synthetic light curve is likely to be the result of insufficient mixing - out of neutral atoms and of a dense low - velocity core, possibly a signature of an aspherical explosion. the high - energy transient in the outer layers is not detectable in the data. we also present a new set of high - resolution spectra, which show very well - defined broad emission lines and a relatively fast decline. from these features we derive the age of the explosion ( assuming a constant temperature and type of stellar evolution ) and the most probable ejecta mass ( assuming @xcite ). after applying a shock model to the spectra we find a value for the temperature of the core ( t=31,000 k, t@xmath2=6,300 k ), a value that agrees with the time of explosion, but is not at all consistent with the value of 7,500 k proposed in the earlier spectrum of sn1998bw. finally, the lack of an associated x - ray or radio counterpart is possibly ruled out for the same reason. based on the best - fit parameters we derive a lower limit on the ejecting mass of m6v, which is one of the most important parameters.

we investigate the cross - correlation between the dark matter distribution and the secondary cmb temperature fluctuations induced by the ionized medium in the mildly nonlinear universe under the scenario of adiabatic cold dark matter ( cdm ) for structure formation. we first develop a formalism for calculating the cross correlation function and its angular power spectrum between the weak lensing field produced by the weak gravitational instability in the cosmological expansion of the universe and including the doppler effects up to the second - order of the bulk velocity field. we apply the small angle approximation based on the bond & efstathiou ( 1987 ) small angle formalism to the eft equation and take into account the sinusoidal distortion effects on the cmb map developed by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1999 ). we find that the dominant contribution to the cross correlations in the @xmath0 function arises from the dominant density - modulated density - primordial zeroth order perturbation, while the negative covariances due to the central dominant density fluctuations account for only the secondary fluctuations. under the currently favored assumption of homogeneous reionization history for the structure formation, the values of the angular power spectra in the cdm models are expected to be comparable with the present - day values, if the redshifts of individual clusters of galaxies can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy. then, with further data with arcminute - scale spatial resolution and sensitivity, we may be able to make a significant measurement of the redshift dependence of the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations on the background of the ionizing sources such as qsos and high mass stars. this would provide us with an important clue to reionize the universe assuming a general inhomogeneous distribution of dark matter. we further find that in the current data with the current sensitivity and resolution of the planck surveyor and high resolution n - body simulation of the projected dark matter field, the effect of the lensing distortion should be negligible. in view of this, we suggest the solution of the outstanding problem of the relation between the mass density profile of stars and the mass fluctuations in the universe, which has been referred to as the sz effect, in the framework of the phase - space distribution of the reionized epoch.

the first data release of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory catalog ( csc ) is presented. the csc was compiled from a first year of pointed observations obtained using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) instrument, and comprises 135,914 individual source detections, corresponding to a total of 94,676 distinct sources on the sky. the catalog is designed to be a general purpose virtual science facility, and provides simple access to a carefully selected set of generally useful quantities for individual sources or sets of sources matching user - specified search criteria. we present the design of the catalog, the data processing procedures used to process the data, and the algorithms used to extract the individual source properties from the catalog. we also describe in detail the method used to match source detection from multiple overlapping observations, and discuss the mathematical derivation of the multivariate optimal weighting formalism used for combining source position and positional uncertainty estimates from multiple observations. 0.178 in 0.0 in 8.25 in d. cronin, _ xmm - newton _, # 2, # 3. r. w. boyd, _ astronomy department, university of california, berkeley, ca 94720, usa. d. m. hudson, r. s. manes, and d. b. thompson, _ high energy astronomy from x - rays to the ground _, vol. 2, eolsz, ed.

we present a study of the fireshell model for gamma ray bursts ( grbs ), focusing on the comparison of its predictions with the observed prompt emission spectra and light curves and spectra of highly energetic sources. we focus on two sources for which a satisfactory agreement between the theoretical predictions and the observed data have been obtained so far : grb 080319b ( @xmath0 erg ; swift _ swift _ bat data ) and grb050904 ( @xcite ). we derive analytic expressions for the intrinsic parameters of the multiband light curve and spectrum of each source, as well as for the temporal behavior of its power - law index and variability, which are then compared with the observational data. we find that the inclusion of a phenomenological parameter, which characterizes the departure of the low energy part of the comoving spectrum from a pure thermal one, makes the observed grb spectra qualitatively different from a thermal one. in particular, the spectral energy distribution of the lower energetic sources is characterized by a photon index that is slightly enhanced around the peak energy, while the high energy ones are consistent with a constant value. this is the case for all grbs for which the thermal spectrum is too low to be consistent with the data, so that the ` ` modified '' thermal spectrum we present here is a suitable substitute for the pure thermal spectrum. we compare the results obtained from such phenomenological methods with the ones obtained from the theoretical models, using the ansatz developed by enrico fermi for the grb prompt emission studies, aimed at explaining the observations, with a numerical simulations. the numerical simulations, performed with a statistical code named cherenkov - fock, allows us to follow the evolution of a grb through the entire ` ` fireball '', starting from the initial process of gravitational collapse to a black hole through all successive stages, and to analyze, in detail, the resulting resulting grb variability. we conclude that the rapid and extended afterglow that is observed in high energy grbs is a ` ` clumpy '' cosmic ray burst, composed of ` ` spikes '' of various sizes and epochs, and must be produced by the inhomogeneities of the matter associated with the burst. in this sense, it is similar to the case of galactic halo plasmas.

we report here the x - ray properties of the full ( for radio detection ) sample of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) detected in 47 tuc by chandra. this is the first determination of these properties for a significant sample of msps at a common known distance. we derive @xmath0 msp total counts, spindown energy loss, characteristic age, and radio beaming factor ( 0.20.5 ) for this large, rich globular. we also compare our results to those of the single msp detected in ngc 6397 by ghe01b and previous ( rosat ) results for msps in the field and one globular ( m28 ), and find that the msp radial distribution is consistent with the predictions of a multi - mass king model, allowing for the exchange of a neutron star ( nss ) with its replacement main sequence ( msp ) star, if present. the two - body tidal capture ( -c ) mechanism appears to be the most likely mechanism for the production of the many millimeter sources in clusters, although multi - body schemes also may be at work in many globulars. using the chandra absolute positions, we place limits on the positions of the individual msps. based on these limits, we suggest that a much larger fraction ( up to 60 % ) of the msps may have been detected in x - rays than detected in the radio, given the tendency for bb - plus - pl ( bp ) emission to persist longer than non - bb emission, or a combination of both of the bp and pl mechanisms. the faint thermal msps with correspondingly higher x -ray temperatures are more likely to be related to the non - thermal or bremsstrahlung emission in the cluster, suggesting that both the pulsar wind luminosity and polar cap heating are governed by the total polar cap current, but the temperature dependence of the luminosity may be influenced by renewed accretion or second exchange events. the spatial distribution of the thermal ( mostly within the cluster halo ) msps suggests that these msps are likely born inside the halo, in which a ns from a progenitor system is transformed into a msp via exchanges of the nss from its companion star.
we introduce an approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) approximation for observation driven time - series models. the main novelty in this approach is to search for the true posterior distribution, assuming that we can simulate from it. in contrast to previous attempts of performing inference from the posterior using maximum likelihood estimators ( mcmc ), we assume that the data are actually generated by a collection of observations. we show that under fairly general conditions, as @xmath0 for the length of the time series, the abc posterior has, almost surely, a map estimator which is different from the true parameter. however, a noisy abc map of such a posterior asymptotically converges to the real parameter almost surely. thus, coupled with the result in proposition [ prop : rel_var ], one has a cost of @xfig : rel : new ] per - iteration for sample from the approximate posterior. this is comparable to the performance of many exact approximations of marginal algorithms ( i.e. the kernel of the markov chain ), and is only one of a new class of algorithms that have recently been proposed to perform well on approximation problems of hidden markov models. we prove that the new algorithm can perform as well or better than the old algorithms, and also that it has a lower cost per iteration. moreover, we give examples to demonstrate its performance on real examples. we also give a new algorithm ( which is competing with the old algorithm in terms of running time ) and illustrate its interest in real life examples. in the appendix we give a qualitative analysis of the stability of the proposed new algorithm. * keywords : * approximation, approximation, observation driven models, approximate bayesville computation, hidden markova models, stochastic differential equations. * ams classification * : primary 60k28, 60j20, 82c20 82c22 22c28 ; secondary 60j25 22c22 21a15 22c20 22d25. * corresponding author : ` gitorious.com ` + dimitrov@dept. of mathematics, university of primorska, titov trg 4, 6000 koper, slovenia + e-mail:dudley.decker@imperial.ac.uk + a.a.s. wong, h.j. lee, a.v. misiurewicz, p. m. snyder + university of cambridge,cambridge, cb3 0he, uk
we present constraints on cosmological parameters from the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of 238 massive galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath0. follow - up _ chandra _ or _ rosat _ observations of 94 of these clusters are incorporated, allowing for conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties. for the first time, we present simultaneous constraints on cluster cosmology and the cluster scaling relations using a rigorous and fully consistent statistical method. the results presented here are among the tightest constraints on dark energy parameters available from any experiment to date. the constraints on the xlf constant model from the combination of xlf and snia data remain consistent with a constant, spatially flat constant model. imposing a constant dark energy equation of state, @xhot0, as a free parameter, we find @xcite, and discuss the implications of this result for dynamic theories of dark matter. our analysis includes the gas mass as a proxy for total mass and avoids the necessity of discarding clusters that have an unexpectedly high gas mass. we compare our results to independent findings in the literature, showing good agreement for the hot, massive clusters used in the analyses of wmap5, snia and bao data. we also demonstrate that the cluster xlf data do not provide a complete ( or complete ) view of the baryonic sector in which the universe is modeled. this tension is addressed through an explicit question : is the cluster gas mass a function of redshift, and is the result of evolution or coincidence? we answer this question in the affirmative, using the best available data set and assuming that the decrease in the mean gas fraction with redshift is a linear function of the mean density of the universe. our results are consistent with recent independent determinations based on gas mass and other observable quantities, and highlight the importance of cluster data in constraining dark energy models.
we present a mass determination of the dark matter in the central regions of the strongly x - ray cluster a2256. the lensing data are in good agreement with the temperature profile for the primary cluster and are used to approximate the density distribution in the inner parts of the cluster. because of the central galaxy projection, the central dark matter concentration is coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy, for which we derive the profile of the density. under the assumption that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster gravitational well, the implied mass is @xmath0, in conflict with the previous finding of beadle et al. ( 1992 ) for a lower mass mass. the mass profile is also used to constrain the slope of the local dark matter density profile. we find that a flat local density profile is ruled out at greater than 99 % confidence, but a slowly rising profile is allowed at larger radii, compatible with hierarchical clustering models. the steepest profiles, which correspond to the outer cluster regions, are also found to be compatible with weak lensing mass estimates. these results favor a model in which the intergalactic gas is not well mixed, has a small density core, and is patchy distributed over a large radial range. we compare our results with those from an isothermal analysis of cluster temperature and density profiles, finding that the isothermal model gives a better fit to the data, but also that the central mass is too high for our lensing analysis. the discrepancy between the measured temperature and the predicted mass is the result of the neglect of the cooling flow region in a2163 and tentative attempts to include this effect in lensing studies. we argue that, rather than requiring that the temperature declines with radius, cluster density profiles with a modest temperature decline are actually more effective than are those that would result from nonisothermality and are therefore justified by the evidence.
we test the detector performance for the forthcoming svom hard x - ray imager ( eclairs ). we first assess the performance of the detectors using the asic isotf - x detector, which will be installed on the xrdpix flight modules. then we select a few asic detectors optimized for an in - flight detection plane at @xmath0 and 600 v. we characterized the detectors performance using long - duration leakage currents and spectral measurements, and their dependence on the bias voltage. we found that the detectors show an abrupt increase in leakage current during the first 10 to 15 minutes of flight, which is followed by a smooth initial shift. the characteristics of the 1 mm thick detectors ( cd(zn)te ) ) remained similar during the whole test. finally, we tested the detectors against the established 4 kev low - energy threshold, and verified their performance with an average energy resolution of 1.8 kev at 59.6 kev. among the selected detectors, about 78 % show an equivalent noise charge ( enc ) value above 20 kev, while the rest show low levels of noise and absorption, similar to the standard cdte detectors. 99 s. chu, l. hollberg, j. e. bjorkholm, a. cable, and a. ashkin, ` ` the vv gamma - ray burst telescope, '' astrophys. j. * 136 *, 319 - 324 ( 2008 ). c. l. lundeen, b. c. j. sadoff, r. r. ammar, p. van loock, and i. a. walmsley, " science * 306 *, 824 - 827 ( 2006 ). m. d. ludlow, s. heinzel, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, and x. zhang, _ high energy gamma rays from the sun, _ ( springer, berlin heidelberg, 2009 ). d. fujimoto, t. kobayashi, w. tittel, and h. rubinsztein - dunlop, " xmm - newton _, 10 - 12 ( 2010 ). t. iskhakov, v. vuletic, and m. g. lonczewski, polarization effect in high - energy gamma - rays detectors, " nasa / goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 08544
the paper tries to establish a generic phase space scenario for the optimum development of the time evolution of a dynamical system possessing @xmath0 well - defined saddle - node pairs of fixed points. the described scenario, that we call the _ generalized landau scenario _, is based on the nonlinear mixing of a large number of characteristic oscillation modes in the phase space through the intertwinement of invariant manifolds of the corresponding limit cycles. the analysis is founded on the behavior of a class of systems that, due to the accumulation of such a nonlinear mix of modes, are able to exploit fully the instability capabilities of a saddle - point pair or a single fixed point up to the optimum condition of the system. we conjecture that under optimum circumstances, all of them can appear together together together on the physical intuition expressed by landau through its phenomenological theory tentatively explaining the onset of turbulence like a combination of oscillations. such a kind of evolution can be appreciated as a component of a wide variety of observable time evolutions in the world, from cosmological to atomic levels, in contexts where both reproduction and adaptation often lack any meaning. along this line and by developing the analysis within the abstract level of the dynamical systems, we perceive a generic asymmetry of opportunity between the building and deconstruction of mode mixing potentially occurring in a given parcel of reality in interaction with its environment. in other words, we could expect the ( natural ) occurrence of local accumulations of dynamical complexity in the current ( time evolution ) functioning of life implying modification ( in fact, increase ) of its underlying structural organization. we sustain it on three complementary ingredients : i ) the elementary steps and prefigured courses of complexity building associated with the generalizedlandau scenario, as allowed by the generic possibilities of the oscillatory systems, ii ) the evolutionary arrow propelled by the linearity of the interplay between the occurrence of appropriate circumstances for oscillatory mixing and the divergence of chaotic signals, and iii ) the principle of respecting the local existence of the entropy tendency in isolated systems, as implied by the very existence of a stable thermodynamic equilibrium state for such systems. the second ingredient in our scenario is the gradual dominance of the second law of the expected dominant mode dominant for the majority of situations. in this sense, it is like landau s landau equation implying that the ultimate limit of the number of oscillatory modes emerged from a single microscopic dynamical capability. as for the third ingredient, we imagine an extremely rich string of stochastic solutions for the problem of
a review is presented based on zero - field, near - field optical spectroscopy of the metallic free electron plasma edge in the two dimensional topological insulator bi@xmath0sb@xday at temperatures below @xmath1. the conductivity spectra display numerous weakly interacting free electron localized surface states ( sss ), which are characterized by a number density of landau levels ( lls ). based on a model of the magnetic field dependence of the drude plasma edge, we show that the strongest lls are those resulting from transitions between sss in the bulk and the surface states. we identify the sss as being due to a combination of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface dirac band and linear dirac point motion, allowing us to quantitatively probe the origin of the observed lls. we find that the scattering of lls from the bulk is _ not _ uniform but rather is distributed in a helical manner approximately in the direction perpendicular to the bisectrix axis and in the same direction as the _ k_-vector of the electric field. we explicitly demonstrate that the observed scattering is not due to the _ a priori _ bulk band structure, and that the bulk fs ellipsoids do not contain the required 2d fs. we also present a model for the optical ll absorption features, in which they are produced by cyclotron resonances in magnetic field. the model is able to account for the observed behavior of the highest energy lls and other field - dependent features, and it provides a simple and physically motivated explanation for all of the below temperature optical spectra. we suggest that the additional, bulk sss may exist, but are difficult to observe, especially in high magnetic fields. plasmas are a promising material for the production of new strongly - correlated phase - coherent superconducting systems. a previously recognized class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides, or high - transition - temperature ( ghz ) materials, and with strong spin - orbit coupling, such as ytterbium ( yb ) or strontium ( ssb ), generate a large number of strong interacting electron states. the interactions between electrons on the transition " are thus strong, leading to optical transitions between relativistic dirac bands that are strongly interacting. the interaction energy between the electrons and the dirac points in yb and strsb leads to the formation of magnetic delocalized sss and therefore to the existence of optical phonons.
the fluid - fluid ( f - f ) bifurcation analysis of a binary mixture of parallel hard spheres is performed in three dimensions. the main goal of this work is to study the fluid - solid phase separation as a function of mixture size asymmetry and dimensionality between the two fluid phases of the binary mixture. this is possible because the simple hypercubic lattice is the most stable configuration of particles in a crystalline phase and the same should be true also in the demixed phase when small cubes occupy a very small fraction of the total volume. the other reason for this is that the fundamental measure density functional theory developed for a hard sphere mixture, namely the hard sphere ( hs ) mixture, gives the most accurate results for the freezing transition as compared to other density functional theories. the same is true for the case of binary mixtures of hard spheres with anisotropic particles occupying large spheres, in spite of the fact that the hs mixture is more amenable to simulation study because of its simpler structure. we also show that at intermediate mixture sizes ( dimensionally @xmath0 ) and asymptotically large hypercubes ( i.e. with large spheres ) dominate the phase separation in the two fluids. within the framework of the first two dimensional ( 2d ) super - resolution calculations we have found that in a wide range of parameters ( dimensionality and asymmetry ) the f - ferromagnetic fluid - hard - sphere mixture is metastable with respect to the fluids - solid demixing. we have also studied the region of the parameter space occupied by small spheres and have confirmed that this result holds up to the 9th dimension. for higher dimensionality we have carried out a finite - size scaling analysis of the pair correlation functions in the one - component fluid and have compared the results with those obtained by monte carlo simulations. we find the same result up to dimension 25. in the second part of the paper we analyze ( i ) the extreme case of zero - dimensional hard spheres and ( ii ) a bimodal polydisperse mixture of perturbed hard spheres in the hard hypersphere according to the distribution of a radial function on the continuum and using the same experimental tool we have analyzed the fermi level ( the direct correlation functions ) and ( iii ) the two - component distribution functions as was used in our previous work for the simulation results, we have shown that this is preempted by the freezing of one of the segregated phases of hs.
we study the properties of a sample of 96 radio galaxies selected from the 10c survey in the lockman hole. to distinguish between high and low - excitation radio galaxies ( hergs ), three different methods are used ; optical compactness, x - ray observations and mid - infrared colour colour diagrams. these methods are combined to produce overall herg and lergs classifications ; a total of 32 sources are classified as ` probable hergs ', 35 as ` likely lrgs'and 17 sources remain unclassified. we find that hergs display a range of radio properties, a higher fraction of hergs are also found to be luminous and have steep spectra ; the spectra therefore tend to be used as a diagnostic of orientation. a high fraction of the sources in the at20 g sample are found at redshifts between 0.2 and 1.4 but have linear sizes which are typically @xmath0 kpc. this suggests that the majority of these objects are radio galaxies. in contrast, the hergs at low redshift display much flatter spectra and tend to have smaller sizes. some of these hergs do not have the extended emission lines typical of fanaroff riley ( fr ) sources and we suggest that this difference is likely to be due to a physical difference between hergs and fr0 sources, where the fr0s are more extended and lie closer to the line - of - sight. we also find a divide in luminosity between the two radio morphological classes ; the higher - luminosity hergs have typical luminosities, while the frii sources have the highest surface brightnesses and have more collimated jets. we investigate the origins of this divide and find that it is likely that the reasons for the different proportions of fr0 / fr1 sources in both samples are related to their different accretion modes. epsf.def psfig.sty [ firstpage ] galaxies : active galaxies : evolution galaxies : radio galaxies : luminosity function radio continuum : galaxies x - rays : galaxies
we develop and test two dynamical monte carlo methods for simulating the dynamics of a particle moving in an inhomogeneous medium in the presence of sharp viscosity or, in general, diffusivity. the methods are based on the @xmath0 calculus and extend the well - known brownian dynamics ( ito ) and langevin dynamics ( ld ) methods in the ito formulation. for the ld method, we design a small box which contains an arbitrarily strong kinetic field corresponding to the deterministic constant of the equation of motion for the particle in the box. projecting the motion of the random walker onto the direction perpendicular to the interface reduces the problem to a 1d one. if the interface is a sharp one, the method considers the particle to be located at a particular location among the available sites " such that the time increment of the _ time step _ during the walk is not a part of the basic algorithm. however, in the case of a sharp interface, there are other methods ( _ dynamical mc _ ) which do reproduce the principal aspects of the dynamics and even the correct time scale of the process. in fact, it is shown that even though our mc methods are generally faster, the dynamics are the same at all points _ unless _ care is taken to adjust the step length and/or time increment at every mc step. thus, our algorithms should generalize straightforwardly to the latter case. as a by - product of this paper, we obtain some useful insights into the computational feasibility of the various simulation approaches we used. we also present detailed comparisons between different methods ( bd, ld, mc ) and results of the simulations. we end the paper with a discussion of possible uses of the methods developed here and their future generalizations.
we present a quantum theoretical study of the intersubband electroluminescence from a semiconductor microcavity in the incoherent transport regime, i.e. when the coupling to the electronic contacts concerns only the electron populations. the system under study is described by the following model, consisting of two quantum well conduction subbands, with a separated in - plane wavevector between the two subbands. we employ a cluster expansion method to truncate the infinite hierarchy of dynamical equations for the relevant expectation values of operator products. at the present level of approximation, we have been able to describe incoherent electron transport through the dynamics of the electron transport in the two electronic subband populations and the electrolumininescence through the dynamical evolution of the cavity photon population, which is coupled to the correlations between the coulomb interaction, the quantum well and the contact electronic fields. we have shown the appearance of cavity polariton resonances in the emission spectra, when a large density of electrons occupies the fundamental subband. the vacuum rabi splitting decreases with increasing voltage and we have successfully described the photonic output in the different transport conditions. our results show that the quantum efficiency of the light - emitting diode can be considerably enhanced with respect to the case in which the van der waals interaction is weak, passing from the weak to the strong coupling regime. 99 p. kok, w. j. munro, k. nemoto, t. c. ralph, j. p. dowling, and g. forbes, ` ` three - photon linewidth engineering, '' physical review letters * 83 *, 163601 ( 2007 ). c. weisbuch, m. nishioka, y. shimakawa, h. takahashi, a. ishida, and m. a. linewein, _ light : photonic systems _ ( springer - verlag, heidelberg, 2009 ). i. kuznetsova, f. v. konotop, and y. s. kennedy ` ` cavity polaritons in metallic nanostructures, '' phys. rev. lett. * 112 *, 143904 ( 2009 ) r. k. wang + _ department of physics, tokyo institute of technology _, kashiwa, chiba 277 - 8583, japan _ + _ graduate school of information science and technology, huaiyunsan university
we present a compilation of flux densities in different wavelength bands for 27 blazars which are considered to be egret sources. the observations were made with the compton gamma ray observatory ( cta ), the nir millimeter and the sub - millimeter telescopes. we calculate the ratios of the @xmath0-ray flux density to the flux density in the optical ( 90 ghz, 230 ghz ) band and find a correlation between the two. when bl lac objects are excluded, the correlation becomes less significant. we consider several emission models, including synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) radiation, external compton scattering and compton up - scattering of internal seed photons. we find that the ssc model is the most consistent with the data. for the optical - derived doppler factors, a linear regression analysis suggests that a factor of 4 - 5 higher than the observed flux density. when comparing the predicted and observed ssc flux, one finds that relativistic beaming is required to explain the high - energy radiation. the observed low - energy component, presumably produced in the jet, is mainly produced by the s sc process in the presence of nonthermal electrons. the contribution of the starlight to the optical emission can be reduced by using the maximum available flux. we present a spectral energy distribution of a typical blazar and discuss the implications of the results for blazar models. # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, # 2, # 3.#1| # 2| # 3 % # 1eq.([#1 ] ) # 1fig.

we use deep mid - infrared ( 24@xmath1 m ) and x - ray data from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and the _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ ( 4ms and 2ms, respectively ) to identify galaxies containing heavily obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ). we identify infrared excess star - forming galaxies ( sbzks ) in the 4ms cdfs field with strong excess infrared emission ( rest - frame equivalent width @xmath2 ) similar to that detected in heavily obscured agn, and using a similar selection technique to identify bzk galaxies in the same area of the goods - s field. we find that the mid - ir selection technique, which has been exploited previously to identify candidate bzks, mis - selects galaxies with significant infrared emission in the _ herschel _ deep field and thus overestimates the star - formation rates ( sfrs ) for such galaxies by up to a factor of two, when compared with those derived using other ir selection techniques. we detect the majority of sbxks with excess ir emission ( 64 % ), but we find a significant fraction ( 36 % ) that do not have significant ir excess. we construct a composite spectrum that shows that much of the ir excess is due to re - radiation of ir photons and we argue that heavily obscured and unobscured agn are more likely to reside in heavily reddened galaxies than are the most reddened objects in the sample. we determine that the space density of compton thick agn at @x0 is comparable to that of unobscively agn ( 3.6 % of the universe s stellar mass ) at this redshift, but this may be at least partially due to the significant contributions of dusty star formation and agn light contamination at low and intermediate redshifts. we discuss the implications of these results for the co - evolution of galaxies dominated by dust and supermassive black holes, as well as the metallicity of the cosmic ` ` agn desert ''.

the concept of using metasurfaces as full - reflection detectors opens a new route towards engineering a conceptually new kind of lenses : one consisting of an ultimately thin single layer of sub - wavelength inclusions providing near - diffraction - limit focusing of electromagnetic energy at a chosen point. such strong focusing abilities have been achieved with a lens based on hetero - junctions of anisotropic metamaterials. however, the design of such an array becomes very challenging since the inclusions must operate in a metamirror at non - resonant frequencies and must be adjusted very precisely taking into account their mutual interaction. without loss of generality, we content ourselves with the case when the metalens confines energy on its axial line at a focal distance @xmath0. through the use of a one - dimensional array of such inclusions, we can effectively emulate the two - dimensional scenario in free space where the structure is infinitely periodic in the vertical direction. the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the unit cells are homogeneous in the sense that the averaged electromagnetic response varies smoothly over the structure. we demonstrate the potential and flexibility of this concept by considering two example structures. one consists of a flat, prismatic structure reflecting normally incident waves, while the other is a reflecting _ metalens _ ( a single - layer focusing sheet ). although the proposed concept is generic and can be applied over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, we design and experimentally measure structures operating in the microwave frequency band ( in the g - band ). the proposed metalens can find various applications within the electromagnetic spectrum due to its unique characteristics : for example, replacing parabolic dish antennas with planar and low - profile structures, micrometer - scale light concentrators, and integrated optical lenses. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 p. pringsheim, ` ` zwei bemerkungen ber den unterschied von lumineszenz - und temperaturstrahlung, '' zeitschrift fr extraterrestrische physik * 57 *, 739746 ( 1929 ). p. ben - abdallah and p. tiefenbacher, _ applied physics of the microwave spectrum _ ( springer - verlag, heidelberg, germany, new york, 2000 ). m. fleischhauer, a. imamoglu, and s. d. lasserre, _ radio antennas for parabolic antennas _ ( vanderbilt
cross - section limits for chargino and neutralino production in @xmath0 collisions are calculated in the framework of the contrained minimal supersymmetric standard model. the results are used to set the 95 % confidence level limit on chargino production as a function of the leptonic branching ratio and to constrain the branching ratio of neutralino associated production to within about a gev of the kinematic limit. for the case of a light scalar lepton, the observed limits are not significantly larger than the expected ones. in the light of these limits, the neutralino search can be used to rule out regions of susy parameter space which are not accessible to the chargino search. 0.2 cm 0.3 cm plus 1pt minus 1pt @=11 versim#1#20.4ex @=12 0 ps. ps@xmath1 = 11 # 1#2#3 ^ 2 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 1, apj, * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 08 - 065 issn 0418 - 9833 + june 2008 + * cross section limits on both * chargino ( hadronic and semileptonic ) and * neutralino ( neutralino ) production at * # 1 * + the opal collaboration + ( to be submitted to phys. lett. b ) + 0.5 cm m. ackermann @xcite, z. bai @xcit_i _ and _ abdus salam international center for theoretical physics, + p.o. box 513, 34100 trieste, italy + + _ physics department, university of california, berkeley, usa _ + _ email : bianchi@phys.desy.edu.cn + _ address for correspondence : _ dipartimento di fisica, universit di roma ` ` la sapienza '', + infn, sezione di padova, vicolo dellosservatorio 5, i-35122, padova ( italy ) + _ tel : + 81 - 55 - 701 - 6859 + fax : ( 505 ) 665 - 1923 + _ e - mail : bai@pd.astro.c.l.edex.u.s. + _ * key words : * supersymmetry, cms, chargino, neutralino + production, decay, opal, dark matter
we present the results of a detailed analysis of the x - ray spectrum of ngc3783. the central source in the galaxy exhibits luminosity fluctuations of about a factor 1.0 on time scales of 20120 days. the observed spectra consist of at least two kinematic components, outflowing at @xmath0 ^-1 kms@xmath1 and with a covering factor of about 10 %. a major new finding is the presence of a long wavelength absorber along the line of sight. the width of the feature is consistent with that expected for a gravitationally bound, metal - rich gas. other important results are the multi - component nature of the absorber and the large range of ionization. in fact, the absorption in the long wavelength region is dominated by features of k - shell carbon and nitrogen and l - shell nitrogen and oxygen. the ionization balance of iron depends critically on the dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rates that are not well known for the iron m - shell ions. we investigate several subsets of the data. first, we search for spectral variations as a function of source luminosity and/or time. this is done for short ( i.e. within the individual 170 ks observations ) time scales. then we separate the entire data set into groups with high and low softness ratios. we find four observations ( 2090, 2091, 2092 and 2094 ) with lowsoftness ratio and two ( 0373 and 2093 ) with high softness ratio. we refer to these as the ` ` low- '' and ` ` high - state '' observations, respectively. in light of these results, we have examined the spectral properties of the gas during its photoionization by the central agn. the uv absorbers are also uv emitters, and the low - ionization component can also contribute to the observed uv emission lines. we do not know the origin of the soft continuum source. simple energy considerations show that this phenomenon is unrelated to the appearance of broad emission features like, and likely arises in relativistic disk lines. in addition, we show that the two high state spectra are inconsistent with the assumption of a simple response of the absorbing gas to continuum variations.
we describe a new class of non - hermitian quantum theories that describe the dynamics of the quantum system. the theory defined by this class of theories is mathematical rather than physical in character, and this is one consequence of the requirement that the hamiltonian operator @xmath0 is unitary. we begin by pointing out that the hermiticity requirement implies that the time evolution of a quantum system be unitary ( probability - conserving ). because the expected result of a measurement of a state can not grow or decay in time, we are proposing here to consider the possibility suggested by complex group analysis that a quantum theory of elementary particles must also satisfy the physical axioms of lorentz covariance and causality. we then describe how to calculate the eigenvalues of a ` ` 1-symmetric '' type of hamiltonians and we discuss the many physical implications of these new theories. in particular, we show that the dynamical system in the non - analytically - derived time evolution class defined by these theories must satisfy the physically equivalent condition of space - time reflection symmetry, which is the condition that the unitary time evolution requires. we also describe an example of a non - axiomatized quantum theory that describes radioactive decay. the final part of this paper deals with the issue of the physical interpretation of the recent breakthroughs that have been made in the last decade in the field of ` ` field theory. '' the breakthroughs have included the proof of correctness of the interpretation of quantum field theory by discovering new examples and models, proving new theorems, and performing numerical and asymptotic analyses of the decay process. the crucial theoretical questions of conservation of probability and time evolution are addressed in detail. we end with a brief discussion of the implications of describing radio - quiet quantum mechanics. = cmbx10 scaled 4truecm = cmr10 = cmti10 scaled 2truecm * introduction * the theory of quantum mechanics is an integral theory of the world * s. j. bender and r. boettcher + department of physics and astronomy, university of maryland, + college park, md 20742, usa + tel./fax 0039 080 5443144 + fax : ( 505 ) 665 - 3493 ; e - mail : bender@umd.edu.au +
we report on the results of multiwavelength observations of the blazar markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) in march 1996 and april 1997. data from _ asca _ ( kev ), _ egret _ ( gev ) and _ whipple _ ( tev ) are presented and compared with the optical observations. we detect a detection of 3.5 @xmath0-ray emission from the source in the 3.2 day period of peak flux, and a month later later we report an even stronger detection, at 4.2 days, with 4.0@xmath1 significance ( e @xfig2 100 mev ). the detection is the first since the first tev detection in 1996. in view of the recent rise of tev activity, we suggest that the detected tev emission is most likely synchrotron radiation, rather than inverse - compton radiation. the data show two spectral breaks, with the first being in the ir to optical band, and the second in the x ray band, likely due to a change in the maximum energy of electrons radiating at the peak of the peak. the spectrum shows no sign of klein - nishina cutoff in the mev band. we construct the full time - dependent spectra and fitting one - zone models for the source during the flare, and find that the observed spectra can be described by a hard photon - dependent bremsstrahlung emission with a photon index of about 1.9. the derived magnetic field and beaming factor for the flare state are similar to those derived for the quasar - type blazars associated with known high - luminosity blackbodies, and are about a factor of 30 to 100 fainter than the values appropriate for the general blazar population. for the epoch of high activity, our model predicts a spectral break in the tev band, which is in good agreement with the observed spectrum. we also describe the behaviour of the monte carlo simulations of the source, and conclude that the most likely explanation for the observed flux variations in the past two years is inverse compton emission from a single electron population. # 1to 0pt#1 [ firstpage ] gamma - rays : observations bl lacerta objects : general radiation mechanisms : nonthermalization x rays : general
we present the first high - resolution 850 @xmath0 m continuum maps of the two prestellar cores l1498 and l1517b, both of which are thought to be on the verge of protostellar collapse. the data were obtained with the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ). scuba was used to split the bright and intermediate groups into ` bright'and ` intermediate'groups. the delineation of the dividing line between the two groups was made by comparison with iras point source catalogue data. we used the stokes i ( intensity ) and stokes ii ( velocity dispersion ) maps to map the global orientation of the magnetic field and to estimate the strength of the field in the plane of the sky. our data are consistent with a uniform magnetic field, out to the maximum radius probed by the scuba camera, with an indication that the field is slightly tilted in the direction of the core longitudes. the offset between the projected major axis of the cores measured with scuba and that of the mid - infrared space observatory ( iso ) maps is consistent with the core being at the northwestern end of a filament extending from the main cloud to the southeast. the ip of the magnetically - uniform field is coincident with the filament seen in iso maps. the total linewidths are used to determine the virial masses, m@xmath1, that could be supported by the observed mass - to - flux ratios, and found them to be 0.8 and 0.4m@xfig2. for both cores the values listed above were obtained from the same data, which we have compared with the values previously obtained from magnetic field measurements and from crutcher et al. ( 2004 ). although these values could be slightly different, we present evidence that the two cores belong to the same group and that although they have somewhat different morphologies they are consistent in terms of the mass, density, core age, core mass and core mass. applying the centre of curvature ( cf ) technique to our data shows that the cf method provides a plane - of - sky magnetic field strength for l15 17b of @xfig130 @xday0 g. in contrast, the cf technique fails to generate a field strength directly from the magnetic cores and requires additional work to remove the random scatter from the cores.

we present an analysis of a 30 ks observation of the magellanic irregular, starburst galaxy ngc 4449 by the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory. the galaxy was observed in h@xmath0 emission, also in x - rays, and in the @xmath1 kev band with the s3 chip on a similar orbit to that of the galaxy in the optical plane. the total emission in the 30 kev range is 0.016 times the nw emission, 0.017 times the w e emission and 0.015 times the s i h emission, with most emission falling within regions of increased star formation and the remaining in regions of less intense star - formation. the x- and hi morphologies follow each other closely and are found to be associated with star clusters, ob associations and super star clusters ( sss ) within the galaxy. there is evidence within the observation for unresolved point sources, most of which are likely to be sssrs. we find that the h+abs emission is associated with the star clusters and that the hi halo extends out to the south - west, with a large density of hi clouds lying within this region. we also find evidence for a super - wind, labelled sb / sw, extending along the north - w and south - east sides of the bubble and extending beyond the se and w e emissions. these features may be indicative of a blowing super - bubble and/or of the release of hot gas in the form of a wind. we discuss the implications of these results and conclude that this type of wind can happen in a number of small galaxies at high redshift.

we present a microscopic model of superconductivity in the model which couples the @xmath0-band order parameter in the gl gl free energy functional with the strain tensor and the pair transfering between the two order parameters, to describe the behavior of the superconducting and ordinary phases in the presence of pressure. the dependence of the critical temperatures on the coefficient of the coulomb repulsion is shown. an important change in the electronic properties of the material under pressure is an important factor which can change the critical fermi level and can give evidence for a second - order phase transition. we discuss the possibility of observing this second phase by specific - heat experiments and we show that the change in critical temperatures can be experimentally detected in the case of pressure exceeding a critical value. in the recent experimental and theoretical works on superconductors, it has been observed that in some cases, in the paramagnetic phase of mgb@xmath1-electrons, there are two distinct energy gaps in the free energy of the two bands of the normal ( degenerate ) superconductor, arising due to the energy difference between them. it is the case that for certain values of the coupling parameters ( e.g., pairing strength or thermal conductivity ) the energy gap in one band is larger than that in the other. this crossover from a normal to a second order phase is due to an electronic topological transition of 5/2 order parameter. here we consider the case where two bands which are degenerate and have the same symmetry are responsible for the difference in the two gap sizes. in this case, even if at zero temperature the two critical temperatures are the same, there is a crossover pressure which will split the critical temperature ( gap ) in the first order, giving rise to a new critical temperature in the second order. we suggest that this second critical temperature can be measured by penetration depth experiments, where the experimental resolution can be different from the first one. the model calculation can also be done with the help of the phase diagram, which takes into account the hexagonal symmetry of the boron layers and the effects of anisotropic dirac fermionization.
we present results from analysis of a set of simultaneous _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) and _ asca _ ) observations of the heavily obscured low mass black hole ( lmxb ) x 1822@xmath0371. our analysis assumes that the x - rays originate from an optically thick corona ( @xmath1kev ) and a much weaker optically thin corona ; that the corona is magnetized and that the l - edges of the fe k - edge are ionized. we also consider the effects of obscuration by both the secondary ( assumed to be roche lobe filling ) and by the accretion disc rim. modeling the lightcurves in several energy bands, we find no unambiguous evidence for blackbody emission from the surface of the compact object that is scattered into our line of sight. although a broad range of possible models are presented, we arrive at the following conclusions : _ we can understand the observed variability as arising from comptonization of a wien tail in a low temperature corona. the specific accretion rate onto the secondary is strongly variable over the orbital timescales investigated, and is at least an order of magnitude larger than that from the mass of the primary. a common envelope phase is avoided by strong mass loss from the primary, perhaps in an advection dominated accretion phase. even as mass transfer commences, the mass loss will continue to be driven on the thermal time scale. _ we discuss the implications of these results for high energy astrophysical interpretations of the ` x-1'system and point out what we believe to be future avenues for obtaining high energy x- ray spectra from the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ telescopes.
the interplay between the coulomb repulsive force and phase space constraints is investigated in a large hadronic @xmath0 decay sample recorded by the opal detector at lep. the measured bose - einstein correlations, including the three independent one - particle and two - particle correlations, are used to estimate the size of the emitter. the two - boson correlation is found to give a significant enhancement in the measured bec of three charged pions, which is further enhanced by a factor two. these correlations are also measured for the first time in a system of three identical bosons. the value of the integrated boson density in momentum space and its ratio to the boson inclusive cross section is determined, and the correlation function for the three - charged pion system is derived, taking into account the recent proposal of a pure goldstone boson background. pacs numbers : 12.38.mh, 12.39.ba = -0.3 cm plus 2 mm minus 2 mm # 1#2#3 _ ann. phys.

we continue the analysis of two - dimensional simulations of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsn ) that include convection and the stationary accretion shock instability ( sasi ), both of which have been performed with the zeus+idsa code. we develop fully relativistic corrections to the approximate 2d self gravity and emphasize the need for a multidimensional implementation of the neutrino transport. present simulations cover a total volume of about 23000 @xmath0, or about 50 % of the main - sequence mass - loss volume at the time of the explosion. we synthesize the explosion models in a self - consistent manner and analyze the subsequent evolution of the mass and energy flux through the shock. the major new result is that the quiescent accretion phase, which had previously been dominated by the sasi, transitions into a period of quiescence during which the competing energies of neutrinos and self - gravitating matter give way to a large loss of mass. the aspherical model, in which the shock is treated in the ` ` ray - by - ray '' approximation, correctly reproduces the properties of the post - shock matter, including its velocity, momentum, and energy loss. in contrast, the simulations with newtonian ` ` self - gravity '' or ` ` approximate galactocentricity '' show a strong decline of mass accretion rates with time, which we attribute to the loss of numerical ` ` resolution '' and the consequent increase in computational costs. we also examine the influence of the large - scale morphology on the explosion and find that in the models with more massive progenitors, the explosion is more likely to occur near the center of mass rather than near the ring around the black hole. we discuss the prospects of using the 3d chimera code to perform the fully 2d simulations and examine the prospects for integrating these simulations into the main sequence.
we discuss a new form of bcs - bec crossover theory for superfluids which builds on the standard bcs theory of interacting trapped bose einstein condensation ( bec ). this new theory is based on the observation that, in contrast to the usual bcs ground state wave function, the relative strength of the pairing interaction can be tuned continuously from weak to strong via feshbach resonance in the presence of a magnetic field. we present a set of criteria set for evaluating this new approach in the context of ultracold trapped gases in order to obtain a complete and consistent description of the superfluid phase. these criteria include ( i ) a consistent treatment of the many - body feynman diagram which is the basis for the widely observed pseudogap phenomena in fermionic superfluids, ( ii ) the behavior of the thermodynamical properties associated with the collective excitations, ( iii ) a theory in which the collective modes are not self coupled to the excitations and, in the absence of pair interaction, appear to be independent of the excitation gap and order parameter, which implies that the effective interaction strength @xmath0 should not depend on the pair size and should not modify the low temperature properties of the condensate. we test this scheme on a number of critical calculations for helium trapped gases, and find them to be qualitatively consistent with experiment. nevertheless, we find that the theory is _ not _ demonstrably consistent with the hamiltonian - based equations of motion for bec, for reasons which are briefly discussed in the present here. we also discuss alternative renditions of the present scheme which attempt to capture the physics of trapped fermi gases in a form more akin to that of superconductors. in particular to this scheme are the self consistent equations describing the time evolution of the zero temperature bcs superfluid from zero temperature to the observation of condensates with large pair sizes and finite excitation gaps, and the first order parameterization of the number equation. we finally discuss how the standard bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) approach, which has been widely applied to this problem, is salvagable for the case of a purely repulsive, weakly interacting bec.
the dynamics of networks can be modeled via the spin market models. the interest in such models is driven by the attempts to understand the relationship between dynamics of a population of interacting social individuals and economic interactions. the existing models can be roughly classified by the power - law ( exponential decay ) or nearly exponential ( gaussian random field ) distributions. the purpose of this paper is to propose a new spin market model that fully exploits the self - organized formation of the stationary distribution of _ strategic variables _ constituted by the set of inherent fields and couplings. the introduction of extremal dynamics and adaptivity allows us to avoid the exponential decay and rewire the network to resemble the social network of a social network. the core of the model is characterized by the exponent @xmath0 of the probability density function characterizing the volatility of the log - price returns after a one - day visit to the most successful leader. we show that the emergence of long - term memory of network properties is due to node aging and time - dependent attachment probability of the node. our approach closely resembles the existing mathematical characterization of social networks based on preferential attachments that addresses the issue of minority game. + * keywords * : spin market, complex networks, extreme value dynamics, social networks, network self - organization, social transitivity, asymmetric spin exchange. the dynamics of complex networks has been the subject of considerable research activity in recent years. a variety of models have been proposed for elucidating relations between the topology of the network and the behavior of its constituents. some of them are loosely connected social networks that are loosely categorized as power - laws @xcite. among them, the well - known multity property of the population of social ties ( ml ) has been referred to as _ leadergate_. in these models, the individual ( or sect ) links are linked to their _ follower _ nodes by a _ node _, where the follower node _ attaches to the _ leader _ ( i.e. the node connected to the actual node of the leader ). in the so - called _ co - evolutionary spin market _ models, strategies are stronglyavored by the inter - agent exchanges. the motivation to develop these models stems from the evolutionary view that allows agents to adapt strategy based on past experience rather than on current knowledge of current available information. accordingly, the above - mentioned spin models often suffer from the paradoxical abidance in minority occupation as opposed to the minority occupation. as a consequence, they are often cast as resulting from a _ collective behavior _ of the
we consider the heat capacity of fermionic systems with a single electron spectrum ( i.e. with an equal level spacing @xmath0 ) and arbitrary fermi energy ( or energy level density @xfig1 ) and geometry. in this chapter a set of general relativistic polynomial forms of the fermion heat capacity is presented that can be used to describe the energy and temperature behavior of mesoscopic low - temperature heat capacity. the formulation of this statistical mechanical approach leads to the description of the process of thermalization of the system as an exponential growth with temperature. with the introduction of the independent particle formalism we give a general recipe for the calculation of the energy as a function of particle number, shape, temperature and the type of confinement. our method is applied to systems with any energy level distribution and arbitrary particle numbers. it can be applied to both macroscopic and micro - sized systems. at each stage of the evolution the dependence of the thermal behavior on the particle number is extremely well described by the self - consistent free energy spectra of the considered systems. we give the formulae for the maximal and minimum temperatures corresponding to the closed shells and the corresponding maxima in the harmonic analysis. # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 desy 10 - 084 issn 0418 - 9833 + december 2010 + * fermions as degrees of freedom : thermal properties of isolated mesoscopic systems * + m. frlich@xmath2, d. j. s. l. pietrinfn - basque country research center, p.o. institut fr theoretische physik und astrophysik, universitt bonn, + werner heisenbergstrasse 1, 85741 - 857, garching, germany. + e - mail : m.f.pettcher@unibo.ch, g.p.s.zayas@mail.univ-bonn.germany.gov + _ msc - classes : _ 60k37, 60k35, 82c - 82b27, 60j25, 82b28, 60y10, 12d25, 12f30, 12g60. + _ licensing provisions : _ none + _ programming language : _ fortran ( main program ) + _ computer : _ any computer that supports a unix - like operating system ( with or without a for
we investigate the properties of galaxies in a cosmological context using a pair of large - scale n - body simulations of galaxy formation. the simulations use a set of cold dark matter initial conditions to resolve the formation and evolution of dark matter halos over cosmologically significant volumes. simple prescriptions for gas cooling rates, star formation, supernova feedback, galaxy - galaxy merging and the evolution of the stellar populations within galaxies are adopted. we investigate how the selection of galaxies by luminosity, colour or type influences the results. we use the pairwise peculiar velocities of 1580 galaxies from the simulations to compute the luminosity functions, two - point spatial correlations, cluster velocity gradients, @xmath0 colours and the k - band tully - fisher relation. we find that in both the low-@xmath1 model and the high - density @x0cdm model, the absence of galaxies forming stars at significant rates in the i - band luminosity function suggests that either dust extinction in star - forming galaxies prevents star formation in low - mass halos or feedback is strong enough to prevent galaxies from forming stars in massive systems. in the low - density model, we can not reliably constrain the values of several cosmetically important physical parameters, for example the value of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies, the abundance of supernovae and the supernova rate in galaxies. we conclude that it is not possible to constrain these parameters even with excellent agreement with galaxy surveys. we also investigate the effect of dust extinction on predictions for the galaxy distribution at redshift. in both models produce galaxies that look significantly different from their analogues, whether this is due to their morphology, stellar mass, bolometric luminosity or a combination of these two. for the model with low metallicity, which has been proposed to describe the normalization of the universe through the use of dust, the colours of galaxies according to the dust - free - floating model are in better agreement with observations than the colours obtained with the analytic merging trees of kauffmann & white.

we present new three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the interstellar medium in a central @xmath0pc region around a supermassive black hole(@xmath1 ) at a galactic center. we focus on the effect of ongoing star formation on the ism structure and dynamics. supernova rate is varied with respect to fuv intensity to obtain a range of supernova rates in a given region. in our previous model, supernovae are assumed to explode in a spherical region with a resolution of 0.125 pc. with this resolution, we track the time evolution of the molecular hydrogen ( h_2 ) and its radiative and collisional destruction. the gas forms an inhomogeneous disk whose scale - height becomes larger in the outer region, and its velocity field is highly turbulent in the torus. outflow of the hot molecular gas forms a hot funnel in the inner region. its gas column densities toward the nucleus are found if the viewing angle is smaller than @xma0 from the edge - on. however, the column density are distributed over almost two orders of magnitude around the average for any given viewing angle due to the clumpy nature of the rotational disk. our models confirm the presence of a funnel - like cavity, but they also suggest that the gas is mainly distributed in high density regions. we also find that the vertical velocity dispersion of the gas becomes larger toward high latitudes, which is qualitatively similar to the situation in ngc 1097 by vlti / keck. this suggests that the molecular gas disk could survive around active galactic nuclei in various types of agns and quasars without a prominent starburst associated with their activities. we compare our models with the recently observed co(1 - 0 ) emission in several nearby seyfert galaxies. the line - center optical depths are comparable to those of the virialized rotational gas in the disks of nearby galaxies, suggesting that there is a negligible amount of cold molecular gas around typical agns. stars : formation ism : kinematics and dynamics methods : numerical.
the move the graphic beta move is a transformation of a graph into another which is a graph in @xmath0. more precisely, we may apply the move to any graph which contains a pattern ( subgraph ) and we obtain a new graph which is identical with the initial one, with the exception of the pattern. in some figures, for clarity, i introduce a family of moves, called ` ` fanout moves '', which are very similar to the well - known k - moves in graphical lambda calculus. the moves are independent of the particular embeddings of the graph and are used for the better understanding of the relation between crossings in the lambda calculus and crossings in emergent algebras. in the paper http://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/ember/15/turing-machines-i-the-three-moirai/[here ], the algorithm was described in detail ( it is called fanoutmove ) and the moves were compared with the ones of a lambda calculus source ( the k - move ). the algorithm starts with the representation of the lambda abstraction operation as a node with two inputs and one output, and uses moves, like crea and garb, to introduce generation moves instead, i.e., the move crea ( see the article by turing machines ). in http://turing machines.filesw gitorious.org/abstract.cfm?uri=opex-14-3-10-6. following this, in section [ fanoutmoves ] the algorithm makes use of moves from lambda calculus, namely the co - comm move and the co-comm move. in this paper i give a short description of these moves and of the algorithm. in particular, i explain the most important move, the graphical beta move. the move gives a precise definition of a fan - out gate in the global and in the local universe. for a longer description, i refer to the paper @xcite, where the algorithm is described in more detail. i want to express my thanks to alistair nicholas for his generous contribution of time and effort to the research in this area. i also thank jaume garriga for providing the beautiful and original contribution of his work, the first time in my life. i am grateful to many colleagues to the community for their observations and encouragement. finally, i would like to thank robert c. zachos for comments and
we bring together two sets of observational results recently obtained on the structure of pre - stellar dense cores and the first phases of protostellar collapse, which we use to elucidate the complexity of the process of star formation. we first discuss the dynamical evolution of cloud cores forming in the initial collapse phase, when the density profile of the core is relatively steep toward its edges ( i.e., @xmath0 ) but flatten out to near their centres. we then present analytical evidence that, after the hydrostatic core has fully formed, one enters the accretion phase, during which the mass of the central protostar is progressively removed from a surrounding infalling envelope while the infalling gas is arrested and thermalized in an accretion shock at the surface of the stellar core. this phase, which is characterized by a central density profile that is somewhat steeper than a singular isothermal sphere, corresponds to the ` self - initiated'collapse of the isolated cloud core. we model this evolution by means of a simple analytical model involving magnetic, turbulent, and turbulent pressures, and we interpret the results of our analysis of co(21 ) data around 36 class i sources and 9 class 0 sources as representing various stages in the evolution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) from class i to class 0 to the present - day main sequence phase. we argue that the decrease in outflow power which has been seen by batc during the embedded phase is a direct consequence of the non - virial equilibrium, believed to be due to progressively higher degrees of central concentration in the ambipolar diffusion - driven core - infall flow. we show that, in the sense the standard shu theory for core formation predicts the existence of ` isothermal protostars'( e.g., lada ( 1987 ). therefore, we postulate that the time taken from the critical to the singular state is relatively short in the models of mouschovias and co - workers for self - gravitating isothermal spheres. we also show that the most evolved ( class ii and class iii ) yso stages correspond to pre - main sequence stars surrounded by a circumstellar disk with optically thick and optically thin circumstellar disks, but without a dense circumstellar envelope. finally, we propose that the observed decrease in accretion power reflects a decrease in the mass accretion / infall rate which is consistent with the idea that accretion can not proceed without ejection and that outflows are directly powered by accretion.
the main idea of this paper is to look for obstructions to graph colorings in the following indirect way : take a graph, associate to it a topological space, study the algebraic invariants of this space, with the aim of eventually obtaining a proof of the lovsz conjecture, which states that if the graph has no loops, the set of all topological graphs is a compact polyhedron. the main tool in this investigation is the graph coloring, which is an assignment of colors to vertices such that no two vertices which are connected by an edge get the same color. we show that the vertex coloring of a graph @xmath0 with non - empty colors is the same as a graph homomorphism from @xik0 to @xigs1, a map that is known to be simple - homotopy equivalent. we prove that this is the only case for which it is possible to color a graph up to the chromatic number of its vertices. in a similar vein, we study the spectral properties of the corresponding stiefel - whitney complex, l. this is done by first defining the category of all loopfree graphs, followed by the class of all objects whose objects are loopfree, and then showing that this category is connected by a contravariant functor from the category. this leads to the proof that thechnology groups of the associated graphs are the proper homomorphisms from undirected graphs to the complete graph. in the same vein, the kneser conjecture from 1955 is discussed in detail. [ lothm ] the notion of simplicial complex has been around for a long time, and is the subject of intense interest in itself, as well as for its applications to geometry ( see, e.g., @xcite ). one of the most important results in the area is the hardness of constructing a polynomial scheme for the lattice groups of polyhedra on which a finite group acts freely. this problem has been considered in various papers over the last several decades, and the results were mostly obtained by using the graph theory or the graph theoretic tool of deriving the cohomology groups. the present paper is a different attempt at this goal. instead of making the construction explicit, we formulate the main results in a more general framework. the paper is organized as follows : in section 1, we provide the general framework of vertex coloring via the graph coloring. in section 2, we investigate the main difficulties of finding obstructions
we report the results of a deep, wide - area ( @xmath0 ) photometric and spectroscopic survey of the planetary nebula system of the local group spiral galaxy m33 ( ngc 598 ). the photometric data were obtained with the wiyn telescope interface array ( wiyn - da ) instrument on the 1.4 meter cable telescope at the european southern observatory ( eso ), and were taken with the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ). archival hst images were obtained at the johns hopkins telescope, kitt peak, national optical astronomy observatory, and university of california at berkeley and lawrence berkeley national laboratory, berkeley, ca 94720. our sample of planetary nebulae ( pne ) includes 168 sources spanning the range of h i from 900 to 4500. from their line - of - sight velocity dispersions, we estimate the stellar asymmetry of m33 s disk, and use the epicyclic approximation to model the galaxy s velocity ellipsoid. we also measure the system s vertical velocity gradient, and constrain the height of the disk. we use the data to derive a new distance modulus for m33, which is 0.30 mag less than that inferred from its cepheid period. the difference is not explained by our lack of data at faint magnitudes, and may be due to a combination of factors, including a decline in the ratio of disk to halo radii, a scale - length dependent stellar velocity dispersion, and a systematic gradient in the pnlf at small radii. finally, we examine the stellar kinematics of the galaxy, and find that there is no evidence for stellar population segregation inside the galaxy. in particular, we find that the mean oxygen abundance of pne is approximately twice solar, and that the rotation curve s h i rotation curve is well - reproduced by a model that includes a star - forming region with a bimodal luminosity function.
the generalized exponential log - squared ( gel - s ) distribution, which we call the _ right - skewed distribution _ ( rv ), is introduced for numerical analysis. it is one of the most flexible distributions that can be applied to a variety of data coming from different domains. the new distribution is parameter independent, but the form of the parameter does not generalize. its probability density function ( pdf ), for some @xmath0, has exponential decays at its both tails. the results of statistical properties as the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis are provided. the mode and quantile functions are also studied. the maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters of the distribution is proposed, but it still applies derivatives which still applies to derivatives with respect to other parameters. gaussian simulations conducted to assess the performance of the above - strategy for estimating parameters were performed. it was found that, for small samples, the parameters could not be recovered from the ( noisy ) underlying data. the lhpital rule applied to four well - known real data sets related to different domains showed that the( noisy ) data did not show a significant superiority over the other competing distributions. thus, the _ new distribution _ seems to be a promising model for representing light - tailed and right skewed data. = 1
we study the thermoelectric properties of a nanoscale size quantum dot exhibiting the kondo effect in terms of a single - electron anderson impurity model with two conduction electron leads and two leads. the single - channel anderson model is appropriate for quantum dots as it describes well the electronic properties of the anderson barrier in the strong correlation limit. by wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method, which is numerically exact and can take into account non - resonant effects, we calculate the static thermodynamic properties, as well as the transport properties ( thermopower, thermal conductivity, figure of merit ) of quantum dots and dilute magnetic impurities for several representative temperatures up to @xmath0. we find that the gate voltage ( local level ) dependence of the electrical and thermal conductance of quantum dot devices can be classified into two different behaviors depending on the relative value of the relative coupling strength between the leads. for a quantum dot with a constant density of states ( density of electrons per spin ) and a fixed chemical potential ( lead - to - lead ), the local level energy scales with the temperature according to the square of the ratio of the cross section of the conduction electrons in the leads to the temperature. at low temperatures, the electrical transport is mainly governed by the bandwidth of the leads, while at high temperatures, it is mainly determined by the spectral function of the quantum dot. however, at the high temperatures the two behavior of the local - level energy is completely different. in particular attention is paid to the role of the temperature - dependent gate voltage, by using the reduced density matrix ( fdm ) approach. the results of this paper are in good agreement with recent experimental observations, although a quantitative comparison to theory is still some way off.

we present the @xmath0 mass function ( bhmf ) of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and spheroids in early - type galaxies selected from the combo-17 survey. the bhmfs are calculated using local galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) at a fixed redshift and cosmological evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) parameters. an initial condition is assumed to have an equal value of smbh and spheroid luminosities. in the calculation, several factors are assumed : the aperture effect on the smbh luminosity, uncertainties in the estimated black hole masses and reddening, etc., which can give significant range of results.. the results are then compared with those obtained from agn lfs. it is noted that bhmfts from galaxy lfs are less accurate at high redshifts due to the limited number of well - defined fainter galaxies in the sample. the change in the redshift evolutions for the agn and the rv galaxies is also significant. we also investigate the effects of uncertainties and unconstrained parameters in this derivation. using hst / acs data, we find the rest - frame red sequence to be shifted along the normal sequence, which is commensurate with changing from elliptical to s0 galaxies. the red sequence is found to be significantly shifted towards higher redshits when the black hole mass is estimated. the possible implication of this feature is discussed. we further investigate the bhfs from morphologically selected early type galaxies, which are estimated from lfs at a similar redshift by i m et al. ( 2004 ). the relation between the luminosity of an exponential disk and the mass of a smbh is considered in this study. when luminosity is considered instead of mass, the ratio between the two estimated masses is closer to unity at a given redshift. we conclude that the ratio of a non - zero luminosity to a maximally rotating smbh can be used to constrain the scaling of the mass function towards massive galaxies.

we present intermediate - resolution long - slit spectra and narrow - band direct images of three objects classified in simbad as possible planetary nebulae : pm1 - 242, which are located in a region of the iras two colour diagram that is common to post - agb stars, pne, oh / ir stars and young stellar objects. the three objects have the same basic morphologies : high- and low - excitation emissions of [ neiii ], [ oi ] and [ nii ], and possibly [ sii ]. however, their true nature was not known. in this paper, we present intermediate resolution spectra obtained with the 2.2 m optical telescope of the calar alto centro m telescope ( caf ) and a narrow slit spectrograph ( sec ) on the palomar hale nebula observatory ( pah ), to investigate the true nature of these objects. after the detection of h@xmath0 emission, all three objects were classified as pne on the basis of their iras colours. the spectral properties, determined in the framework of this spectroscopic program, show that they are compact pne with a high - to - high excitation surface differential emission region and a polar structure embedded in the main body of the nebula. the emission from the two polar structures and the point - symmetric arcs forming the equatorial ring are characteristic of pne. the physical structures of the pne are slightly elliptical, with the major axis of the central object acting as a pivot point and the ring - like elongation along the north - south direction. the ellipse part of the ring shows faint, compact extended protrusions and an isolated knot at the east - west direction. for the two pne that no spectra were available, we reconstruct their physical structures using detailed interior kinematics. the innermost regions of the two brightest pne show the signatures of a bipolar and tilted equatorial shell. the pn physical structures then seem to be indicative of a double shell nature. the absence of sharp lines and elongated structures in the inner nebula, with respect to the central axis, suggests that the active regions are fainter and/or less evolved than the central regions.

we have studied the nlte formation problem of the fei, feii and oi lines in a 3d hydrodynamical model of the stellar atmosphere of the metal - poor star hd140283. this classical halo subgiant is widely used for studies of the origin of the chemical elements in the early galaxy. we have also carried out detailed radiative transfer calculations using a grid of ` classical'3d models of the star which have a good agreement with the observational data. in this paper we have focused on the oxygen abundance which can be obtained by fitting the observed disk centre profiles and equivalent widths of the oi ir triplet via spectral synthesis in the 3d model. to this end we have used the 33 fei and 15 feii lines for our 3d and 1d determinations of the iron abundance in the star. furthermore, we have made a detailed study of the effects of changes in the stellar parameters for the model assuming @xmath0 k and metallicities in the range [ fe / h]@xmath1. we show that the o i lines are the most reliable for both the iron and the oxygen abundances when 1d model effects are taken into account. as a result, the mean oxygen - to - iron ratio for the star is [ o / fe]=0.42 at [ iron / h ] = -0.56 dex, while the [ oi ] ratio is close to the unperturbed value ( 0.48 dex ) for a given effective temperature and a given gravitating mass. however, a small iron abundance error can be detected if we allow for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ), which is thought to be the case for the fe ii lines. on the other hand, a large iron error is expected if lte is also considered in addition to 3d effects ( e.g., asplund et al. 2002 ). our result suggests that the combination of 3d+nlte effects and those of 1d models can not be the ` ` best - choice '' for stars with the feii triplet in view of the current uncertainties in the known stellar parameters. in addition, we find that it is crucial that detailed detailed 2d+3d modeling of the solar photosphere is carried out in order to establish the reliability of the oxygen and iron abundance determinations in metal poor stars.
we present the results of a study of _ spitzer space telescope _ mips observations of luminous ( @xmath0 ) supernova remnants ( snrs ) and young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ). the spectra were obtained with the mips - sed mode of the spitzer telescope, using the sage - lmc 70-@xmath1 m point source catalog. we selected a sample of strong [ oi ] line emitters that cover a wide range in far - ir spectral type, from herbig ae / be stars to evolved stars and intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars. the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) spectra of the star - forming regions, mostly dominated by continuum emission, are used to characterize the interfaces between the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the dense cores of molecular clouds, where radiation and shocks from evolved stars, in snrs and agb stars, and warmer circumstellar dust. in general, continuum emission at higher frequencies is associated with cooler dust, but a clear bimodal distribution is present in the irs spectrum of one star, near the transition between warm and cool dust. the presence of cool dust around massive stars is consistent with the long - standing hypothesis that is a signature of the interaction interface of a snr with an adjacent molecular cloud, or of pre - main - sequence objects ( pdrs ) in earlier stages of evolution. the state of of the art in the lmc is characterized by high [ o / h ] and [ niii ] emission. we thus suggest that the bulk of the radiation is synchrotron - dominated, in contrast to the large majority of supernova explosions in the milky way. we also describe the appearance of the [ oiii ] line in several late - type snrs, and then in evolved objects, as well as in the dusty regions of the late phases of life within the smc. finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the character of the ism - star interaction, and the conditions for star formation, from the perspective of a global perspective.
in this paper we investigate the absorptance characteristics of lossless and lossy cut wires ( cws ) as wave absorbers in the context of metamaterial absorbers. cws are simple geometries which can be used to change the resonance positions and implement loss in the structure so that the absorption characteristics can be tailored for user needs. we demonstrate the possibility of highly customisable broadband absorption by using cws as waveabsorbers. when the symmetrically paired cw is used as a wave absorber, the maximum absorptivity of the pair of cws is increased by up to nearly ten % at operating frequency @xmath0 mm. furthermore, it is shown that the matching of the two types of resonances can be controlled by changing the frequency position, while the frequency of the electric resonance frequency is reduced, which can lead to a negative refractive index and a negative permeability. in addition, the geometrical asymmetry is used to design a simple unit unitary geometry so that homogenisation is possible in the absorber unit. 99 r.j. smith, d.c. eckardt, b.smith, m.stodolsky, a.a. cornell, w.r. tkach and w.s. lezec, ` ` a new approach to use lossless metal as a beam splitter, '' in _ proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america _, ( wiley - vch, 2008 ), pp. 8286. n.y. acad. sci., + eds., * 102 *, 210403 ( 2008 ). j.b. pendry, dong, s. fllinger, g.e. harris, r. miller, j. dongler, y. pikus, n.i. zheludev and y. s. kivshar,``nanophotonics for extreme magneto - optical applications '', phys. rev. lett. * 109 *, 033109 ( 2009 ). s.f. kim, z.m. voroshilov, alexander,@xmath1 i. research university press, dubna, russia, + e - mail : sunzhe@rad.ucl.ac.ru
we present the basic ideas and results of the theory of the darboux type transformations of the multidimensional quadrilateral lattice. these transformations generalize the integrable discrete analogues of the classical laplace transformations for two dimensional conjugate nets. we show that the fundamental transformation of the lattice can be decomposed either into the superposition of the lvy and adjoint lvy transformations, or into superpositions of two combescure and one radial transformations. as an implementation we introduce the two dimensional toda system. under the planarity constraint, the two - dimensional lattice is built out of the linear constraints and its forward and backward data are related through the @xmath0 function. the most important invariant feature of this construction is that it produces a new lattice from the backward data. in particular it gives a direct connection between the backward and the forward lam coefficients. nous tudions les proprits de laplace transformes de laquelles de theique dun corps quadraire. en effet, on trouve dans lunification dune tude uniforme sur le quations diffrentes, trouve lon peut tre choisi arbitrairement grand. de telles estimations ont de nombreuses grands nombres avec vitesse dans la littrature. on obtenemos un buen acuerdo entre la base de la base duale des oprateurs de la laplace. enfin, on associe chaque couple formule prsente plusieurs indices la dpendence de la cinmatique. les fonctions poids sont naturellement paramtrs par les darboles de la transformation darrive dans un milieu matemtrieux avec la base dune quations froids du module analytique. en prolongeant ceux conditions de sous le cas simple dune galement repose sur la cette structure, soit assez grande pour les quations doutrumpois ceux. dans le cas quune thorie extrmale, la darbole par les deux grands paramtres, laplace sont des varits de dimension quelle encore un quune filosofie au cnrs lisomorphisme de dimension six. ceci amne raliser que les conditions paramtriques permettent de contr
we present the discovery of subpulse drifting behaviour of the wide profile pulsar psr b0818@xmath041, observed at multiple frequencies with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) in full polar mode. this pulsar shows a remarkable simultaneous occurrence of three distinct drift regions : an inner region with flatter apparent drift rate flanked on each side by a surrounding outer region with a deeper inner region showing a significantly steeper evident drift rate. the coinciding inner and outer drift regions always maintain a phase locked relationship ( plr ), which is interpreted as being due to the intersection of the inner ring with two conal rings on the polar cap of a fairly aligned rotator. the outer ring shows uncommon subpulse behaviour, i.e., subpulses appear at progressively changing longitude in the pulse profile following a particular path ( known as drift band ) which is specific to the pulsar concerned. we also report a significant linear polarization without any signature of changing handedness at 325, 610 and 1060 mhz. in addition to the remarkable subpulse drift at 325 mhz, we present the average profiles at five different frequencies from 325 to 610 mhz which show that the average pulse profile evolves remarkably with frequency. the average polarization profiles are consistent with the observed orthogonal polarization mode jump at the edges of the profile. high frequency turn - over of a modest amount of linear polarization ( 32 % at 660 mhz and 31 % at 1440 mhz ) is observed only in the leading and trailing outer ring and not in the inner region. though it is known that the drift bands are strongly correlated, we find a non - monotonically changing drift rate at both in the outer and inner ring and often change its drift rate with the pulse number. many transitions of drift rates, including aliasing, aliasing and stationary transitions, are observed for the inner drift band and some of these transitions can be understood by the slight aliasing due to partial phase change of the polar viewing geometry. + our findings provide new insights into the emission processes in the magnetosphere of pulsars, and help us understand the puzzling nature of pulsar emission mechanism.

the discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of standard models for the lithium abundances in halo stars has arisen in the context of the standard model treatment of rotational mixing. although models with microscopic diffusion are required to reproduce the solar rotation rate at the age of the sun, standard models and the previous generation of models for stars have predicted initial li abundances that differ by up to a factor of ten from the same set of current data in open clusters. to investigate this discrepancy, we have constructed stellar models with rotation that are calibrated on the rotation rates observed in young open clusters for stars younger than @xmath0 2 myr. with an improved treatment of angular momentum evolution in low mass stars, these models now allow us to place strong constraints on the surface rotation rates as a function of mass and age, and the distribution of initial rotation velocities can be inferred. in particular, the observed dispersion in the surface li abundance can be used to place an upper limit on the amount of li which is 0.2 - 0.4 dex lower than that predicted by standard models. we have also combined the halo star and open cluster data to study the variation of lithium depletion with age and metallicity. we find that the observed trend for li depletion with increasing age is consistent with a range of small but realizations of the possible li depletion factors which are produced by a combination of small initial li depletions and a steepening of the surface lithium distribution. these lithium depletion factors can be measured using observations of the [ li]-@xmath1 relationship in stars with ages similar to those in the pleiades, sgrs, and we show that some of the scatter in the reported trends in this relationship may be due to uncertainties in the input physics. the simultaneous detection of li and li in one halo must have been triggered by a process including both rotation and mild envelope mixing, and seems to confirm that small li depletion is a promising candidate for explaining the data. our models also show that the data are consistent with nonstandard initial rotation rates when the effects of gravitational energy dissipation are taken into account. lithium depletion, rotation rate, initial li depletion, primordial abundances, cosmic rotation, cosmology
we show that every @xmath0-periodic triangulated surface origami is constructible from a base origami by a sequence of periodic joint - splitting moves. the number of incident bars is algebraically independent at the level of the quotient graph. we discuss the relationship of the origami polynomial to the real - valued determinant and to the existence and persistence of modes under small periodic perturbation. the theory of periodic bar - joint structure, a strand of research in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, has proved to be a successful framework for the analysis of topological insulators and other topological objects. experiments in three dimensions have shown that the theory is capable of predicting in an exact way the periodic structure of a material, in the sense that it is stable under small perturbations. the most prominent example of such experiments is the generation of _ phonon modes _ which are experimentally observed in the discretisation of the bohr spectra of almost periodic infinitesimal flexes @xcite. the first of these experiments was performed on a thin planar surface and it is a well - known fact that the zero - energy modes of the torus x is a pendant of the universal vibrational line. the aim of the paper is to develop a method for the determination of the modes of torus surfaces which is independent of the geometric parameters of the surface and which may be relevant in the construction of periodic thin - film origami. we shall focus on the case when the surface is a periodic triangulation of a flat surface, for the sake of brevity and as such we do not consider a detailed analysis of the mode determinant. the theorem of rum ( 1997 ) states that every diagonally symmetric phonon mode field which is locally decidable is locally finite. this means that if the mode is present at most on one of the edges of a torus and its neighbourhood is compact then it is locally uncoloured. incidentally, this theorem does not apply to discretised modes which are present on the full torus surface or to modes that are only marginally confined to certain subspaces, as may occur in the case of strongly correlated materials. the paper provides a complete and general description of the theorem and provides an independent proof for the first time. the proof relies on the concept of _ face diagrams _ which give the ( non - trivial ) incidence of faces of the joints in the motif of interest. face diagrams also give a planar depiction of the
we present a study of a variety of fluid binary mixtures, with particular emphasis on mixtures of alkanes in supercritical carbon dioxide and benzene. using a simple lennard - jones model for interaction parameters of pure apolar fluids, monte carlo calculations in the grand - canonical ensemble, analyzed by appropriate finite size scaling methods, readily yield rather satisfactory predictions in agreement with experiments. we use interactions parameters that are tuned such that the critical point ( critical temperature, critical density or pressure ) of the pure systems are well reproduced. the generality of the approach and the level of accuracy for the pure components allows us to search for parameter regimes where discrepancies ( i.e. not accounted for in previous calculations ) can not be avoided. in particular, we present results for the mixture of argon plus co@xmath0, a mixture of an apolar and a quadrupolar fluid, for which ( apart from some region of the phase diagram near criticality ) the model is able to predict with good accuracy the phase behavior of the mixture. we also investigate mixtures with apolar solvents including noble gases and methane. we investigate the accuracy of the use of the lorentz - berthelot ( lb ) combining rules, which was required in previous work to obtain such an accurate phase diagram. using our coarse grained ( cg ) model, we avoid the need for a big violation of the lb combining rules in the cases where discrepancies are known to occur. although the scheme presented in this work is not perfect, we demonstrate that excellent agreement is achieved in the critical region and along the entire phase diagram, as opposed to a lot of poorer agreement with the experiments. in the same spirit, we also present results of an analytical equation of state ( eos ) study, which we believe will be useful for potential applications with mixed substances. t. antognini _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 96 *, 138302 ( 2009 ) ] ( u.s.a., new york oxford university press, 2006 ).
* purpose : * to improve the predictive power of computer - aided diagnosis ( cad ) for pulmonary embolism ( pe ). current clinical guidelines suggest to perform a first - level, clinical stratification based upon patient s history, clinical findings and, in some cases, physician s judgment. for this purpose, several clinical prediction rulers ( cpr ) have been developed to assist physicians with the implementation of a cad system. + * methods : * in this study a multidimensional, topological data analysis was applied to a cohort of 1500 patients accepted in the department of intensive and subintesive medicine at _ ospedali riuniti di ancona _, a total of 987 patients of average 70 years were included. the inclusion criteria for this study were that the patients at least were recorded with wells score, revised geneva score, d - dimer and blood gas @xmath0 and that the trials were designed to assess the performance of a three - layer, artificial neural network ( an ann ) trained to perform the clinical task. the analysed dataset allowed us to increase the clinical performance of the system by training the network to recognize different subgroups of patients and features, thereby decreasing the need for further diagnostic radiological imaging. the backpropagation algorithm for the system has been shown to perform well. * results : * the features selection strategy was beneficial in the sense that the system generated more features than what could be observed in the presence of the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks test ). besides this, the ayasdi - iris algorithm was used to generate the network using features acquired from the iris dataset. the results show that the combination of a strong feature selection strategy and a bottom - up design for the network can lead to a better treatment of pe in patients. * conclusion : * our study shows that a rigorous training of an ann on the input of a medical dataset is necessary to effectively create a predictive power law, and it is useful to compare such trained networks with other classification systems.
we present predictions on the production of charmed hadrons in p+p and a+a collisions, based on a phenomenological model of the coalescence of baryons. the model is based on the transport model of ultra - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( urqmd ) and it already includes all the known baryonic resonances. we calculate the inelastic cross section of charm production in central au+au collisions as a function of the collision energy and we show that it can be used to predict the yields of charm - like nuclei and hypernuclei with reasonable accuracy. we find that at the beam energy range expected for heavy ion collisions at the sis100 accelerator, @xmath0 can be produced at a significant rate, in a wide range of intermediate mass nuclear clusters, up to a mass of 3 - 4 nanobarns. if we assume that the charm is created in the charm cluster with the mass of the nucleon and the binding energy of the cluster is around 2.0@xmath1 mev, at a fixed target beam energy of 50 a gev, we predict a total yield of charm particles per nucleon. the total yield can be further enhanced by several orders of magnitude if the string contribution to the total cross section is decreased. for the highest available beam energy at the time dependent beam energy the production cross section could be enhanced by a factor of 2 - 3. the results are in good agreement with data from the cbm experiment. we also discuss the effect of possible effects of chiral symmetry restoration, of the restored hadron symmetry and different nuclear binding energies. the considered energy range could be extended to higher beam energies, in order to study more charm production processes in nuclear collisions. the possibility to detect charmed nuclei would open a new window, in the search for bound nuclear states with charm, and to address the long standing problem of the lack of data on this class of particles.
we consider automata which describe the subgroups of a finite rank free group of rank @xmath0, acting on an i - step expansion of a free group. automata are edge - labeled directed graphs which map a path in the free group towards a given automaton. we provide a description of the well - known algorithm to construct such automata for a given finitely generated subgroup using whitehead automorphisms. we also describe a generalization of this algorithm which achieves exponential cardinality ( in terms of the cost ) for sequences of non - negative integers, and provides a necessary condition for the automaton to be semisimple, i.e., to be ` ` dual ''. the notion of automata was introduced by whitehead @xcite, motivated by questions arising from the study of how to treat the relationship between the _ gaussimal complexity _ of finite - rank free groups and the ` ` computational complexity '' of approximation algorithms ( see, e.g., m. boileau and m. e. harris 2011 ). essentially, this is a characterization of the computational complexity of approximate linear automata. more precisely, _ implicit _ or explicit _, a _ semilinear _ automaton is an automaton which describes the functional dependence of certain structural properties of finite groups on _ computational complexity _, that is, the ability to factorize a problem into a subproblem which can be solved exactly. the first to analyze this approach were whitehead ( *??? * remark 5.4 ). for this purpose, we describe two techniques which we will review in more detail in section [ sec. 1. in the first section, we define automata and the above - mentioned methods for constructing them. the second section is devoted to a different approach towards automata, and we discuss the results obtained by monte carlo simulation of the reduction of sequences of i - steps in the combinatorics of reduced word - groups. this approach, which we call _ dual automaton _, is of a particular interest, in the sense that it provides an explicit algorithm for automata - or at least, an explicit bijection - based on a notion of ` ` free groups '' ( see section [ prop unique ] ).
we use the swift numerical integrator to investigate the orbital evolution of test particles launched from the tethys coorbital satellites telesto and calypso. the initial state vector for the saturn system is from r. jacobson ( sat263 model ), while all other satellites are in a 4:2 mixed - inclination - type mean - motion orbit with mimas, helene, and polydeuces, except for methone and the coorbitals, for which the values of @xmath0 are all consistent with zero. particles do not need to achieve full escape speed to go into orbit about saturn, though ; the launch speed is clearly limited by the requirement that sufficient mass is present on the satellite s equator to prevent the lowest velocity ejecta from escaping the source moon. in the first numerical experiment, we systematically investigated the fates of ejecta launched from their equatorial regions. here we focus on emission from small trojan moons, as well as tadpole and horseshoe orbits. our results show a surprising degree of asymmetry in this study, as indicated by the regimes which correspond to tadpoles, horseshoes, and puppets being ejected and staying there for 100,000 years. in shedding light on this apparent asymmetry, we describe in detail the tests of ( i ) youthfulness ( in a sense of reduced size ) and ( ii ) eccentricity - strength ( in contrast to e.g. saturn ) that led to the interesting results in this paper. address = department of physics, university of washington, box 351580, seattle, wa 98195, usa address = max - planck - institute for astronomy, knigsstuhl 17, 69117 heidelberg, germany address = dpmc, universitt stuttgart, pfaffenwaldring 57/iii, bundesstrae 1, 85741 garching bei maryland address = icrf, nasa s goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 20770 address = centre de recherche astrophysique de lyon, cea / dsm / spht, cnrs, universit paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex, france address = harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics, 60 garden st., baltimore, md 21218 address = laboratoire de physique thorique, p.o.
we discuss the colors of extremely faint galaxies obtained from combining extremely deep @xmath0-band imaging, obtained with the keck telescope, with near infrared near - infrared imaging of these objects. the optical data are from the w. m. keck 10-m telescope, near infrared camera ( nirc ), and the new technology telescope ( ntt ). the limiting magnitudes of galaxies in the images are 27 mag arcsec@xmath6 at 3@xesmath7 in @xcite. the typical seeing in the data is better than 0.1 arcsec and the data are particularly good at the faint magnitudes reached with the ntt. we refer to these objects as the ` red outlier'galaxies. similar outlier objects have turned up in all deep optical / near infrared surveys. from the surface density of the red outliers, we find that their reddening is substantial, and that the fraction of galaxies with colors significantly redder than the average is more than 70 %. we determine the optical and near infrared colors of the objects, and use the combined color - magnitude and color - color diagrams to compare the data with galactic evolution models. most of the galaxies in this sample have colors that are consistent with a population drawn from a variety of redshifts and galaxy types, though there are a few that clearly show the presence of very red colors. we explore several different models for the reddening of these galaxies, including second - burst elliptical models, dwarf spheroidal models, and a qualitative scenario involving dust. the most viable model is an isochrone synthesis galaxy evolution track with a star formation rate increasing with redshift. models without dust reveal a dusty, early - type galaxy population that is well mixed with the later - type population, except perhaps in some cases for very red galaxies. we note that models with very low metallicity and high star formation rates can not reproduce the observed color - luminosity ratios, unless they have a substantial amount of reddening and/or are viewed at very faint angles. models with such a population are likely to be very old, and it is plausible that the redoutlier galaxies are part of this population. we discuss the implications of the data for cosmological models of galaxy evolution, including the pure k - correction.
we have made a detailed analysis of the optical spectra of the layered and molecular solid ( mf ) using the second - order perturbative non - local correction method in order to investigate the nature of chemical bonding and the elastic properties of the investigated compound. without inclusion of so interactions, the calculated energy band gap values of both sf and mf are in good agreement with experimental data implying that there exists a nearly perfect linear molecular structure of mf in its rest - frame. on the other hand, we observed an anisotropic behavior of the elastic constants such as the anisotropy parameter, sound wave velocity, and debye temperature under the compressibility of orthorhombic lattice constants a, b, c, and d. this can be interpreted as the evidence that the so interactions play a significant role for mf. the calculated stress parameter a(hg@xmath0/n ) shows significant increase whereas b(n)is relatively weaker as a function of pressure. increase of lattice constant b under hydrostatic pressure brings sf closer to the experimental value suggesting that mf possesses the more compressible intermolecular interactions along c - axis. the pressure sensitive constant a of sf is 0.42 ev which is much higher than the value of 0.09 ev found in mf.the total and partial number density of states pdos reveals that sf possesses higher @xmath1-density of states at the fermi level whereas mf does not. thus, the experimental observations provide solid theoretical grounds to discriminate the two novelties of this compound over the vast range of pressures. further, we also observed that the shape of the pdos is more prominent in sf due to the presence of so much more tightly bound states which suggests that the system is more fundamentally embedded in three - dimensional superlattices than in the single - molecule ground state. the significance of light - binding interaction ( so ) is also discussed by calculating the phonon dispersion tensor of an electron in an electric field.
we use a dense suite of high - resolution numerical simulations to study the evolution of the primordial gas fraction, @xmath0, in turbulent flows over a wide range of flow mach numbers and pollutant conditions in early - type galaxies. the simulations cover the range of turbulence and pollution conditions relevant for primordial star formation, from sub - millimeter to millimeter scales. we develop a new general framework for the modeling of the mixing of interstellar gas in supersonic turbulence, which is applicable to any physical problem in which the unresolved, unmixed fraction needs to be tracked throughout the simulation. under the assumption that supernova driven turbulence is the primary source of energy for mixing in the early universe, and that the molecular diffusivity term in the perturbative hydrodynamic equation for turbulent mixing is small compared to the viscous one, we adopt a point source approximation for the turbulent mixing, and use a density fluctuation - based approach for the computation of the concentration distribution function ( pdf ). using several closure models from the literature, we test the predictions of our theoretical models against simulation data for scalar fields in the turbulent regime, and show how they can be used to construct subgrid models for computationally - efficient computations of the pristine gas fraction. as a results, we find that a class of pdf closure models, called self - convolution models, provides good fits to the simulation results at all levels of turbulent driving force, and at all mach numbers. we also find that the slope of the synthetic mixing curves follow a similar trend as the corresponding pdf curves, namely, a flatter slope. this result suggests that the time at which the generalized convolution phase starts to start has some dependence on whether the pristine or polluted fraction is larger or smaller than the critical value defined by the average of the local density of these elements. in the case of the highest - density cases, i.e., cases 1b and 1c, the generalized, stochastic correction to the pristine fraction falls much faster with increasing flow mach number, in comparison with the prediction of the poisson approximation. we show how our simulation results can be applied to construct one - zone models for the well - characterized transition from pop iii to pop ii star formation in early galaxies. our results also provide an explanation for the scale - dependence of the smooth mixing timescale found by de avillez and mac low ( 2002 ) in a suite of numerical simulations of mixing in supernova - driven interstellar turbulence.
we present an analysis of the clump population of macs j1149, a nearby spiral galaxy at redshift @xmath0. the galaxy is located behind the galaxy cluster, and thanks to the achieved resolution achieved by the gravitational lensing campaign, clumps can be studied in detail down to scales of a few kpc. we find a prominent population of roughly 30 clumps, for which we derived ages, masses, extinctions, and effective radii. to compare with local star - forming regions, we have collected literature data of cluster complexes with properties similar to those of the clusters in luminous blue compact galaxies and some of the most massive studied intermediate age star forming galaxies. the masses and luminosities of these complexes are typically a factor of 10 larger than those of typical cluster complexes in local spirals and comparable to complexes in ngc6946. in our imaging simulation of local galaxies at the distance and resolution of sp1149 we observed that the cluster complexes are distributed along the bright h@xmath1 regions, i.e. they have recently formed. the morphological detail of the single complexes are erased, and we do nt see any major difference between them and the young clumps in the local universe. the star formation history of the galaxy can be modeled by looking at three different star formation histories ( sfhs ), all of which are constrained by this dataset. the main result of our analysis is that the underlying physical process which governs star formation in these galaxies, and the physical conditions responsible for their formation, follow the same detailed mass - size relation introduced in the milky way ( gmcs ). we also find that the clumps are well mixed with the older embedded cluster complexes found in nearby galaxies, suggesting that the transition phase between the formation of massive, high - velocity clumps and the formation in low - mass, low - velocity ones is already integrated in the present dataset. using the scaling laws given by micutt and mcclintock we are able to reproduce the observed trend of increasing gas surface density and continuous star formation rate ( sfr ) with increasing radius from the centre of the system.

we present a survey for molecular outflows towards the perseus molecular cloud, using our @xmath0h@xmath1 datasets and data presented here for the first time towards ngc1333, one of the most active regions of star formation in the local group. this survey is part of a larger program to look for statistical variations in the kinematics of molecular gas in star - forming regions, in particular in the context of a molecular outflow evolutionary scenario proposed by @xcite. the survey extends our previous work on ( sub)millimetre continuum maps, which we have used to estimate the outflow driving mechanism ( jet - driven or wide - angle outflows ). in this paper we describe the data analysis and the processing of our dataset, which complements existing in - plane kinematic data. we look for outflows associated with candidate star forming cores in the four regions of active star - formation in our fields. each of the four fields in our survey is covered by a fourier map of outflow velocity and we investigate the corresponding core classifications based on their spectral energy distributions ( seds ). we find no evidence for differences in outflow classification between the four clusters, although we do find evidence for a possible core - to - core difference in the maximum outflow seds. we define a ` basket'class for high - density and low - density outflows which we associate with either a single starless or a two - component wind. we identify with a single core. our data are sensitive enough to detect outflows within the 4pc region in each core and to distinguish between starless and protostellar sources. we determine the density of the outflows and the maximum ( in baryon density ) and find that the majority of the detected outflows are starless, with a small fraction of them showing significant core contamination. we also find strong evidence for evolution in the seds of both the highest density and most massive outflows. we interpret our results in terms of a correlation between the driving mechanism and the age of the parent protostar, with older sources having slower mass loss and longer lifetimes than younger sources.

we investigate the string correlations and their extreme values in infinite - size spin-1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains with antisymmetric exchange interaction in the infinite matrix product state ( imps ) representation for the ground state wavefunction of the infinite lattice system. the groundstate wavefunction is obtained numerically by using the infinite time evolving block decimation method within the imps representation. to do this, we employ the @xmath0-body finite - entanglement scaling method that has been recently developed for the simulation of quantum phase transitions. in this study, we focus on the characterization of the string order and the non - local behaviors of spin - spin correlations ( i.e., string correlations ) in various infinite spin lattice systems with an arbitrary anisotropic interaction strength. it is shown that the string correlation groundstate shows a unique behavior of decaying to zero within a finite correlation length with respect to the an infinite - lattice distance in the xy phase ( tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase ), which corresponds to a quantum many - body state in the transition from the von neumann entropy and the fidelity per lattice site ( fls ) point. in addition, the haldane phase is also considered as a disordered phase. we discuss the behaviors of string correlations as a function of the anisotropy parameter, thereby demonstrating that their singular behaviors are unique and distinct from those of the other phases. then, we introduce a new phase diagram for the spin chains, which shows a cross - over from the y- to y- or y-@xmath1-type behavior for large lattices. a phase diagram is also introduced to elucidate the different universality classes of the transition points. to show that the transverse magnetic field effects are crucial to characterize different one - dimensional quantum phases in infinite spin systems, we consider the infinite spin- 1 xxz chain model in an external magnetic field. under the assumption that the exchange interaction plays no role in determining the order parameters characterizing the xxz phase, we find a single - nodal string correlation in the system and show that its extreme value can be determined directly from the long - range string order. also, we calculate the center - of - mass correlation length and the chiral fraction within the infinite chain.
we investigate the effect of environment on the evolution of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and the star formation process in the barred spiral galaxy, m83. we used three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the _ enzo _ adaptive mesh refinement code to resolve the turbulent clumpiness of the interstellar medium in the galaxy and investigate the dependence of their properties on the global structure of the galactic potential. the simulations reproduce the observed global characteristics of the gas and stellar distribution down to a limiting resolution of 1.5pc in the spiral arms and down to 0.3mpc in the inter - arm region. star formation was modelled on the observed star formation rate surface density, using rates given by @xcite. in agreement with previous studies, we find that clouds in the arms and spiral arms form quasi - spherical spurs due to shearing flows and shocks driven by spiral structures. the amount of shearing depends on the local gas surface density. unstable regions in the disc can self - assemble into several clouds, while stable regions can be torn apart into dense clumps. we observe a bimodal population of clouds between 20 - 40pc from the disc - end. compared to the galaxy as a whole, the outer disc has a higher fraction of low surface density clouds ( @xmath0 ), an ` ` as yet undetected '', low velocity dispersion cloud population, and a tail extending to the edge of the bar region. we also find that cloud properties change significantly as a function of radius in the three environments. the bar - end of the disc in m83 is the most rapidly rotating, leading to a higher ratio of inner to outer spiral arms. this trend is similar to that seen in other spiral galaxies such as m51 and ngc 4303. the ratio between the velocity dispersions of the clouds relative to the stellar potential is low in the two environments, a result which is consistent with recent x - ray observations. we conclude that clouds form in spiral galaxies because of their interaction with the galaxy s large - scale structure and that star formation is an ongoing process.

we develop a semi - analytical method to study the effects of photoionization on the temperature - density relation at the low density regime. the method is based on considering the density evolution of a set of fluid elements in a photoionized intergalactic medium with initial parameters drawn from a distribution implied by whatever cosmological initial conditions one prefers. given a probability distribution of the initial configuration for these elements, one can generate a whole set of such elements and simply follow their thermal and chemical evolution. the evolution of each fluid element is determined by the zeldovich approximation, which is known to be a good approximation in the mildly nonlinear regime. we apply our method to models in which the reionization epoch and the amplitude of the ionizing radiation vary with time, allowing the onset epoch ( as well as its spectrum and amplitude ) and the cosmology to vary. the resulting mean temperature at all densities represented by our method is a power law with a slope @xmath0 $ ]. the slope is well - approximated by an exponential law, with the best fit given by a power - law of the power law index @xcite. the results we obtain are compared with those obtained from hydrodynamic simulations. in particular, our method gives excellent fits to the temperature profiles of hu et al. ( 1996 ) and to the ly@xmath1 forest data in terms of the temperature and density of neutral hydrogen as a function of frequency. we use our results to address the following questions : what are the implications for the observational properties of the lyman - alpha forest and the intra - galactic medium after the onset of ionization? how does the ultraviolet radiation intensity compare with the specific density of reionized hydrogen? to what extent can ionization affect the column density distribution of hydrogen? from these studies, we draw the following conclusions. first, it is shown that if the mean temperature of hydrogen is constant, then the bolometric column density of hydrogen increases monotonically with time ; if the density is varied, the ratio of hydrogen density to hydrogen density reaches an asymptotic maximum and then declines rapidly to some minimum value, reflecting the equilibrium conditions that prevail in the early universe when the inhomogeneities in density and temperature are both much smaller than the average. second, even if the redshifted hydrogen column density is equal to the critical value ( the ` ` critical value '' ) as in the models with constant density, if the rest of hydrogen remains as a highly fluctuating, unperturbed inter
we present the results of long - term hydrodynamic simulations of axisymmetric, relativistic jets, made of a pure leptonic or baryonic plasma, propagating into a uniform environment. the simulations extend up to an evolutionary age of @xmath0y. in all models two evolutionary epochs can be distinguished. during the first epoch the mach disk is only slightly disturbed, the shedding of vortices is negligible, and both the hotspot pressure and the jet velocity are nearly constant. the size and shape of the cocoon depend on the ratio of the densities in the jet and in the ambient medium. after this initial stage the jets decelerate progressively. the velocity increase during the acceleration phases can exceed 100 %. the fact that jets with finite initial opening angles are self - gravitating and that the flow becomes approximately self - similar at large times suggests that these cocoons are the result of the inflation of a very thin cocoon. in the second epoch the jets become dominated by a strong equipartition magnetic field and are elongated ( on sub - parsec scales ). the aspect ratio increases with time, while the average cavity pressure decreases. the jet morphology and the dynamics are almost independent of the assumed composition of the jets. except for a very light jet, which is highly polarised, all models reproduce the observed sizes and deceleration of powerful radio sources. a hot jet is always more extended than a cold jet. in models lh and lc, which are the most polarised of the models, the cocoons in the jets are extended and evolve with a relatively high aspect ratio, similar to that observed for powerful mm - sars. this evolution is attributed to the influence of the magnetic field provided that the initial conditions chosen for the simulations are very extreme. the main disadvantage of the model lh is that its density is much lower than that of the other two in which the plasma is damped thermally. the effect of the composition on the dynamics and morphology of jets is large and is often masked by large differences between models. our results demonstrate that the two - flow model is stable against the excitation of electrostatic waves, provided the minimum energy cut - off of the electron - positron plasma is very large. c i u # 1 # 1#1
considering systems composed of spin-@xmath0 objects, we derive the optimal parameters ( obps ) for the bell test on such systems. we show that obps are crucial to reveal nonlocality, give the maximum value of the bell function for a class of states which includes both bell states and werner states, and present an unexpected behavior in the dependence of the obps on the initial mixedness and degree of entanglement. consider a system of two identical qubits, each embedded in a zero - temperature bosonic environment. the dynamics of the single part ` ` qubit - environment '' is described, in the case of bosonic reservoirs under rotating wave and dipole approximations, by the hamiltonian @xcite. the two - qubit density matrix @xmath1, in correspondence with the two regions of the quantum dynamics, is then obtained by a procedure that depends only on their initial values and on the environment structure. it is found that ( i ) under a standard computational setup, the initial x structure is maintained during the evolution, by a mechanism different from that of a bosonic reservoir, and ( ii ) there is a gap between the pure and mixed states, when the appropriate settings are adopted. the problem of finding the optimal obps has thus received a complete answer in the context of solid - state physics with josephson phase qubits. this work provides a detailed analysis and new insights into the problem. address = max - planck - institut fr physik, heisenbergstrae 1, d-70569 heidelberg, germany address = jagiellonian university, baltimore, md 21250, usa, altaddress = department of physics and astronomy, university of tennessee, knoxville, tn 37996 - 1200 ( usa ) address = nasa goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md 20771 + usa
the current standard model of the universe is the friedmann - walker expanding universe. however, because of the universal occurrence of wave phenomena in physics and the consistency of the paradigm with the basic laws of physics, some of the old problems of physics such as the origin of the hubble redshift and the requirements for the symmetry of the laws of nature need to be taken into account. therefore, a new paradigm that is alternative to the expanding universe model is proposed. this new paradigm, called the _ static universe hypothesis _, is based on the introduction of a new physical principle, the perfect cosmological principle, which was proposed in 1948 by bondi and gold. the Petersen and hoyle believed the universe must be expanding and thermodynamically in a non - equilibrium state. because the wave modes have very small amplitudes, the perturbed frequency is approximated by approximating a single particle. today, with the launch of the ground - based telescopes, the observations of the galaxies on a large scale are much more consistent with the static model than the expanding model. the observations show that the galaxies are homogeneously and isotropically distributed, they are smaller and their distribution is isotropic, i.e., they form a perfect family of particles. thus, the hypothesis of a static universe in an equilibrium state follows directly from the pcp. the model is compared to the observations using four different global tests of the space - time metric. the best agreement between the observations and the models is achieved with the model for the cosmic microwave background radiation. furthermore, this model predicts an average galaxy mass which is in the range 5@xmath0, which is very close to the values from the observed surface brightnesses of elliptical galaxies. + _ keywords _ : cosmology, universe, observations, theory, theory + _ pacs numbers : 98.80.es, 04.62.+k, 95.35.+r, 98.70.+z
we investigate the joint design of the joint channel partition regions of a narrowband spectrum sharing model where an unlicensed / secondary user ( su ) is allowed to transmit over a frequency band originally licensed to a primary user ( pu ). in the underlay system, the su can transmit even when the pu is present, but the transmitted power of su should be controlled properly so as to ensure that the resulting interference does not degrade the received signal quality of pu to an undesirable level. we assume that the channel information from the su - transmitter ( su - tx ) to the pu - rx channel ( denoted by power gain @xmath0 ) and the corresponding average interference power ( aip ) constraint are jointly quantized. this channel partitioning problem is solved offline at a central controller called the cognitive radio ( cr ) network manager. we show that the power level for the last region approaches zero, allowing us to derive a useful low - complexity suboptimal quantized power allocation algorithm called zpiora for high rate quantization. we also derive explicit properties related to the channel quantizer structure as the number of feedback bits goes to infinity, including non - asymptotic behavior of the su outage probability with high resolution quantization, and full channel state information ( csi ) deficiency. with only six bits of feedback, the designed optimal algorithms provide secondary outage probability very close to that achieved by full csi. optimal power allocation for multi - base station system under an average transmit power ( atp ) constraint and an average interference constraint is also presented and discussed. pacs number(s ) : 89.20.ff, 89.75.+b, 92.60.cq. keywords : cognitive radio, spectrum sharing, power allocation, network manager, full channel information.

we describe a possible solution to the problem of neutrino oscillation in field theoretical models which still assume that neutrinos are produced and detected locally. we do this by means of a full quantum field theoretical description of the interaction process between a source and a detector, where the source is represented as a wave packet and the detector as a single particle. in particular, we consider the decoherence time ( @xmath0 ) between the decayed and the undecayed state of the source, after which the neut -ino is emitted ( source collapsed to decayed state ), and propagates for a certain time ( neutroabsorption time ). depending on the wave packet distribution, the oscillation output is then traced out in a convenient basis ( momentum basis ). we use a planewave formulation of the interactions, in which the source - detector interaction is mediated by wave packets of the kind that have been proposed by pontecorvo [ phys. rev. lett. * 106 *, 109 ( 1985 ) ]. in this model, the source and detector wave packets are assumed to be given by the same wave packet arrangement as the one describing thedecoherence process, with the exception that the latter is given by a different one for wave packets which may have different sizes. thus, it is shown that there is a complete conflict between unitary and causality in the probabilities obtained in such treatments. this will serve as a motivation for the development of a model free from such ambiguities, and leads to a more rigorous derivation of the neutry oscillation probability formula, which is to make direct connections with experiments, thus yielding a more extensive criteria for the inclusion of experiments, and a determination of the unitary probability in the derivation. # 1#2#1|#2 | # 2 # 1| # 2 = cmss10 scaled 1 = cmr10 scaled1 = cmbx9 at 10pt = cmti9 at 7.5pt # 1 # 1/#1 /#1#1 - 6pt/ 51.8pc.8ex @=11 caption#1[#1]#2 @=12.7ex gev mev ev kev tev m_z m_pl _ fcnc number of pages : + number of tables : [ # 1 ] # 1 footnote omitted.5ex
we report on the discovery of the extremely bright ( @xmath0 ), high - redshift(@xmath1 ), ultra - violet ( uv/14000 ), bright ( e(hii )=303.8 ), narrow absorption by hei304(1400 ) at 1160 in the hamburg / eso survey for bright qsos and on successful observations of heii304 absorption with the green bank telescope ( ghrs ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ). the hst observations were carried out in three bands between june 7 and june 14, 1996, in parallel with observations with the ground - based facilities ( lagrange and caspec ) at the eso 2.2 m telescope and at the galex at eso 3.6 m telescope. in the first and second bands the qso was detected with a flux above the threshold flux for emission by the heii 304 forest and in the third band neither line was detected. from the analysis of the low resolution ( 3500 ) optical spectrum we find that the optical depth of the associated system is close to the maximum flux allowed by the ghrs and is consistent with the depth at which the expected heii line emission is expected to appear. we have detected heii absorption in the deep ` ` voids '' in the high - resolution optical spectrum of qso 2.0894@xcite, in agreement with the predictions of photoionization calculations using the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) effect. however, the diffuse component is much weaker than expected, and can not be satisfactorily modelled by a single set of parameters. if the voids are caused by additional ionizing sources ( e.g. agn or seyfert galaxies ), the mean heii opacity must be much lower, as expected, than in the case of the bright qso q0302@xday0003. consequently, the igm is likely to be highly ionized and/or contains a much lower fraction of the baryons than expected. we propose here that we observe a patchy intergalactic medium in which the reionization of the universe is still incomplete, as suggested by recent theoretical models of structure formation. in particular we observe the he2347 -04342 system, a system which we believe to be the faint, transition - line emitting qso. the far - infrared ( 1400 ) spectrum obtained with the h.e.s.s
* human housekeeping genes are the keys to understanding the normal development of the human cell. a well - known result has been that the introns of highly expressed genes are short compared to the coding sequences of other genes, perhaps as a consequence of an expression - length correlation. however, it has been noted that the amount of introns does not correlate with the gene length and some other features of the coding sequence are also known to be short. here we show that the structure of housekeeping ( hk ) genes are a unique set of genes that stand out among all other known sets of genes and can be used for quantitative pcr studies. we analyze a recently published set of hk genes and find that the intron and exon lengths, coding sequences and coding - region lengthes of the hk gene set are all shorter than those of the other genes. furthermore, we compare the length - average intron, encoded and unescaled gene segments ( utrs ), as well as coding sequences, and confirm this result. our results demonstrate that the origin of the observed shortening is not due to a bias due to the inclusion of genes expressed in a few tissues only. * @xmath0__dept. of molecular and cell biology, ernst - moritz - arndt - university, f.- l.- jahnstrasse 15, 17487 greifswald, germany. * human genetics is a major part of biology @xcite. the human genome is composed of over 7500 genes that are expressed in 47 different tissues, and this dataset provides a homogeneous picture of the normal human cell genome. this dataset, together with other human bioinformatic data, is used to determine the normal cellular functions, such as metabolism, immune responses, and drug and gene - expression status. this volume - limited data set is the basis for many current and future quantitative methods for evaluating the value of risk and size of microarrays, toxicity evaluation and for quantitative life expectancy. this has made it possible to use high - throughput, massively parallelized, large - scale computational databases for these tasks. one major limitation of current pcr methods, however, is the lack of a large number of well - established reference sets of human genes that can be readily compiled and used for calibration. for example, a recent study of metabolic proteins, showing that they are significantly shorter than ribosomal proteins, has led to the conjecture that the selection for codon usage in nonmamm
we present preliminary results on @xmath0 branching fraction using the cleo ii detector. we select events that are expected to contain an antiproton in the hemisphere opposite the charm tag. we use a combination of two methods to determine the branching fraction, using lepton and charm semileptonic measurements and a double - correlation method to estimate the difference between the number of tags and the probability that a real proton is expected to be present. our preliminary results are in good agreement with results from time - of - flight simulations and data obtained with the fox - wolfram detector. 6.5 in 9.0 in -0.50 in 0.00 in 0sk^0_s ps. 2q^2 2r_2 1spin - one 2gev^2 c. p. jessop,@xmath3 h. q. lingel,#3 c. l. schaff, t. a. mcke, b. e. m. jones,#4 r. mahapatra, j. c. mckinstrie, r. j. mississippi, s. r. amendolia, d. stapelfeldt, w. ketterle, a. b. ugolini, p. h. souto ribeiro, l. lpez, n. g. zhou, and h. weinfurter,@xcite. although many aspects of this experiment are similar to those at fermilab and cern, we have taken a sample with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ), in which we have searched for antiprotons. the sdss data group used the same data group to determine branching fractions of charmed hadrons in the opposite hemisphere. combining our data with the ( *??? * ) branching fraction reported by @xcite and monte carlo simulations we find evidence for an asymmetry in the proton tag statistics. we require that two proton tags be present in an event in the same hemisphere as the anticharm and charm tag, where the latter is a fraction of the tagged events. this asymmetry results from the fact that approximately 87 % of the tags are due to a genuine proton originating in beam - gas and beam - wall events. however, this fraction is sensitive to a second, non - proton component which can not be reconstructed accurately due to the hemisphere correlation of our tags. we therefore conclude that the asymmetry is insufficiently
we present _ bepposax _ observations of the s1 region of the european large area _ _ survey ( elais ) at 15@xmath0 m. elais, covering an area of @xmath012 sq. deg, is the largest x - ray survey undertaken by _ iso _ and the deepest deep optical survey to date. in addition to the u, b, r and i fields this region has been covered in the optical b, s and i bands and in the 1.4 ghz radio at 2.3 ghz. here we present observations of 6 qsos and 1 broad absorption line qso from the elais survey that have been spectroscopically identified. the identification has been made using a combination of optical spectroscopy and broad - band infrared photometry. we find 4 normal broad emission line objects ( 0.4@xft92.6 ) and 1 qso at 2 - 3.2@xcite. we have determined which of these 4 objects are balqsos from the list of junkkarinen, hewitt and burbidge ( 1991 ). the origin of the broad line objects is less clear. possibly a significant fraction of them are obscured by the dusty torus. the type 2 qso iras09104 + 4109 has been confirmed as a qso, while the type 1 agn iras0218 + 1253 and 2200 + 0.01 jy in the _ isocam _ survey have been found to be unabsorbed sources. in this paper we have made a preliminary determination of the hx / mir flux ratio of the high - redshift type 2 agn sources. the flux ratio is consistent with that of a thermal bremsstrahlung emitting source, probably a seyfert 2 or a nearby galaxy, if not a specific agn. we confirm previous suggestions that the high hx luminosity of the sources is due to large amounts of soft x - rays from dust grains heated by the high energy central source emission. the unclassified source 8 is a bright optical source with an extended optical profile and an hx spectral slope consistent with a nearby active galactic nucleus. its soft hx emission, although probably an agn, suggests that it is probably a low redshift qso or a star forming galaxy. higher resolution observations are, however, required to determine whether the 8 unclassified sources are associated with the agn or starburst galaxies or are normal galaxies. 0
we have undertaken an extensive observational program from radio through millimeter wavelengths of high redshift quasars ( qsos ). our sample consists of z @xmath0 = 1.4, and includes high resolution imaging of the cm - to - mm continuum emission from ten sources with flux density limits of 1 to 2 mjy at 250 ghz, and co line observations of selected sources with large infrared luminosity ( carilli et al. 1999, 2002a, 2003 ). in all the cases where a jet - like feature is detected in the mm spectral energy distribution ( sed ), we find a 3@xmath1 upper limit on the magnetic field strength. the flux density of the x - ray feature in j1306 + 0356 is estimated to be 1.6@xfig20.2jy. we have not detected radio emission from the putative agn in this qso, in contrast to the only previous qso detected at lower redshift whose jet was detected. j0836 + 0054 is another example of a source with a steeply rising spectrum, in this case also due to a jet. the steepness of the spectrum suggests that the spectrum at submm wavelengths is dominated by non - thermal emission from warm dust. we find that the rest - frame 220 ghz spectral indices of the radio sources are consistent with those found in low redshift spheroidal galaxies, and that the mid - infrared spectral indices are also consistent with higher redshift objects. these results, along with the indications that the sources in our sample are radio loud, independent of redshift, strongly suggest that the properties of their environments have been quickly enriched through starburst activity. using the best available measurement of the eddington limit for the masses of the black holes and assuming that the radio synchrotron and far ir emissions are due to relativistic electrons, we derive a luminosity density for black holes in the range 5 to 30 @xfig3, just below the limit for star formation.
we present results of n - body simulations that show wide - orbit planetary systems can form in star clusters in the absence of the dispersal of a stellar cluster or stellar association. we suggest that these systems can be connected to the wide population of apparently free floating planets ( ffps ) observed in the microlensing surveys, and also to the generation of stellar black holes and massive white dwarfs. using two sets of dynamical models to describe the cluster structure, we find that clusters can form wide binary systems through both single and binary capture, as well as stellar capture by massive stars. the fraction of capture - formed wide binaries depends on the number of stars in the cluster, and is approximately independent of the cluster size. however, the timescale for the cluster dispersal, measured from the dynamical capture timescale ( @xmath0 myr ), is comparable to the age of the host cluster ; massive stars can therefore capture planets like any other cluster star, through capture from sub - cluster stars. in our simulations, the capture probability for multi - captured wide binaries is higher than for the single capture, increasing with increasing system mass. typically, a star and a planet can be captured into a single planetary system through a single stellar capture, while a binary is destroyed by capture from the remaining cluster members. the planetary capture in this case follows a similar evolution as for primordial binaries, but is more rapid. in addition, our simulations indicate that massive white dwarf progenitors can themselves be captured by capture, forming stellar systems of wide orbital separation. binaries can also be formed from the capture of two brown dwarf planets, as recently suggested by @xcite. the capture properties of these systems are generally consistent with observations. we conclude that the mechanisms that lead to the formation of wide binaries and brown dwarf binary systems are all consistent with the proposed origins for such ffps. we predict specific dynamical properties of such systems, and suggest a possible evolutionary connection between such systems and the majority of observed free floating planet populations.

high spectral resolution observations of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate dust emission from young stars are important in understanding the composition and processing of dust in the early stages of planet - forming disks. we present spectra of 34 low- and intermediate - mass young stellar objects obtained with the infrared space observatory ( iso ). these spectra include emission from amorphous silicates ( 9.2, 10.1, 11.3, 12.0 ), as well as absorption and emission from silica ( sio@xmath13 ; 8.6, 9.7, 13.2 ), for a subsample of 17 sources. the spectra cover a wide range in spectral shape and central wavelength, from strong triangular - peaked emission near 9.8 to nearly flat emission with a central wavelength of 11, to diffuse emission between 10 and 11, and an extended feature near 8.3. all of the silicate emission features can be fitted to a single power law with an index of 1.92.1 ( fwhm=16.4 ), where the slope is dominated by a logarithmic combination of enstatite and forsterite, supporting the evolutionary sequence in sed slope observed in iso observations of high / intermediate mass ysos. we find correlations between silicate feature properties and the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the emission and absorption features. the strongest silicate absorption features are seen in class i sources, which are also the most embedded, while class ii t tauri and herbig ae / be stars have small spectral indices. these results indicate that both classes of sources have evolved passively. in a companion paper ( russell et al., phys. rev. lett. * 102 *, 041302 ; *??? * ), we discuss the relationship between the central wavelength and the optical depth of the 8 - 13 @xfig0 m emission / absorption feature for a sample of young stars. the abundances of pyroxenes and silica appear to correlate with column densities and temperatures, while silicates are observed in emission toward optically revealed stars. in the present sample, we do not find any clear evidence for crystallization of silicate in emission. instead, we find indirect evidence of grain size variations and changes in composition on the observed spectra, suggesting that the crystallization process may be acting uniformly as a function of radius within the planet formation region.
we consider the renormalization of the magnon spectrum in the lowest order of @xmath0 perturbation theory, which is appropriate for low - temperature critical fluctuations of the spin - wave interaction. this approach yields for the spin susceptibility, longitudinal as well as susceptibilities and ( sublattice ) magnetization the results of a self - consistent renormalized anisotropy - group analysis. the results for the transverse spin susceptibility and the longitudinal spin fluctuations are analyzed for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. it is shown that the lowest - temperature results of systematic first - order correction of the magnetization at the critical point are in qualitatively correct agreement with experimental data, whereas the second - order calculations using the zeroth - order approach yield subleading corrections only at not too low temperatures. further, we discuss the weight of the longitudinal static spin fluctuations on the finite - temperature ( within - the - critical ) spin fluctuations, by performing summation of magnon scattering in three different channels. we find that the resulting results constitute in not too big contrast with experiments. j. b. pendry, d. schurig, and d. r. smith, ` ` spin fluctuations in multiferroic quantum magnets, '' phys. rev. lett. * 102 *, 084006 ( 2009 ). m. sorokina, s. s. kivshar, m. asmone, and a. v. kavokin, _ applied nonlinear magnetism _ ( crc press, boca raton, fl, 2009 ) [ 2 ]. i.v. pitjeva, alexander,@xmath1, r. e. boca, j. a. pamulov, v. yunakov, and m. shircher, _ introduction to spin and related statistical mechanics _ ( imperial college press, london, 2012 ), 2nd ed. r. wang, l. zhang, p. huang, x. jiang, and g.e. parkins, _ dynamical mean field theory of spin fluctuations _ ( springer - verlag, heidelberg new york university press, 2006 ), vol. 4839, f.g. rower, ny 10040, u.s.a.
we present the results of numerical simulations designed to investigate the relationship between the physical properties of post - collision clouds and their susceptibility to the magnitude of external pressure, @xmath0, and the efficiency with which gas in these clouds is cycled into potentially star - forming regions. a particularly topical topic is the discrepancy between the reported measurements of the size - linewidth relation for clouds in the solar neighbourhood and the inference that the observed variations in this relation could be explained by not one unique magnitude of pressure, but a range between 10@xmath1 k and -0.22 k @xft, confining the cloud. we model the evolution of this cloud cloud using 11 realisations spanning the range of pressures experienced in a single collision. all but one realisation involve confining of a cylindrical gas - body having initially uniform density, a condition common to all but the least massive clouds. numerical simulations reported in this work demonstrate that assembled clouds primarily evolve via an interplay between the ntsi and self - gravity, though the triggering of this instability is delayed for lower pre - collision mach numbers. consequently, the observed temporal evolution of the shocked slab, and indeed its properties of the gas that constitutes these clouds show significant variation with time and as a function of the magnitude and level of pressure the cloud experiences. + we observe that clouds in low - pressure environment are likely to remaining diffuse and so, consequently, are not of much interest from the perspective of star - formation, in spite of their low gas velocity - dispersion. we also observe a greater propensity to contain diffuse gas as compared to clouds in high- and intermediate - pressure environments. adding further support to this hypothesis, we argue that clouds that are confined by ram - pressure, like the ` ` ` brick'cloud, may well be in the latter stage of their evolution, being confined by an ` ` external pressure '' much greater than the average value for typical clouds located in the galactic disk. heyer et al. ( 2011 ) have reported a systematic increase in the extent of variation of the coefficient associated with the larson s first law for clouds with increasing magnitude of the external pressure. based on our simulations we suggest that this may be as a consequence of the inclination of the cloud surface density profile with respect to the peak pressure that a given cloud acquires during its evolutionary cycle. galaxies : individual : ( a ) ism : clouds gaseous bodies intergalactic medium stars : formation stars : kinematics and dynamics
we develop a model to evaluate the effect of tidal torques imposed by a misalignment of a galactic disk with a dark matter halo on its orbital angular momentum. when a disk is misaligned with the halo, it will develop a gravitational torque on the disk. the torques will initially exert a force on the orbit, which torque torques the orbit and warp it, eventually producing a long - lived warp. the reaction of a disk to a torque is investigated by analytic and numerical techniques. we first show that a star on a circular orbit initially situated in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane experiences a torque whose magnitude depends on the relative orientation of the azimuthal angle of the orbit around the orbit s minor axis. this torque causes the orbit to rise toward the plane of the satellite, not toward the milky way warp. we also show that the self - gravity of the disk may affect its reaction to cosmological torques. we next describe a procedure to study n - body simulations of massive disks which mimic the response of real galactic disks with a rotationally flattened background halo. for these simulations, we find that a torque applied in the direction perpendicular to the orbit will initially induce a warp of the size of the warp, but as the torque increases, the warp radius moves out through the disk, and the angular momentum of the star decreases. the result is that the density of the gas at the time of warp growth is about two orders of magnitude below that at the point of warp formation. however, the magnitude of the torque is maximized at a point during the warp growth, and decreases monotonically with time. to test these predictions, we apply them to a simulated disk of massless particles. when the system is initially warped by the torque, the ratio of the induced and induced warps is close to unity, so that the simulated disk has a universal warp morphology. the impact of these torques on massless disks is not negligible until the end of the simulations, at which time the system has evolved to be near equilibrium.
we consider a polymer chain that passes through a pore in a membrane. the pore is located at @xmath0 and the polymer can move by one - monomer unit to the right or left with equal rates. we assume that attachment is irreversible ( the detachment rate is 0 ). the complete description of the translocated length is given by the distribution of the number of occupied monomers and their positions along the polymer chain. we derive an analytical expression for the diffusion constant for the ` bare'polymer and use this expression to derive limits for small and large adorption rates. in the large adsorption rate limit, we anticipate that the length of the chaperone molecules becomes irrelevant. the limiting behavior of the generating function is determined by analyzing each contribution in the solution. the large deviation function is completely determined by the asymptotic data of the time - dependent problem and is in perfect agreement with the bessel distribution for small time. for large time limits, the shape of the leading distribution depends on the attachment rate and the diffusion coefficient of the bare polymer. these limiting behaviors can be derived analytically using techniques and conclusions from statistical analysis of the aderption rate distribution. the translocation mechanism of polymer chain has been extensively studied in the context of cytoskeletal proteins @xcite. this mechanism is based on the binding of such molecules to the polymer via adsorbation ; the binding rate is essentially a property of the polymer length. in endoplasmic reticulum adsorbption, a large class of proteins is known as the hsp-70 family ( see figure [ fig : ads - transloc ] for a simplified model ). these proteins undergo a process of translocation that we will refer to as conjugation in the following. the growth of the conjugated polymer chain is associated with the formation of a bridge between the polymer and the membrane. this process is quite similar to the one of diffusion in biological membranes, where molecules are assisted by diffusion rather than by being hindered by diffusion. the two processes are fundamentally opposed : in the case of diffusion, the polymer is able to move along the membrane while the membrane can only absorb small amounts of fluid, e.g., the adsorbate and desorbate proteins. in this paper we will focus on the case in which the molecular size is larger than the monomer units. in these circumstances, we will derive formulas for the velocity ( which is the average of the diffusion during a while ) as well as the statistics of the
the emission from non - thermal emission from the colliding winds of massive binary systems is calculated in severe detail on the basis of a model that takes into account all relevant energy losses ( synchrotron, inverse compton, bremsstrahlung and coulomb losses ), the magnetic fields of the participating hot stars, as well as the propagation effects of relativistic electrons in the wind. the model includes klein - nishina and anisotropy effects in addition to the main radiative losses, and it is shown that the primary electron spectra are characterized by a single power - law with index @xmath0. the inclusion of convection / advection effects into the calculation of the particle spectra reveals a possibly visible spectral feature ( possibly visible at the high - energy end ), but the full angular dependence of the scattering process has to be considered. its anisotropic nature leads to variations of the flux level by up to several orders of magnitude ( depending on the system inclination and eccentricity ), and cutoff energy with orbital phase. the maximum flux and the maximum energy of protons in the collision region are both variable over the time scale of the orbital period, even in the absence of a strong system eccentricity. we simultanously also consider propagation effects. for the case of long - period binary systems in which the wind expands sideways along the reverse shock, the dominant process is collisional excitation of the electrons, while the magnetic field causes the emission to dip at a localized level below the stagnation point. however, the low - energy particles can be ejected from the upstream region of the shocks due to diffusive acceleration, and the dipole - like emission can emerge at a few gev level in certain combinations of the collisional conditions. the high energy particles are inevitably accelerated to high energies when traversing the wake of the shocked wind region. their presence may indicate a possible correlation between the stellar winds and the acceleration region, or a direct detection of them. their detectability, however, depends not only on the expected photon absorption in the uv - range from the stellar surface, but also on the electron - to proton ratio and on the wind temperature. we apply our model to the progenitor star wr 140, one of the most magnetized stars in the wr - class, and predict that its emission will be detectable with the upcoming glast instrument icarus at the nasa / esa hubble space telescope ( h.e.s.s. )
we present a study of the effect of spiral arms on the formation of young stars. we use keck / lris and heracles / ccd as well as near - infrared and far - uv images to probe the extent to which spiral arms affect the underlying star formation process. we select three spiral galaxies, two grand design spirals ( ngc 628 and ngc 5194 ) and one flocculent spiral galaxy, ngc 6946, and study how the arm and interarm regions are defined, quantifying the amount of star formation that occurs in the arm regions and compared to the total gas surface density for the arms. we first compare what is observed in the arms with a previous study by leroy et al. ( 2008 ) and find that star formation efficiency ( sfe ), as measured from the h@xmath0 m emission, is enhanced in the spiral arms relative to the overall trend. we do not find any evidence for a triggering of molecular cloud formation, though a triggering may be implied based on the higher sfe. combined with our recent result that 30 % of resolved star formation tracers occur in the interarm region, we find no significant evidence for shock - triggered star formation. the triggering scenario would predict that higher arm strengths and hence shock strengths should lead to higher star formation rates and thus more young, blue stars. thus, despite a triggering scenario, the effect that spiral arms have on the net production of stars should still be small irrespective of triggering. we find that, even if triggering is invoked to explain the high sfe, the enhanced star formation occurs only for a relatively narrow range of arm pixel fractions. this is because the molecular gas, which provides the fuel for star formation, is poorly mixed with the ambient interstellar medium.

we consider the problem of the rashba effect in two and three dimensional electron gases and surface states on noble metals, with and without ultra - thin contact with an itinerant ferromagnet. there are two competing contributions to the magnetic anisotropy, with either a direct or indirect one, based upon the competition between different pseudo - dipolar ( pd ), or rashba - dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ), contributions. analysis of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements on thin films of 3@xmath0mev fe on au shows that the dm contribution is dominant, with in - plane magnetisation for au and a perpendicular dm term for fe. these results are compared with stoner - like models, with rashba splitting " being attributed to a competition between dm and pd contributions. it is suggested that the electrical field, tuned to the direction of the exchange coupling, the pd, and dm terms determine the magnetisation. finally, it is shown that a third, spurious, electric field term, parallel to the au surface, arises in the system and might be relevant for applications such as memory devices or high - density magnetic memories. [ [ section ] ] the concept of a magnetic rashba ( mos ) field @xcite was first introduced by stoner@xcite in the early days of relativistic particle physics. since then the concept has come to be commonly used in the low temperature physics community for both magnetic and non - magnetic cases. the idea is that the zero - bias rashba field, i.e., the energy loss due to electron - electron interactions, will split " ( shrink " ) a band of electrons if the relative energy gain for electrons in the opposite direction is multiplied by a factor of @xmath1, making the splitting " much more pronounced now that the energy gain is shared by both electrons and holes. experimentally first noted the existence of such a splitting " for the case of ferromagnets, but it was later observed that other types of splittings can also be observed, with different origins, such as in superconductors. as has been pointed out by several authors, this splitting " might be due to an effect of an external magnetic field, perpendicular to the ferromagnetic film, but in reality it is most likely due to doping by electrons, with the effect being quenched by the exchange field. recent theoretical studies have begun to explore the
we prove that on a bounded simply connected open set @xmath0 there is a solution of the associated dirichlet problem if and only if every holomorphic function on the set has a holomorphic anti - derivative in the open set is biholomorphic to the unit disc of the set with boundary values strictly greater than 1. the proof is somewhat reminiscent of the riemann mapping theorem which was introduced by osgood in his celebrated paper _ esquisse dun programme _ @xcite, though the general idea of the mapping theorem itself is slightly different this time around. the purpose of this note is to point out that the solution theorem is related to a notion of holomorphic simple connectivity called _ topological simple connectivity _ which is actually a slight modification of topological connectedness defined by rieman in @xcitethat originally concerned with forbidden lines. it should be clear that not all topological simply connected sets are topologically simply connected. we shall discuss this further in detail in section [ sec : 1 ] ; the main result is to show that there is in fact a second proof of the theorem in section 111 that states that every closed curve in a bounded open set can be deformed inside a constant curve deformed into an open set with piecewise linear boundaries. the idea behind this result is that any simply connected set that is holomorphic ( i.e., has a non - negative euler lagrange density ) but not necessarily connected isomorphic is of course topological. moreover, we shall show that the existence of such a deformed curve deformation is generic and hence topological, though not necessarily useful in its own right. we discuss the various ways in which different types of simple connectivity can be used to imply one - to - one holomorphic functions onto a unit disc. one can also apply this general concept to find natural boundaries in bounded open sets. for instance, for a euler - lagrange equation for a variational problem of minimizing the integral of the integral over the space of complex functions, we recall theorems regarding the minimization of this integral under certain boundary conditions. this approach, which we call _ minimization - by - minimization _, is very useful in the sense that it provides a way around the problem of finding smooth domains inside such domains.
the concave real plane of a convex body @xmath0, the polar orlicz projection body, is not a ball, but an ellipsoid. in this paper, we introduce a new argument that uses volume and surface area measures to prove that convex bodies are almost everywhere everywhere differentiable on convex sets. the main result is that volume is continuous with respect to this metric, and a consequence of this argument is a new proof of a theorem by lutwak, w. fenchel, and zhang, q. beilinson, c.r. alexander, and yang, _ phys. rev. lett. _ * # 1 *, * # 2 *, # 3. # 1#2#3_nucl. phys. _ b # 1 ( proc. suppl. ) # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1appendix [ # 1 ] # 1j_#1 = # 1 # 2#3j. high energy phys. * a#1 *,#2(#1 ) # 3j. radnik, a. krasznahorkay, j. ewald, d. rogers, m. eichenfield, and w. schoenfeld + _ lerma, universit de toulouse ; ups, insa, ut1, utm ; + institut fr physik - frei, france. _ + pacs number(s ) : 05.45.+b, 03.65, 05.75, 89.75 + in, v. s. fonsec@xmath1, s. olshanii + _ physics department, korea institute for advanced study, shanxi university _ + shanghai 2000, taiwan 300, p. ryokang, china _ + e - mail : t.ol@kris.ac.cn, h.h.ma@sas.edu.tw _ + it is well - known that for any convex object, schwarz rounding or steiner symmetrization, if the limit of the convexity of the object is a positive scalar product with the vector of the vector in question, then its limit is a ball. therefore if we consider convex objects with axial rotational symmetry, we have a basic understanding of their boundaries, and it is easy to see that their boundaries are very thin. it is also known that lipsch
we consider the energy - transfer properties of the purple bacterium _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _, consisting of a population of 56 bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ sites surrounded by two types of transmembrane antenna complexes ( lh1 and lh2 ). despite the significant overlap in size between the four complexes, there are variations in the geometries between them, which can lead to significant differences in the transfer rates between the excitons. we tailor the modeling to study the effects of energy - level shifts through supertransfer and davydov splittings, with the goal of understanding how delocalization leads to enhanced light - harvesting efficiency. we use an electronic - structure inspired by schulten s and renger s group, along with a realistic inter - pigment coupling that assumes very weak system - bath coupling. we find that there are reduced transfer rates when there are two or more red clumps, but enhancement in the efficiency is not sufficient to explain the large difference between the two. motivated by evolutionary considerations, we propose a generalized frenkel - frenkel hamiltonian description of the system. a byproduct of that theory is a theory of resonant energy transfer ( fret ), which describes the manner in which energy is transferred from the bright end of a complex to the dimerized center - of - mass atomic transition dipoles of neighboring bchls. we show that by creating a sufficient number of such eigenstates within each bchl, the fret rate increases, as is the case for delocalized systems, and the energy is transfered to higher energies, bringing the system closer to the ideal system energy. the theory has potential applications in understanding the evolution of photosynthetic apparatus. there has been much recent focus on the connection between the communication of information about the chemical ( e.g., light ) and physical ( charge ) transfer from a cell to its environment. one of the most active areas of biofilms is entropic driving, which is to convert stored photons into electrical energy by photoelectric dipole - dipole interactions @xcite. because electric energy is a prerequisite for photoelectricity, many cells rely on this mechanism for their survival. however, it has been recognized that it may not be the only one that makes energy transfer through a transmission mechanism highly efficient, and that in many other cells the process is more sensitive to the presence of other couplings. in the case of eukaryotic cells, those couplings
we analyse the clustering of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) selected from the sloan digital sky survey and the 2df sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey. the two samples have identical intrinsic colours and luminosities and hence form the same lrg sample. we study the evolution of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) as a function of redshift, and demonstrate that the best fitting model is able to accurately reproduce the large scale clustering evolution of our lrg samples. we also study how the high - redshift centrals are allowed to merge with each other, with estimates of the resulting halo merger rate consistent with hierarchical models. we find that : ( 1 ) the hod evolution is consistent with passive evolution, and does not require any merging ; ( 2 ) a sub - poisson merger model is also able to match the data, although it requires a significantly larger lrg merger rate than would be expected from the passive model ; ( 3 ) the space density of the merged halo is the same as that of the observed lrg population, and has a central bias of @xmath0@xmath1, which is completely consistent with the observations at _ z _ = 0.19 ; and ( 4 ) the central bias evolves in accordance with the continuity equation, with no evolution on large scales. this is all consistent with a prediction of hierarchical models - the presence of a central galaxy plays a central role in determining the evolution, but the lrg clustering is not affected by this. this result implies that the haloes which host the central galaxies are still viable at high significance. -5 mm september 2014 to appear in the astrophysical journal
in this paper, we investigate a modification of the initial state of quantum fluctuations generated during single - field inflation. in particular, we consider a model in which the primordial fluctuations are described as local - form fluctuations, where the bunch - davies mode function is reduced to a bogoliubov function. we calculate the signal - to - noise ratio of this model in the @xmath0-type distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ), correlated with the cmb temperature anisotropy on large scales. we also study the squeezed configuration of the same model, and find a scale - dependent signature in the bispectrum of that model. this signature could be used to distinguish the model from the purely local local form if the number density of particles with momentum@xmath1 is much smaller than @xcite. [ multiblock footnote omitted ] the study of the effects of inflation is one of the central problems in physical cosmology. since the inflationary scenario predicts a non - vanishing probability of a singularity at the planck scale, any model of inflation should account for at least some aspects of that observation. this paper takes a novel approach to the problem by considering a possible quantum - critical point ( cp ) in the early universe. in its simplest form, a classical theory of inflation has nothing to do with the underlying mechanism of formation of the universe and can only be studied from the phenomenological viewpoint of a model describing the thermodynamical origin of matter. this is a motivated motivation from the observation that the universe may be closer to the center of matter ( the black hole ) than to the periphery, casting doubt on our ability to detect or disprove inflation s underlying mechanism. nevertheless, in this paper we investigate the possibility that a primordial spatially flatness may be a generic feature of inflation, providing a novel testbed for comparison to other theories of inflation. because of the current data, it is very difficult to draw strong conclusions about the nature of inflation s effects on the universe, beyond the vacuum state expected in a spherically symmetric universe.
the honeycomb lattice candidate @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 is investigated using neutron diffraction on a sample of untwinned single crystals grown by vapor transport techniques at the hb-3a four - circle diffractometer at ornl. the materials order in - plane with a three - dimensional stacking structure exhibits a single sharp magnetic transition at 7 k with a periodicity that is strongly dependent on the details of the crystal. the crystals are characterized by a pseudo three - layer stacking sequence that consists of three stacked zigzag layers coupled antiferromagnetically and two layers of octahedrally coordinated ferromagnetic interactions. the micron - sized crystals exhibit a high density of stacking faults due to the low dimensionality of the honeycomb layers. the low - temperature structure displays a significant dependence on the stacking sequence, exhibiting a first order phase transition at 155 k which is sensitive to the local environment and the stacking strength. x - ray refinements of this structure yield a monoclinic space group with symmetrical symmetry within a finite number of layers. this space group is compatible with the arrangement of three rhombic sheets cobalt, silicon and phosphoreuclidean ice particles. the magnetic ordering in the crystals is consistent with a two - layered structure, with one layer ordered parallel to the higher planes and the other ordered perpendicular to the lower planes, suggesting that the two layered planes are the same and that there is no lateral separation of the magnetic ground state from the neighboring sheets. the three layered structure also exhibits a significant diffuse scattering arising primarily from the large - scale magnetization fluctuations. the heat capacity measurements reveal a nearly degenerate heat capacity below 100 k and a nearly uniform heat capacity above 100 k. inelastic neutron scattering and raman scattering. the very small diffuse scattering indicates that the ground state of the material at these low temperature levels is dominated by the kitaev - heisenberg model. theractractors are likely to be the quasi - two dimensional ( 2d ) case with strong van der waals interactions.
we examine the relations between bars and spirals using the relative bar torque, or @xmath1, method. the method is based on comparing predicted rotation curves with observed ones. to determine the maximum gravitational bar torque per unit mass per unit square of the circular speed, we use fourier techniques. we assume a constant mass - to - light ratio, but in addition to the force ratios, we also compute a predicted axisymmetric rotation curve in order to evaluate the correctness of this assumption. if the bar is a typical sb - type bar ( rather than an oval ), then this maximum will usually be a good approximation to the bar strength. uncertainties due to orientation parameters can be significant, especially in the spiral arm regions. we describe how to extrapolate the bar limb into the spiral - dominated regions, and also how to calculate the qfg potential using deprojected bar ellipticities. we focus most of our attention on ngc 6951, the most strongly barred galaxy in the wht sample. we deproject the disk surface brightness profile using available orientation parameters and use the rotation curve data to derive a radial exponential scalelength. we then compute the potential and sky subtraction errors. we find that, allowing for the uncertainties in vertical scaleheight, bar extrapolation, and orientation parameter variations, the force ratio maps are in reasonable agreement with observed rotation curves and suggest that dark matter is not important in the inner parts of the galaxy. we also show that the use of even fourier terms as a function of radius for a bar is probably a fair assumption. in cases where the bar and spiral are well - separated, ( i.e., when the arms are at the ends of the bar ), the relative fourier amplitudes differ according to how the bar versus spiral strength ratio behaves with radius. thus, ngc 4394 shows that our assumption of an approximate symmetry for even - strength relative to the spiral bar torques is a fair one.
i analyze the background gravity gradient noise that might be produced in the interferometric gravitational - wave detectors ligo and virgo. i consider two sources of gravity gradient signal in these detectors, from atmospheric pressure waves and from wind - advected temperature perturbations. in the former case, pressure waves are the main source of background noise around 10 hz, while in the latter case i consider only low - frequency noise at 3 hz or higher. i analyze the noise from infrasonic pressure waves as well as from massive airborne bodies. from these sources i derive a crude spectrum of the gravity - wave spectrum, finding reasonable agreement with a recent mathematical analysis by saulson @xcite. i find that while high - frequency temperature fluctuations do produce significant noise at any given interferometer building, these do not produce a significant increase in the gravity gradient background noise above a few tenths of a percent. instead, i show that the best way to eliminate this source of spurious signals is to eliminate the moving masses that create the perturbing fields. the only way to do this is to improve the instrumentation sensitivity to the test masses relative to the local gravitational field, by reducing the number of moving masses. finally, i consider tumbleweeds, which are hypothetical objects that are propelled along the earth s limb and ankle, and produce noise that is amplified by the sound waves that are propagating through the atmosphere. as an example, airborne bodies accelerating through the air at a sound speed of 20 to 30 km s@xmath0, these objects produce an increase in noise by a factor of @xmath1 relative to what is expected for an earth - borne detector at a similar sensitivity. the difference in noise between the earth and the atmosphere could be as high as an order of magnitude. improved instrumentation will be required to make these interferometers as sensitive to test masses as low as possible to gravitational waves. there are several possible experimental modes for creating this noise, including seismic waves, atmospheric shocks, and building vibrations, although none of these seems promising in the context of current knowledge of the cutoffs in atmospheric gravity gradients.
we undertake a systematic study of a variety of vehicle - routing problems that include the _ additive _ and _ multiplicative _ problems, including the _ path variant of the traveling salesman problem _ and the _ distance - constrained vehicle routing problem _, where we seek to find the fewest number of rooted paths that cover all the nodes in a complete graph, or equivalently, a route that minimizes the maximum client delay. we observe that in general, however, the number of paths needed for a given solution depends on the configuration lp, and that the default value of the lp for additive- and multiplicative - problems is very uncertain. using a simple but key observation that regret can be captured via a suitable asymmetric metric that we call the _ regret metric _, we show that an @xmath0-approximation for asymmetric implies a @xwwwxmath1-gap for the default solution. we then investigate additive - related problems by focusing on a simple subset of problems that involve regret, and our study yields insights and techniques that can be applied, often in a black - box fashion, to derive approximation algorithms for these problems. our main results are : + ( 1 ) the _ first constant - factor _ approximation algorithm for additive - bounded additive ( additive - eliashberg 2000 ) can be generalized to obtain an integrality - gap bound for, which is a substantial improvement over the previous - best result for. + ( 2 ) rather than fixing beforehand the regret - solve greedy algorithm and the corresponding node - sets to cover, we use a dynamic - programming approach to obtain guarantees for the near - optimal solution that uses a set of paths that extend sparsely across the ( additive ) regret - bound. we demonstrate that choice of a relevant metric leads to a bound that is substantially _ better _ than the bound obtained via the standard set - cover greedy algorithm. our work contributes to the toolkit of techniques that have been utilized for configuration lps and have been widely studied in the operations research and computer science communities.
the energy levels of an electron in a homogeneous magnetic field are calculated. the classical result that the average energy is the temperature is reproduced by quantum mechanics in the high temperature limit. the quantum mechanical calculation of the energy expectation value of the ( average ) perpendicular energy of the electrons ( i.e.the perpendicular electron pressure ) is based on the discrete distribution of the electron energy levels over landau levels. it is, however, not sufficient to reproduce the classical dielectric function and the corresponding harmonic structure of bernstein and cyclotron modes. the average gyroradius, a well known quantity, is calculated by normalizing the integral to the average density of particles and dividing through it, thus yielding the very well known and expected classical expectation value @xmath0. this expectation value can not be taken as a particle property. a method for finding the expectation value is proposed which circumvents the use of the discrete energy distribution and is equivalent to using the wigner distribution of quantum mechanical states. the calculation is performed via a feynman path integral. the agreement of the results with the known expectation values requires but a single small modification to the vlasov equation. the modification is not essential and can be done by replacing the landau level correction with a suitable momentum distribution. the nucleus of a solar system plasma is a very hot topic of study. intense and intense research is being carried out in both theoretical physics and experimental physics, with the important questions of superfluidity and electron magnetism being studied in detail @xcite. the understanding of the physics of plasmas is still at its infancy although a great deal of progress has been made, and many important advances in the field are expected, e.g.in the development of quantum spintronics, and in the realization of friedmann - quinn condensates and superconductors @xcitethat are expected to be soon produced. the advances in these fields pose new challenges. for instance, in the fields of condensed matter and cold atom physics, manipulation of the nuclear ( atomic ) or optical ( optical ) matter by means of nanokelvin waveguides is a theoretical challenge which is still largely unachieved. in plasma physics one hopes to make some progress by improving the microscopic details of the problem and by including the effects of the plasma inhomogeneity in the determination of the relevant parameters. the task is not easy and takes place with a much longer time than in other fields such as the cosmological constant or the relativistic
we investigate the formation of radiatively - supported obscuring gas structures around circumnuclear starbursts in order to understand the physical origin of agn obscuration. in the framework of the unified model, it is suggested that the obscuration of an agn is determined by the luminosity of its circumnucleus, and this is due to the evolution of its type. based upon this picture, we solve hydrostatic equations coupled with the frequency - dependent radiative processes to calculate the density and the temperature of the gas. by this analysis, we demonstrate that a geometrically thin, optically thick wall of optically thin gas can form due to radiation pressure by a starburst. when the starburst luminosity is low, the density gradient of the inner wall is positive inside the cavity and negative outside the cavity, hence the gas forms as a torus of subparsec scale. by introducing a radial stratification in the density of the material, the torus is expected to shift from type 2 to type 1 at a time during the agn type transition. we also investigate the stabilities of the obscuring walls, and we find that accretion driven by the radiation force pushes the dusty wall out of the cavity at a density of @xmath0. the escape of the dusty gas is possible only in the case of the outermost part of the wall of interest, where the gravity force is strong. in this case, the gas remains cold and dusty, and it is under the gaseous state for considerable time. the stability of the dust configuration is discussed based upon the approximation of spherically symmetric gas structure. in two - dimensional space, we attempt to classify agn objects according to the type, but the taylor - taylor instability appears as the dominant force at the inner boundary of the space., "., width=240 ] # 1to 0pt#1 # 1 # 1#2 galaxies : active galaxies : nuclei galaxies : starburst galaxies : seyfert quasars : general.
recent observations of high speed, high velocity ( @xmath0 - 100 km / s ) propagating ` ` ` slow - mode magneto - acoustic '' waves in the solar atmosphere have sparked renewed interest in the physical interpretation of these disturbances. the prevailing paradigm is that these waves are generated by thermal or mechanical instabilities in the outer atmosphere ; however, the lack of spectroscopic evidence for a high velocity, high - velocity upflowing component is in conflict with the observations of propagating disturbances in active region loops. to further explore this issue, we analyze _ trace _ and _ hinode_/eis observations of the central region of the active region ar 10940 obtained on february 1, 2007 using two novel analysis techniques : asymmetry analysis and double gaussian fits. the primary results of our analysis are : ( 1 ) the variations in line intensity, centroid width, and line width of the lines seen in the eis time series ( ` ` oscillations '' ) in about 15 - 50 % of the realizations of upflow events are fully compatible with the presence of a faint, strongly blueshifted component that quasi - periodically recurs, and ( 2 ) the r - b asymmetry variations ( which have previously been interpreted as signatures of a single gaussian fit to the spectra ) are consistently consistent with those seen in quiet sun network regions. thus, the degree of obscuration of the upflow disturbances is not a ` ` wave '' phenomenon. instead, we find that the observed ( quasi - periodic ) oscillations in the intensities, line widths, and velocities of the downflowing disturbances require a multi - gaussian spectral line profile. the monte carlo simulations of a fast, non - variable upflow component are in plage - related loops as well as in the photosphere, suggesting that the upflows are potentially important for the understanding of the mass and energy flow in the chromosphere - corona interface.

we observe all the second - to - second trades and instant messages of 66 trading firms in an effort to make profitable trades. we find that when traders trade in synchronousity, their financial performance is significantly increased. the traders instant message communication patterns are positively associated with the rise of sync. we speculate that the mechanisms underlying these empirical patterns involve rapid information aggregation through instant message networks. because traders have different instant message contacts, each trader samples, separate local inferences about the eventual meaning of market information. when randomizing just the trades of trader @xmath0 million trades, the traders exhibit synchronous trading such that the synchronous timing of trades comports well with the frenetic information environment and fast reaction time dynamics of modern markets @xcite. recent research has shown that instant messages can play a coupling role within complex systems. using observational data to describe this phenomenon provided a rich mix of real data but we are unable to completely test these mechanisms. future research might also begin to examine the potential dysfunctions of synchronicity in human complex system. * the study of human behavior provides a unique opportunity to apply the ideas of biological systems to end - of - day performance. for example, currently in the domain of intelligence and national security, many security officers face a frenetic pace of information not unlike the traders we studied. they too receive constant feeds of information videos, text, voice, blogs, rss newsfeeds, and tweets and are in constant communication with their own instant message network throughout the day. moreover, like traders they are also racing to disambiguate news. * key words : * stochastic behavior ; instantaneous message processing ; crowd wisdom.
informatic modelling of biochemical processes can be divided into stochastic and deterministic models. the deterministic regime is particularly relevant as more complex biochemical structures are increasingly solvable with computational resources. the problem of relating model parameters to their environment is particularly challenging as more and more parameters are measured time and data become available. we propose a novel approach to identify the topologically identifying the most redundant ( most orthogonal ) biological components in deterministic processes. the redundancy between parameters can be visualised by the dendrogram and identified using topological clustering tools. our method enables the visualisation of similarities between inputs and outputs of a deterministic model and in a simple biochemical process. it constitutes a unique mathematical framework to describe a variety of compensation like phenomena. the accuracy of the method depends on the quality of available data. in particular, for the case of nf-@xmath0b, the sensitivity of the response to stimulation can be maximised by design of stimulation protocols to increase the number of identifiable parameters. topological redundancy in biochemical processes has been the subject of intense research in the physical, biological and mathematical sciences for several decades @xcite. in signal transduction pathways, from the cell cytoskeleton to the immune system, a major task is the identification and detection of mechanisms that discriminate between different inputs from the noisy input of the system to the noisy output of a transmission system. the identification of the most important components ( inputs ) in a given by the system is an important task in many cases. at the same time, as in any other biological process, this task is highly sensitive to the details of how a given input influences the outputs of that input. as the signals are spatially dependent on the time available for the system, the quantity, i.e. the redundancy, to be defined as the average difference in the total number of inputs multiplied by the ratio of the input parameters over the outputs, becomes increasingly difficult to quantify. in the recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of the relationship between model parameters and their environments as new and interesting data becomes available. in this paper we take an opportunity of using the bimolecular model paradigm to address key questions pertaining to identification of redundancies and non - identifiability that are fundamental to the analysis of experimental data. our current understanding of redundancy in simple biochemical models has been built from first principles. we start by defining the redundancy as a measure of redundancy between input parameters and show how to quantify it efficiently using the available experimental data
the central regions of galaxies contain nuclei that are likely to be the cores of galaxies with supermassive black holes ( bhs ). the average black hole mass residing in a core in a galaxy is believed to be a tracer of this ` ` core - scouring '' process and a more detailed understanding of the structure of such cores is needed. at the brightest luminosities that characterize the most luminous galaxies in the local universe, the observed relationships between the core size ( @xmath0 ) and the mass of the black hole ( bh ) are the most prominent examples of the types of correlations that might be expected due to the presence of nuclear black holes. in this paper, we marshalled a number of less - direct arguments that argue for the hypothesis that cores in the brightest core galaxies are formed by the scouring of a binary bh created in a merger. we then present the separate relationships for core size vs. core mass for a sample of 219 galaxies selected from the _ hst _ sbf survey. for 11 galaxies with direct bh determinations, we find that the large core masses are commensurate with the galaxy luminosity, but the scatter in this relationship is very small compared to that in either the core velocity dispersion or the core - size relationship. we suggest that this is because the large cores in brightest ellipticals are the result of nuclei formed in ` ` ` dry '' mergers " and that the stellar mass in smaller ellipticals is too small to be ejected from the galaxy as a regular part of core formation. regardless of whether or not this is the case, we argue that black hole masses are preferentially larger than stellar masses at the center of galaxies at any given luminosity. we use the observed relationship between core size and the bh mass as a crude indicator of the core mass function to compare our predictions for the volume black hole distribution function to the predictions of the qso luminosity function. while the bhs in the largest elliptical galaxies are predicted to be similar no matter how the rest of the universe is formed, we show that on the central mass - luminosity relation, which applies to less luminous systems, nuclear black hole fractions and not core - to - core mass ratios, are larger than those in the smallest ellipticals. this is consistent with the observations, and points to a differential formation scenario for which the ` ` standard model '' of galaxy formation is either incomplete or greatly simplified relative to the ongoing one based on the bcg / @x
we use the series of microlensing events observed toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) by zaritsky & lin 1997 to discriminate between the possibilities that the intervening population of stars along the line - of - sight to the lmc is a non - homogeneous dark halo, as suggested by zl97, or is a tidal tail from a nearby dwarf galaxy. we find that the probability distribution of event durations is consistent with that expected for a halo with a maxwellian velocity distribution for equal mass machos at the l.o.s. we derive an optical depth for the lensing system of about @xmath0, which is a factor of two higher than the observed value, and agrees with the scenario in which intervening stars are unbound or disrupted along tidal tails. we also examine the likelihood that the events are drawn from either population. using monte carlo simulations, we estimate the number of events required to rule out either hypothesis. considering a standard halo of machos with a mass function centered at the mass end of the galactic stellar imf, we find a standard deviation of about 2.0 events out of the expected total number in the large area surveyed by alcock ( 1994 ). for a population with an m@xmath1 mass distribution similar to that of the red clump stars, the standard deviation is about 3.6 events, and for a standard salpeter imf the maximum discrepancy is about 4.4 events. we discuss possible implications of these results to the nature of the intervening stellar population. = = = 1=1=0pt = 2=2=1pt 2<#1>0.2ex-.2ex # 1 # 1[#1 ] # 1#2#3#4 # 1, _ # 2 _, * # 3 *, # 4 = 0.65 cm 0.51 cm -0.6 in
molecular dynamics simulations have provided insights into the role water plays in the assembly of amyloid fibrils, which are linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. here, we investigate the role of water in protein aggregation by synthesizing results from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation studies. our simulations show that for a@xmath0 peptides the energetically favorable interpeptide association between residues belonging to the chc is the key driving force for oligomer formation. in contrast, for prions, the roles of water and protein interactions are different. in the early stages of fibril growth when the number of water molecules around the protein is small, water is released from the surface and acts as a catalyst for the polymerization process. when the size of the molecule increases above a critical size water molecules are trapped within the protein and subsequently segregate from the solvent by forming salt bridges. results of md simulations are used to provide a scenario for the expulsion of water from the interior of oligomers, which suggests that this process is highly sequence dependent. at the end of the simulation run, the formation of the salt bridge is the product of a self - organized salt bridge, which can be enhanced by hydrophobic interactions. this leads to formation of an ensemble of low order oligomers which include water as a significant structural barrier. this suggests that surface water can be expelled from the monomer through a free energy barrier, which is also responsible for formation of polymorphic structures in polymorphic amyloids. the relevance of formation of water - rich oligomers to the folding landscape of monomers has also been suggested. depletion of water around the proteins is shown to be critical for their crystallization, which leads to a structural separation between the lowest free energy conformations, i.e., monomers in the ground state and in the excited state. an implication of this scenario is that the observed strain phenotypes in prion structures can be encoded in the high order oligomer structures.
we showed using real - time feedback - control of janus particles that were suspended in ion - exchange water and immersed in a strong electric field, able to undergo active reorientation, that their motion can be switched on and off by simply changing the parameters of the electric field. this is achieved by applying a small electric field parallel to the particle axis and using a surface treatment to the ito glass slides. the rotation of the particles was controlled using an adaptive photon - in - cell ( art ) function generator. at the optimal @xmath0, the particles were able to rotate from the plane of the field amplitude up to + 0.73@xmath1. in addition, we showed that the particle can be driven by the applied electric field in a way similar to the run - and - tumbling of the _ escherichia coli _ but with active steering. our experiment provides the first proof - of - principle demonstration of a conceptually interesting idea and opens the way towards engineering functional artificial swimmers. he intimate knowledge of swimmers is limited to weakly interacting microscopic organisms as they are usually screened by small deformations. this makes it difficult to control their motion, and even the simplest task of controlling their motion - identification and positioning can be performed only via thermal evaporation. currently, there is no simple way to design swimmers that can be applied for this purpose. a lot of progress has been made for non - passive swimmers, e.g. in micro - rods and tiling cells@xcite, two - dimensional bounding of biomolecules such as granular materials for molecular motors and self - stick, and the co - coherence of biochemical reactions have been achieved using nano - electro - magnetic resonance fluorescence imaging @xcite. however, the development of completely autonomous devices is still an ongoing research challenge. to reach the ultimate goal of using small nano - objects as autonomous devices, we need to develop methods that can handle small particles in a controlled and controllable manner. one of the major challenges in this regard is fabrication of deformable swimmers because in general they do not have a well - defined shape, they are not careful enough to avoid collisions with the surrounding environment, and they tend to be permanently attached to the substrate they are on most of the time. it is thus crucial to develop new and powerful ways of controlling and steering these small particles. a possible way to achieve small - scale autonomous devices would be to fabricate robotic swimmers by applying an electromagnetic field and
in this paper, we study how some measurement effects that were reported from local helioseismic holography studies affect time - distance measurements of solar oscillations, such as the showerglass effect and the inclined magnetic field effect, by using observations of the mdi dopplergrams, intensitygrams and line - depth data. we also perform inversions of the sunspot - averaged acoustic signals inside sunspots to assess how these measurement effects may affect sunspot interior structures. the major inversion results obtained show that the local ingression and egression control measurements show larger phase shifts in magnetic regions, and also exhibit asymmetric phase shifts when the local magnetic field is inclined relative to the line - of - sight direction, compared to the case of quiet regions. however, these effects do not appear to affect the results obtained from the most optically - selected active region in the northern hemisphere. that is, the difference in phase shifts observed for the quiet and active regions for the two different types of measurements are not significantly affected by the inclination of magnetic field. for the cases with magnetic field strength relatively strong ( t@xmath0 a few @xmath1 0.1 - 0.2 ), positive sound - speed perturbations are observed in the deep sunspot penumbra close to the solar limb, and the maximum depth of negative sound - speeds is found to be located in the shallow innermost sunspot belt. in addition, the second - skip travel times measured by applying self - filtering, or filtering, of the signal - to - noise ratio for highly magnetized signals are found to match those obtained from time -distance measurements at the solar surface. this result suggests that the most likely origin of the acoustic signals observed in active regions are caused by real subphotospheric structures and dynamics, and are not caused by the apparent artifacts of sunspot surface magnetism. it is further shown that these results do not affect the previously reported inversions results for active region when this region was located at different positions on the solar disk.
_ subject headings _ : galaxies : clusters : general ; galaxies : kinematics + we have obtained multi - fiber spectroscopy for 12 early - type galaxies in five nearby rich clusters, using the argus 24-arm positioner and spectrograph. the sample consists of blue and red galaxies with low or non - existent emission and enhanced balmer absorption lines ( dc010347/010746, dc032653/032952, dc204852, and dc184263 ). the galaxies have been classified by eye as having exponential or more r@xmath4 in nature, indicating whether the galaxies are disklike or spheroidal. the distances to the clusters have been derived using the radial velocities derived from the kpno and ctio 4-meter telescopes. + ( 1 ) abnormal spectrum galaxies are common, i.e., @xmath050 % of the galaxies in the sw region of coma show abnormal emission lines, while the incidence is lower in the overall galaxy sample. + it appears that the late triggering of starbursts in galaxies has occurred _ before _ the subcluster passes through the main cluster. this is in agreement with simulations that have indicated that ram pressure from the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) is a primary trigger for the late starburst in infalling cluster galaxies. + in 3 - 4 of the ` ` abnormal spectrum '' galaxies the emission lines have a strong central component, which in some cases is correlated with the kinematic substructure observed in that area ( e.g., coma sw ). in contrast, the rest of the sample shows no such signature. + further evidence for recent star formation in galaxies is provided by their emission - line spectra. in particular, the data indicate that the star formation activity in such a large fraction of galaxies has been recently truncated, either because a major starburst has just ended or because ongoing star formation has been truncated recently. in these two cases, the corresponding star - formation rates were typically 5, while for an sb the equivalent width was required to exceed 20 and 40. +
we present an analytical expression for the geometric quark distribution ( gqd ) of mixed state dqc1-states, a model of quantum computation with mixed state entanglement, in terms of the quantum discord, a measure of non - classical correlations. the expression is valid for arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional states with projective measurements on up to four copies of the final state, and thus has value in many fields of physics and math. we report its existence in a recent experiment and discuss its implications for the determination of the shannon entropy in mixed state quantum systems. we also describe a method to experimentally evaluate the optimal measurement parameters of the qd with respect to several orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. the complementarity between quantum and classical correlations is a founding principle of quantum mechanics. this relation links the most distant past practices of quantum information processing with the present theoretical framework of quantum computing @xcite. in particular, the success of quantum computers has been attributed to their ability to achieve tasks that are impossible for classical systems. this led to an increase in the interest in the study of classical and quantum correlations and has led to important progresses made in the field of quantum optimal measure of quantum correlations. some of the most promising quantum computing architectures, such as quantum networks and quantum information processors, are believed to have overcome the challenges faced by their classical counterparts. in addition, quantum computers have proved to be an excellent platform for the exploration of quantum effects in recent years. continuous variable quantum computing with metrology and quantum optics promises solutions to questions of whether a quantum system is maximally entangled or minimally entangled. in order to measure quantum correlations more accurately, one needs to know the set of all - to - all unitary matrices of a quantum operator. this is due to the fact that a measurement of this set of unitaries can only determine the state of the total system, and the quantum correlation between two subsystems can only be determined on one copy of the state, thus defining a discord between the two. although the original quantum discord was measured, the discord for various sets of two - qubit states has been incompletely understood. luo and fu [ phys. rev. lett. * 84 *, 3157 ( 2000 ) ] showed that the gqld of a general state does not depend on the eigenvalues or distributions of the unitaries that implement it, but only on the distributions of hermitian operators. this remains true to the present - day general state tomography. however, the
we describe a new approach to measuring the far - from newtonian gravity that uses light - pulse atom interferometry. the technique is to localize atoms to a planar position using a magneto - optical trap. the atoms are launched vertically through a series of bragg or raman transitions. the distance that the source mass can be moved from the interferometer does not limit the strength of the yukawa potential and thus a far measurement is possible. the first step in this process is to determine the position and orientation of the block of atoms so that the phase difference between the unamplified paths leads to a new gravity prediction. the second step is to rotate the lasers to compensate for the earth s gravity. the corriolis force is the main contaminants of the signal. we describe a method to remove the contaminating effect. soon after the experimental results are released, they will be available to interested parties. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 f. scheffold and r. cerbino, ` ` the force of a small body in a strong gravitational field, '' proc. r. soc. lond. a * 392 *, 45 - 57 ( 1973 ). s. schaub, m. weinberg, c. kurtsiefer, j. m. murnane, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, p. kamalakis, and a. v. sergienko, _ laser cooling of atoms _ ( dover science, new york, 1983 ). e. knox university, nasa / nasa gsfc, sdos, n.y.-s. kim, w. lee, t. mccusker, r. w. nicholson, s. r. newman, and j. p. oldenburg,``previous work on far - field detection of gravity using light pulses, '' phys. rev. lett. * 104 *, 183601 ( 2006 ). j. c. bergamini, b. g. a. saleh, f. ferrero, l. jacubowicz, and p. s.l. vogelaar ` ` detecting gravity with better than @xmath0 for a distance of several meters, '' new j. phys. * 14 *, 094005 ( 2010 ). d. mcalister, d. b
we present a re - analysis of the full mid - infrared ( 2 - 40 @xmath0 m ) spectra of three quiescent galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) : v404 cyg, xte j1118 + 480 and a062000, which we also include in the analysis : new optical data ( from the smarts collaboration ), and archival _ spitzer _ data. the availability of nearly simultaneous optical and near - ir data for a set of these systems since 2005 allows us to disentangle the contribution of the thermal and optically thick components that may be associated with the accretion flow in quiescence from that of the optically thin, partially self - absorbed component of the jet. in the context of a maximally jet - dominated model, we show that the mid - ir excess emission most likely arises from synchrotron emission from the base of the relativistic outflow, not from the circumbinary material. we construct the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by fitting simultaneously the radio, ir, optical, xmm - newtonian / gmrt and optical / nucl. we find that a broken power - law of a bremsstrahlung spectrum is required to fit the data in both the thermal - dominant state ( when the break takes place at 2 - 30@xmath1 times the eddington value, and when the spectrum breaks to a form with a half - optical to full - width at half - infrared spectral range, reflecting the observed energy distribution in both states ), plus a significant contribution from non - thermal continuum emission. we also find that the break in the sed occurs at an upper frequency corresponding to the break from the flat / inverted radio spectrum, and a marginally radio - loudened spectrum. we speculate that this break could be due to a change in the spectral properties of the inner accretion disk, in which case its spectrum would be indistinguishable from a maxwellian, and the jet radiative efficiency would be very low. we present an estimate of the radio - to - ir spectral energy density ratio ( rms ) for the entire bhb population, based on fitting the whole sed simultaneously, and find it to be at least an order of magnitude below the values found for the high - luminosity black hole systems gx 3394, cyg x-1 and sgr a *, one of the few other systems of comparable accretion rate to fall within the latter sgr
we present an analytic method to determine the bending modulus of slmos@xmath0, a single layer honeycomb potential that is a nanotube of second - neareast - neighbor metal atoms. the analytic method is based on parameterizing the potential as a function of the bending curvature within a single potential element, which was previously obtained from molecular mechanics calculations. we find that a shift of the degree of freedom between two first - nearest - neighbor ( fnn ) atoms, which results in mo atoms on one of the planes and s atoms on the other, contributes about 29 % to the total bending rigidity. the two - body ( pair ) interactions, which are important for the deformed s atomic structure in monolayer graphene, do not contribute to the bending medium. we show that the bending energy density within each unit cell is nontrivial because of the finite fnn mo - s bond length. from the analytic derivation we determine the bend modulus to be 9.61 ev, which is about 7 times larger than the value of 1.4 ev obtained from the molecular mechanics method. the difference is caused to the finite thickness effect in graphene, as well as by the existence of three planes of atoms. epsf.sty there is a great need for finding new materials with ultra - low bulk properties. among these, graphene@xcite, a one - atom - thick film of carbon atoms, is a particularly appealing material because it is extremely well understood and appreciated. recently, a new kind of material, called nanotubes, has been proposed to be used in both optical and mechanical applications, and studies on its mechanical properties have been limited to a few lines of material. nanotubes or armchairs form the basic framework for most of these studies, because they can be readily fabricated, and because they allow one to control the size, shape, and uniformity of the materials. as a result, many researchers have become interested in the bending properties and geometrical order of materials, such as graphene.@xcire for instance, the bending of graphene due to the negative pressure is of great interest, because it can be used to significantly alter the chemical and magnetic properties of the material, and as a resource for spintronics applications. other well - known materials with bends include multilayer all - dielectric composites, where the bending is of the order of a few micrometers, and graphene, a two - dimensional insulating film that consists of a solid block
in this chapter we briefly review the present status of relevant issues in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ), concerning the existence of cosmologically viable quantum effects related to the evolution of a free, massless scalar in a flat isotropic background with a non - vanishing potential. as a free system, this corresponds to the einstein static universe, for which the laws of physics break down and, as seen in the quantum mechanical example of inflation, the wave function spreads adiabatically as it evolves. however, in the presence of a scalar potential, such effects give rise to corrections of a general and systematic nature : inverse volume and higher order terms in the effective equation of motion, as well as quantum back - reaction on the motion of the quantum state. in the latter case, the corrections are of two different kinds : the first ones are from loop quantum gravity, and the latter are of genuine quantum origin. at present the complete set of corrections is known only for the case of a very rare example of free minimally coupled scalar, i.e. @xmath0, in which case effects belonging to the first category are active at all times. only effects in the second category become important only when the universe enters either a high curvature or a strong quantum regime, and subside quickly once it exits such regimes. corrections are related to quantum fluctuations, however, which need to be treated with great care if a general description of such quantum states is to be achieved. corrections of the third type, which remain relevant for non - singular scenarios, are also discussed. some implications for cosmological model construction. in particular, it is shown that some of these effects might be of practical relevance for discreteness of space - time, causality and in effect science. * key words : * cosmology : theory of general relativity, quantum gravity degrees of freedom, circle of curvature, homogeneous friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker cosmology, time dependent quantum corrections, singularity, scale factor, particle physics.
anisotropic equipartition refers to a phase space density uniform on the surface of the system, where @xmath0 is the ratio of energy oscillations in the transverse and longitudinal directions. we analyze the dynamics of anisotropic beam in a linac high - intensity beam with large mismatch between the beam transverse direction and the longitudinal direction. we consider the case when the mismatch is of the order of the dimensionless beam size - rms and when the anisotropy of the beam is an order of magnitude larger than the average focusing force strength in the two transverse directions. the nonlinear space - charge forces produce a filamentation pattern in the plane of the unit cell, which results in the appearance of a beam halo. the halo consists of an inner core with finite angular momentum and an outer halo of axially long nonuniformized core. by an application of the generalized levitov - lesov equation we identify the mechanism by which the emittance between the different degrees of freedom is transferred from one degree of freedom to another. we show that the underlying instability mechanism is equivalent to single - particle effect, if it depends primarily on the electric field due to collective motion. in contrast with an incoherent beam, whose direction dependence can be described by a subspace of the entire phase space, the direction of the asymmetric mismatch mode is identified as an isotropic direction, where the amplitude of the coupling is given by a tranverse coordinate. we compute analytically the variables ( volume, area of surface, and area projected ) that characterize this anisotropic beam in phase space. the variables can be used to characterize the equilibrium state as well. in the semi - relativistic limit, for homogeneous distributions of particles we find that there is a trade - off between two possible states : either the system is in a turbulent state, in which the distribution consists of small eddies with high and low frequencies, or a situation where the particles are in a relaxed state with low frequencies and high densities. in both these cases the maximum energy of a given particle is always transfered to the external environment, and the amount of energy transferred by particles to external fields is proportional to the square of the distance between the two extreme maxima in the phase - space distribution.
we present a spectral analysis of the high - redshift ( z=2.15 ) radio - quiet quasar q1101 - 264 based on the asca and rosat observations. the analysis favours a scenario of a short - lived, low - luminosity quasar which spends only a short time in the active state accreting close to the eddington limit. the x - ray spectrum, if confirmed, shows the presence of the fek@xmath0 emission line, whose equivalent width is particularly high. a neutral or ionized reflection component is not required by, but it is nonetheless necessary to have a solid state component on account of the large instrumental response in order to satisfactorily interpret the data. the most significant result of the present analysis is that the line is robust also to reasonable energy scale shifts which indicates that the feature might be real. the position of the line and its equivalent width are particularly significant and, therefore, allow us to deduce that the emission line is present over a large energy range. the line can be interpreted in terms of intrinsic absorption, but an intrinsic absorption component is also present from the rosat and asca data in the form of an excess of absorption above the galactic value. however, this latter absorption component can not be ruled out with the present data. intrinsic absorption is possibly still present on a time scale of about 10 months because of flux variability in the source over this time period. the spectral slope derived from the joint asca - rosat fit ( @xmath1=0.51.9@xiff6 ) is consistent with that of lower z objects, but the observed flux variability is too low to be interpreted as a signature of the evolution of the spectral index with redshift. ifqs - 264 is representative of the population of high - z radio - loud quasars, the present results suggest that the following should be the case : + 1.0 cm -0.5 cm
i present an analysis of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect on the orbital geometry of transiting exoplanets. i use a simple empirical model to calculate the rotation period of sun - like stars as a function of mass and age. i combine that model with a monte carlo simulation to marginalize over the uncertain masses, radii, and ages of a control sample of 866 stars from the spectroscopic properties of cool stars ( spocs ) catalog. i find that the expected number of systems with misalignments between the orbit and the spin of the host star is @xmath0 assuming that the inclination distribution is isotropic. to quantify the degree of misalignment, i identify as anomalously slow projected rotators, systems in which the projected rotational velocity is significantly greater than the value expected based on the simple model ( e.g., tres-4, hat - p-7, and wasp-14 ). likewise, jupiter and saturn are identified as spin - orbit misaligned systems. in order to statistically assess which of these systems is consistent with the alignment of the spin with the stellar spin, i calculate the number of times the system has been observed close to the sun in the hyades and praesepe populations and compare that to the prediction of general relativity. while optically unaligned systems are always misaligned, the system with the most likely alignment with the spin is still misaligned with the sun. these results suggest that effects of stellar evolution can not explain the rotation properties of exoplanet systems. i also identify the host stars of several of the systems i identified as anomaliesously slow rotators. however, additional selection effects are unlikely to affect this result. furthermore, the likelihood that a system is misaligned along the line of sight is relatively small. if this is true, it implies that the probability of finding a transiting planet in its environment is negligibly small.
the quest for life on earth - like planets has hurled the topic of planetary studies into centerstage : planet formation, planetary dynamics, planetary geology, etc. ; among these studies, the question of planet habitability is of great interest, even if no hard data beyond earth exists, yet. additionally, several types of planets have been discovered in circumstellar orbits, even in close binary systems. one condition specific to this work is that the habitable zones defined in the context of the circumstellar habitable zone ( chz ) around single stars be extended to the case of two sources of illumination changing with the star s orbital phase, or, equivalently, that the chz defined by the single star must be extended by the use of ` ` corrective factors '' applied to the stellar fluxes. in this work we determine the two conditions that constitute the combined concept of habitable zones in binary stellar systems : the radiative safe zone in gray circles ( upper half of the diagram ), and the orbital stable regions for orbits to settle down. the demand that both conditions ( radiative and dynamical ) are met, severely restricts the possible solution of the resulting bhz. we arrive at two limiting conditions for habitability : the habitable zone for a planet with a mass in the range @xmath0 ( where the saddle points on the mercury nebula are located ) and the planetary orbital stability ( the minimum eccentricity and the most stable circular orbit ). the existence of these conditions, together with a condition of orbital stability, guarantees the stability of orbits for all times and not just during the integration span, as long as the binary parameters ( stellar masses, semi - major axis and orbital eccentricity ) do not change. we then apply these conditions to a sample of main sequence binary systems in the solar neighborhood with known orbital parameters ( see paper by frank drake ). we conclude that life, if it indeed exists in the neighborhood of the sun, is most likely of a basic type ( e.g. microbial ). finally, we provide a table of binary systems, in the main sequence, with all orbital parameters known at the present time in literature, with their habitable zones computed using the approach of habitability.
the real world is not where ` ` realism '' is correct. real mathematics is not like the art of science. christian s ` ` one page paper '', published in 2011, is a detailed account of a mathematical model of bell s theorem breaking some of its restrictions. it is written in the language of bell - denier theory, but contains a number of postulates and none of them are right. the novel twist added to his model is that of sascha vongehr, the so - called ` ` quantum randi challenge, '' motivated by the real world challenges posed by einstein and wigner in their work _ with regard to the creation and destruction of quantum entanglement in the quantum phase transition. _ it is well known that the bell theorem does not stand on its own for local realistic correlations such as these, which require the inclusion of hidden variables. even if they were there, or if the mathematics was correct, bell would be wrong every single time. the problem is that the mathematics is also wrong sometimes under certain assumptions, sometimes of a direct kind : when the ` ` measurement outcome '' is relative to a real number, for instance @xmath0, the theory is not correct. here i compare the mathematical justification for such a theory with the analysis of various postulates put forward by other authors, some of which i have found to be inconsistent with the original postulate. i also examine the extent to which the mathematics can be taken for granted that the mathematical framework christian uses can be reduced to a suitable algebraic or geometry representation of any suitable mathematical space. my main result is that, in this case, the mathematics does not need to involve any metaphysical assumptions of free will or of true randomness. it just involves the assumption that the physical processes going on at one measurement location can be imagined to be happening at the other location, and _ are _ real. in this way, it is a mathematical version of an idea often referred to as ` ` locality '' or ` ` hidden location ''. a more or less completely explicit situation can be assumed, namely that the measurements are performed at one location and the outcomes measured at that location are completely determined by _ location _, contrary to what is intended for them to be ( i.e., about to be ) _ not _ in the books title, see, e.g., @xcite. the essential idea is that one should not try to find other ways to ` ` hide '' the measurement outcome at another location,
we present new high signal - to - noise keck hires spectrophotometry of 31 low - metallicity blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) containing 33 h ii regions and spanning a large range of heavy element mass fractions ( from @xmath0@xmath1= 0.2 to 50 ). we have added two more bcgs, mrk 450 and um 311, resulting in a total sample of 76 bcgs with 82 hii regions. we combine this sample with our previous data and apply the resulting new data to determine the primordial helium abundance, using the same method as in our previous work concerning systematic effects : 1 ) the underlying stellar he i absorption, 2 ) the collisional excitation of hydrogen lines, and 3 ) the temperature structure of the h ii region, i.e. the temperature difference between the temperature of the electron and the electron plus the density of gas preceding the big bang and in the present study we consider only one possible additional systematic effect, that of the ionization structure of these regions which we have not considered in the previous work. it is shown that the correction for the helium abundance obtained from the measurements of the microwave background fluctuations is substantial and that it can be as high as several percent in either downward or upward directions depending on the strength of the radiation and ionization parameter. to take into account the net effect of these systematic effects on the determination of the helium mass fraction, we have calculated the he i correction to the total sample and applied the correction factors of he i to 1. with this correction, the result of the steep slope of the linear regression of the he abundance derived from our new data is in agreement with the values derived from smaller samples ( itl97, it98 ). however, the net change incurred by the systematic effects is about 10 % so far and the remaining systematic errors are likely to be less than 1 %. we discuss the implications of our results for the cosmological he i abundance determination using the standard theory of big bang nucleosynthesis.

we have demonstrated high - speed superconductivity ( sfq ) in a superconducting microwave switch. the switch has a four - phase clock that is decoupled from the register by a microwave microwave link. for the first time, the clock power is visible in real time on the chip. we have also developed a model for power dissipation and found that it scales linearly with the number of josephson junctions and frequency. these characteristics allow our circuit to be scaled down to a maximum bias current of @xmath0 %, while maintaining voltage - state logic above 10@xmath1. these findings are relevant to high - end computing, where high performance logic circuits require high efficiency transformers for high common - mode inductance, and they may find application in high - density quantum error correction. switching circuits, where the logical ` ` one '' bits are required to form coherent oscillators, have led to a wide variety of applications including bias - controlled oscillation logic @xcite, fast parallel generation of electronic noise in microwave frequency - domain separated by a radio frequency ( rf ) lattice @xciters@xcite and frequency - dependent quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcites. rfq is based on the superposition of coherent oscillations of two phase coherent states, one phase having a microwave frequency and the other phase having two microwave frequencies. because of the coexistence of phase coherence and phase coherences in the coherent oscillation, the phase - locked clock circuits have been used to support microwave based circuit logic. in this paper we report on a new type of switching circuit, the first microwave microwave switch based solely on stimulated rydberg - like logic, in which the input pattern is a random walker with a microwave second phase. the microwave clock circuit has a 4-photon turn - off as well, operating at a frequency of 250ghz, which corresponds to one of the fastest microwave clocks ever measured. microwave switching is enabled by an ac clock synchronously produced from a microwave plasma source. because the clock frequency is a fundamental feature of rql, measuring this clock frequency at 6ghz rather than the usual 1.4ps, allows a difference in the timing of the switching events between the two phase clocks by more than an order of magnitude. measurement of the clock delay on the microwave chip with a variable clock period provides a novel method of error correction for rql devices. timing uncertainties in microwave switch circuits have traditionally been investigated using voltages in
we consider a model of forward scattering by zn impurities in a 2d fermi surface. the resistivity is assumed to be independent from impurity strength and symmetry. we calculate the suppression of the normal state resistivity as a function of resistivity within the model, and compare the result to experimental data in optimally doped cuprates. the suppression is ag - like, with modified pairbreaking parameter, and its initial slope is consistent with the isotropic suppression for fixed impurity concentration. it is also noted that the initial slope of @xmath0 suppression measured in experiments is a factor of 4 higher than the result for residual resistivity, at variance with the theory proposed by previous authors. we argue that the deviation must be ascribed to effects of strong correlations or strong coupling superconductivity, which are not understood in the current model. s-6pt/ h-7.5pt/ # 1re#1 # 1im#1 = 11 # 1tr#1#2 # 1#2#3#4#1, a&a, * # 2 *, # 3 # 1fr#3(#4 ) d#1@xmath5#1 d # 1vol#1 - 250 transfer # 1(#1 ) # 1cite#1 citeotempciteaciteforciteb:=#2citeo#1 citenum#1irreduciblequantizedacitea, # 2 # 1refref#1 quantum information processing @xcite # 1corresponding author, e - mail : raghavan@mail.ific.ac.uk, where reference # is made. the goal of this paper is to develop an analytical framework, which will allow us to discuss and interpret the implications of a variety of impurity scattering processes, such as those due to disorder in strongly correlated systems. we will consider a tight binding model, in which the role of the interactions is played by eliashberg and van dam, in an attempt to reconcile this model with experimental data. this model is also appropriate for low - temperature superconductors, where strong interactions are known to be present. below we describe the method used to calculate the impurity potential, and then compare our result to a toy model of the same impurity distribution. this experiment yields a quantitative understanding of the disorder - induced reduction of the critical temperature, as well as a sense of the generality of the scattering mechanism. conclusions regarding the physics of high-@x
the constraints on cosmological parameters derived from the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) gold sample are discussed. we investigate the possible multi - variable correlations among observables @xmath0, the isotropic x - ray afterglow energy @xfig.1, the cosmologically - dependent rest frame peak energy @roxmath2, and the temporal break in the optical light curve to probe the constraints. we compare the constraints based on our grb sample with a sample of 50 sne ia with systematically smaller observational errors, and find a tight constraint on the mass content of the universe @xcite. the constraints are significantly tighter than those derived from a sub - sample with similar observational precision. if the sample size and the observational precision are increased, tighter constraints could be established. in particular, we find that the relationship between the jet opening angle and the gamma - ray energy is significantly tighter ( tighter by 0.5 than with the current sample ) than was found by previous authors, even without imposing any theoretical models and assumptions. in addition, we perform monte - carlo simulations to investigate the influence of the size and precision of the sample on the standard analysis. the results suggest that the constraints can be significantly improved either by enlarging the sample with larger sample sizes or by increasing the precision. in both cases, the effect of the concordance cosmology model on the constraints is about the same. we also find that if the cosmology - dependent relationship between luminosity and grb energy is considered, the constraints on all cosmology parameters are weakened by about a factor of 2. regarding the implications on the luminosity - dependent cosmology, we use the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) relationship as a luminosity indicator to explore the grb - dependent relationships. some of our conclusions are : ( 1 ) this relationship is not tight enough to serve as a standard candle for precision cosmology ; ( 2 ) it might be due to observational biases against high redshift grbs ; ( 3 ) it is likely due to a uniform top - hat jet configuration, but this model is not the best choice for deep constraints.
we have used the atca radio continuum and 1.2-mm continuum observations toward two iras sources ; iras 15596@xmath05301 detected at 4.8 ghz ( @xmath062 sources ) and iras 16272 -04837 without previously detected radio continuum emission ( at flux densities of 1.1 and 2.8 mjy / beam, respectively ). the observations show the presence of compact and extended structures in both objects, the most compact of which are thought to represent compact regions in the early stages of massive star formation. if located in the galactic plane, they represent about 0.2 pc in diameter and 0.1 pc in length, representing about 30 % of the estimated masses of the ionized gas within the central 0.4 pc. the radio observations show that the compact radio sources have 2.2 mm continuum emission, indicating that they are embedded in gas with higher densities than can be resolved by thermal emission from individual zams stars. in contrast, the extended radio structure shows blueshifted emission and extended line wings, suggesting that it is the bipolar outflow from a compact object. from the molecular line observations, we estimate the masses and the distances of the sources with high accuracy. the high gas - to - dust ratios in these sources indicate that they belong to the dense core region ; and the high luminosity suggests that at least an embedded massive protostar has already formed within the core. the total far - infrared luminosity computed using the iras fluxes is 4.1@xcite, which is about four times more luminous than the average luminosity of any ionizing ob star in the galaxy. the source is likely in the very early stage of accretion in which the mass infall rate is still high enough to prevent the development of a compact region. we discuss the implications of this result for the formation and early evolution of young massive star - forming regions.

the d - wave machine is a quantum computer of the quantum annealing type. it is designed to solve classical optimization problems, namely to optimize a cost function of many free parameters and problems, which can be mapped on the classical ising model @xcite. the method to achieve the solution is by the slow variation of external parameters and to follow its time development. as an expected result, with time increasing the excitation probability of the system, the system develops with time adiabatically in its energetically ground state. if collapse in a single flux qubit occurs on the time scale of 20 ns, how can the collapses in an interacting ensemble of five hundred flux qubits on a chip, interacting with each other and subjected to transverse magnetic fields, behaves coherently according to schrdinger s time dependent equation and performs coherently quantum operations over long time of seconds and even minutes. + we must conclude that quantum stochastic approaches and decoherence theory can not provide the explanation for the long coherence time of the d - w machine, consisting of a supercunducting loop ( nb or al, intercepted by the josephson junction ( al oxide ), a two - state system with one state the persistent current running clockwise and the other non - persistent current anticlockwise. an external transverse field the illumination with short ( ns ) near resonant photon pulse in the radiofrequency range is followed by oscillations between the two current states, called ramsey fringes, as the qubit is left to develop free with time. the experimental observation is : the probability for switching between the non - perturbed gravonons @xmath0 shows a finite value greater than zero. this observation is interpreted as loss of coherence and the suggested causes for the damping of the amplitude of the oscillations range from experimental imperfections and poor control of the electromagnetic environment, to external and internal noises of different nature and the involvement of various dissipative channels ( charge noise, photon noise, quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap, radiative and dielectric loss, etc. ). = 10000
the discovery of the 125 gev scalar resonance at the lhc opens the door for further studies of the properties of the higgs boson and its couplings to the standard model ( sm ). precise measurement of the top quark yukawa coupling, critical to the investigation of cp violation in many extensions of the sm, is essential to establish the electroweak sector of sm at the highest center of mass energies, and to probe beyond the sm. in this work, we consider two specific scenarios of the ilc, one of which features an additional pseudo - scalar degree of freedom mixing with the sm scalar to form the proposed international linear collider ( ilc ), which is an @xmath0 coupling to scalar and pseudo scalar particles. the other is a general case of model independent effective anomalous couplings, also with the possibility of fingerprinting the departure from the cp - even case in decay distributions of the process. we show that the duality between the two coupling scenarios allows us to achieve a sensitivity of the order of 1000 gev for the first time, and a precision of about 10 % for the second case. [ cols= " < ", ] in both scenarios, the signal of the new resonance is expected to be heavy, and therore does not interfere with the phenomenology at the energy scales we consider. different interpretations of the signals, especially on the one hand, may be relevant in the search for cp - violating effects in the future. on the other hand, the results of the spin, parity, and neutralino studies so far are still limited, as they do not include the effect of possible pseudoscalar admixture. = cmti8 # 1@xmath1 t. affolder, h. akimoto, a. akopian, m. g. albrow, p. amaral,8 d. amidei, k. anikeev, j. antos,1 g. apollinari, t. arisawa, i. artikov,9 t. asakawa, w. ashmanskas,8 f. mukhopadhyay, s. backovic,6 m. baghdasaryan,7 p. baranov,5 m. bhattacharyya,8 c. behera,8 a. belousov,8 t. berndt,5 j.c. bizot, v. boudry, d.
we present the results of a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with the aim of measuring the thermal evolution of the igm following reionization by stellar sources. in the post - processing step, quasars are treated as point sources, and the ionization of and due to stellar sources is computed self - consistently. we postprocess a series of density fields taken from a hydrodynamical simulation of with the gadget code, which has a mesh resolution of @xmath0 kpc within the 100 mpc cube. for simplicity and calculation speed, we use the same prescription for ionizing and heating the gas as sah using the optically thin recipe originally introduced by haardt & madau ( 1996 ). we find that the temperature of the low density igm is determined almost entirely by photoheating, and that the increase in the photoheasting rate due to adiabatic cooling due to cosmic expansion is small compared to the decrease due to photohealing. as a result, the temperature at mean density is overestimated by a factor of 6 - 10 over the redshift range 2 - 4.5. we also present a detailed analysis of the ultraviolet and infrared absorption line spectra derived from our simulation. the ratios of the visual to the infrared spectral indices suggest that there are not yet sufficient photons to account for the absorption line indices at 2.12. however, the mean infrared spectral index suggests that the absorption lines are consistent with having been produced by he - forming galaxies in the distant past. these results are in agreement with interpretations of high resolution quasar spectra which have used the uv - uv broad - band spectral index distribution ( b - parameter ) in conjunction with the falloff of the forest flux power spectrum at small scales ( rauch et al. 1999 ). to assess the significance of our results, we compare their temperature estimates with those derived from high resolution spectra found by other authors and find that they are significantly inconsistent with our temperature estimates. 6.5 in
we present new results on the x - ray properties of the symbiotic nova ag dra, obtained from our all - sky photometry of the galactic halo. ag dra was found to be in optical outburst in 1995 ( its first optical outburst ), and then quiescent with a luminosity of @xmath0 ( i.e. about 9.5 erg s@xmath1 in soft x - rays ) during the 1994 outbursts ( its highest luminosity yet ). the quiescence uv spectrum of ag dra can be described by a broken power - law with an effective temperature of about 15000 k. these high luminosities together with the large fluxes at optical and uv wavelengths allow us to understand the origin of the accretion and thermal instabilities in the system. using the temperature of the hot component derived from the rosat pspc spectrum, we calculate the radius of the compact object and the corresponding blackbody temperature. we find that during the 1995 outburst the radius almost doubled while the effective temperature decreased by about 35 %. the increase of the temperature can be interpreted in two ways : ( 1 ) increased mass transfer from the companion which results in a slow expansion of the white dwarf ( possibly episodic in time ) or ( 2 ) the expansion restricted either due to the finite amount of mass accreted or by wind driven mass loss from the inner edge of the expanding photosphere. we also propose a scenario in which the accretor is significantly heated during the outburst. the high luminosity, combined with the low effective temperature, places ag dra in the region of the hertzsprung - russell diagram occupied by symbiotic stars. such a scenario is consistent with the fact that the mass of the main ( white dwarf ) component of the binary is about 0.50.6, and the radius is about 2.3. if ag dra is an accreting symbiotic star, its turn - on would have occurred before the turn on ( turn on ). stars : individual ( ag dra ) novae : general stars : symbiotics stars : white dwarfs
we discuss the properties of the sources of the x - ray background detected in the recent xmm - newton survey of the lockman hole. we exploit a sample of 24 very faint _ chandra _ and isocam sources located in a small area of @xmath0 square arcmin centered in the hdfn. the completeness and the size of our xmm sample allow us to test the predictions of various agn accretion scenarios. we find that the majority of the source is of type - ii, with a fraction of very bright type - i objects not detected in even the deepest ir and xmm data. about one - half of this population is likely to be compton - thick, an effect which can not be ruled out in the context of the obscured accretion models. for the few sources with spectroscopic redshifts, we find reasonable agreement between bolometric luminosities ( l@xmath1 erg / s ) and predicted spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for dusty quasars. we note, however, that two of these classes are predicted to be much fainter than suggested by our seds. the remaining sources are consistent with being at the same redshift as the bright sources. x - rays : galaxies : active intergalactic medium infrared : galaxies
the trotter approximation is a frequently used first - order approximation to the exponential operator, which is a formal solution of the differential equation of the form @xmath0{4}}=0.359584649349992\cdots. the purpose of this article is to review its continual efforts to construct higher - order exponential product formulas. since the first publication by umeno and suzuki @xcite, it has been regarded as a valuable tool for understanding the time evolution of a time - independent hamiltonian. in fact, their algorithm enables us to compute the dynamics exactly, in contrast to other approximants such as the vector approximation. in quantum annealing, we frequently encounter situations where the exponential expansion of the time - ordered exponential, i.e. the green s function, is expressed in terms of the operator differential or the quantum derivative, and hence has a remarkable advantage : the norm of the wave function does not change with respect to the inner derivation, which corresponds to the charge conservation. we here discuss as to why we should keep this symmetry and not concentrate on the golden s function. the exponential product formula is reviewed in sect. [ hatano - eq0 ], where we recursively construct the eighth - order terms as preparation for the next section. we refer to the right - hand side of the exponential exponent as the tracer of the perturbation. in the case a spin precession is considered, we expand the exponent in the transverse field approximation up to the second - order. we show how to treat the left - side term in the space - time approximation in a self - consistent way. finally, we review the procedure of constructing the higher - than - exponential approximation in the world - line quantum monte carlo simulation. we hope that this article will be helpful in its applications as a tutorial for the users of quantum analysis and dynamical systems for a practical approach to quantum statistical mechanics. * since the publication of ` ` this is an encouragement to you, i would like to thank jaume garriga and thomas hertog for their guidance and support. i also thank silvano and me for sharing with me his extensive studies of fractal analysis. thanks to alessandra mastrobuono, paulo and mikhailov for their encouragement. i am grateful to many colleagues for their suggestions and comraderie for their technical support. especially, i thank to maike meyer, ramin naimi, sanja
a first investigation is presented of the potential for discovery of a signature for the heavier higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) higgs sector to be observable at the lhc. this is done by means of monte carlo simulations of parton showers and associated ino decays into charginos and neutralinos formed from the electroweak ( ew ) gauginos and higgsinos. the signal - to - noise ratio is evaluated through inclusive rates for the associated production and decay processes contributing to the signal. if a candidate for such a signature is experimentally identified, it is shown that its mass is inversely proportional to the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs doublet progenitor into a pair of neutralinos, @xmath0, and then to one or both of these ` primary'neutralinos decay into other neutralinos ( or other sparticles ), which in turn give rise to leptons ( _ with no additional colored daughter particles _ ). the contribution from such a decay chain is taken into account. additional decays that may lead to the same signature are also considered, including : decays to chargino pair - production, in which case the signal is dominated by ino production into four leptonic pairs ( one of which is the lightest ) and one of the heavier neutralino pairs ( the bottom quarks ). identification of such decays / jet showers of these third generation fermions may well be problematic for the qcd - based analyses of the leading quark mass spectrum, so that it is imperative to include these in our searches. @=11 caption#1[#2]#3 @=12 at m_laboratory for theoretical physics, p.o. box 51, fi, fi-00019 - 483, brookhaven national laboratory, upton, ny 11973, usa d.f. kimball and u. lee, ` ` search for the dark matter analog of the universal higgs signature, '', phys. rev. lett. * 98 *, 048302(r ) # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 3 # 1eq.

in metazoans, the concentration of a freely diffusing species, @xmath0, is known to be a key determinant of whether a cell will be inhibitory or signaling. in the simplest model of signaling, the inhibory species is produced at a kinetochore and then diffuses in the cytoplasm, but only until it either encounters a minus - end directed microtubule - bound molecular motor, or decays to an inactive form. since both mad2 and bubr1 are known to bind to cdc20, we can tentatively identify the inhibiting species with this complex. based on this model we propose two possible mechanisms of signaling in metazoan cells. the first is a mechanism in which a ` ` go anaphase '' signal is transmitted from the spindle pole by molecular motors. if such a motor were linked to the mad2 binding site then inhibition of the inhibitory signal would essentially shut off the active transport. however, data from frap ( fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ) experiments on the state - of - the - art model of the metazoan sac show that fluxes on the disk are sufficient to maintain inhibition. therefore, we find that both mechanisms are possible to explain the experimental data. the second mechanism is based on an active transport mechanism. in this model, an extra process is added to the pathway by a diffusive amplification step. we predict that if this model is correct, then cell anaphases should be triggered by an external signal. indeed, we show from our model that the time for this signal to diffuse across the cell is much shorter than the timescale for reactions within the cell. thus, our model with an amplification step is able to explain some of the observed features of the sac. these findings are qualitatively consistent with models where inhibition propagates purely diffusively away from incomplete kinetched kinetchores, or in other words, where the cell spindle plays an active role. * how genes are regulated by chemical signaling is a key issue in biology. if a chemical agent is responsible for a chemical reaction then it is critical to determine the effects that the associated molecule is doing. for example, the power to drive dna synthesis in yeast is needed to counter the effect of dna damage @xcite. similarly, the importance of the ability to detect and respond to changes in environment, for example due to the effects of humidity, is required to determine if a drug that targets cells with a negative target is effective
modern terrestrial telescopes facing the horizons may soon reveal a new electromagnetic meteor shower phenomenon, ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ). most of the so called @xmath0 ( or tens - hundred gev ) electromagnetic signals from pevs up to eevs and above, mainly of hadronic nature ) are originated at the far away horizons. their electromagnetic signature might be hidden by the distance but its tail may arise in a new form by its secondary muon - electron - cerenkov flashes of electromagnetic nature. on the same time a more rare ( three - four order of magnitude ) but still exciting pev - tevs neutrino astronomy may arise by the earth - skimming horizontal tau air - showers ( hortaus ), part of a wider and spread horizontal muon bundle of large multiplicity born at tevs - pev or higher energies, as secondary of horizontal shower. between the two cases there is a smooth link. a main hadronic contribution to the total electromagnetic signal will likely come from a unique muon primary ( a.k.a. ` ` single '' muon ) up to a multi muon production by rarer muon, a.r.f. ; these rarer and more powerful rarer rarer ` ` chain '' muons are produced inside the earth crust by the primary uhe neutr muons born at tens - pevs energies by the corresponding tau oscillations. the dominant ( but not necessarily noisy ) signals from then on, at a few hundreds km distances away from the earth, are the usual gamma ( and consequent ( single ) and ( hidden ) electromagnetic showers, that are usually rather noisy ) ; a single muon will blaze just alone. while bouncing off of it, a second ( very penetrating ) muon while hitting the telescope may spread far away ( tens of km far from the shower origin, at an increasing rate ; its nearby showering, while decaying into electrons in flight, will be partially suppressed by the horizontal air opacity. finally just above or below the horizon edge, within a few hundred of km distances, it might also be observable the almost simultaneous ( nanosecond - microsecond ) optical signals just at minimal magic threshold value. similar signals may be abundant and better observed if uhe and c.r. showers share new extra - dimension ( tev gravity ) interactions : in this case also neutrinos are born in topological defect decay or in their annihilation, containing a relevant component of sus
the couplings between two molecules that are attached to each other by a short - range coulomb interaction are important in understanding the origin of carbon - oxygen asymmetry in natural complexes. in order to gain insight into this issue, we performed coupling calculations for the bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ ( bchl__a _ _ _ ) complex using standard quantum - chemical kinetic theory or, alternatively, using extended dipole, tresp, and tinker geometries. we calculated the couplings using both standard cis and tddft approximations and compared the results with experiment and with the allinger allinger forcefield calculations. we found that the tinker approximation gives a better agreement with the experiment than cis or dft calculations at intermediate molecular separations, although the latter method tends to overestimate the dipole moment of the transition dipole. we checked the applicability of tresp by comparing the results calculated using a model hamiltonian with the experimental value for the asymmetry wavelength and found that it provides an excellent description of the experimental data. using the cis/tddft approximation, we also calculated the @xmath0d transition energy for the excitonic couplings. at large, intermediate- and high - density transitions, we find that the crystal structure is the most reliable approximation to describe the experimental transition density as originating from _ ab initio _ transition charges. in contrast, the tdc method _ in its original form fails to reproduce the correct size of this transition, even at high density, and can therefore be used as a benchmark to compare the results of geometry optimization with that of cis. we also show that the difference in the evolutionary steps between the two methods is substantial, indicating that further work on this problem is required. the theoretical framework presented here is a step forward in our understanding of the electronic properties of chlorophylls. since the early days of chemical synthesis, it has been recognized that many naturally occurring complexes are underdense due to the presence of small numbers of small - molecules. this has led to a great deal of interest in the structure and dynamics of their interactions, ranging from important biological functions such as transcription and synthesis to technological applications @xcite. one of the most active areas of research in strongly correlated electron systems is in understanding how they are formed and their origin, for example, whether or not they are stabilized by dissociation or by interactions with other molecules. in this work, we investigate coupling calculations of two distinct species that are bound by a long - range
we consider the effect on supernova physics of having resonant spin - flavour precession ( rsfp ) conversions induced by non - zero transition magnetic moments ( tmm ) in the progenitor of a core - collapse supernova ( sn ). we show that such conversions could have an important effect in the presence of strong magnetic fields @xmath0 gauss during the later epoch of supernova evolution ( few seconds after the core bounce ) for sn ( anti- ) neutrino detection rates, similar to what occurs for the active - active case. we also investigate the effect of such tmm conversions on the transition magnetic moment of dirac neutrinos between the sterile and the sterile phases of the oscillating electroweak states, as well as on the supernova nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. although expected to be small, e.g. dirac - like magnetic moment would be enhanced in the region enclosed by the contour, any significant ( larger than the equipartition parameter ) conversion of neutral ( i.e. neutral - hydrogen - like ) tmm would be controversial since it would contradict existing bounds from the laboratory experiments. on the other hand, we find that only a minimal amount of resonant re - conversion of matter into sterile species would lead to a significant enhancement of the @xcite indicator, so that overall it is necessary to have a rather large magnetic field in order to observe resonant rsfps. the main parameter in this context is the magnetic field strength ( or indeed all the parameters of the matter component ) which is proportional to the ratio of the outgoing ( dirac ) and the incoming ( sterile ) magnetic moments. we have estimated the suitability of the above parameters for sn 1987a type supernovae and found that for a plausible shock re - heat rate of 10@xmath1/yr, or a fraction of the total shock energy ( or more ) less than 10 % of the sn outburst energy, a sufficiently large ( and probably secular ) magnetic field would be required to explain the observed data. # 1#2.1em.5ex-.1em /-.15em.25ex # 1to 0pt#1
we study the color - magnitude relation in the rich cluster cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 using a large mosaic of spectra obtained with the multiple mirror telescope and the william herschel telescope. the morphologies of the galaxies in the cluster were determined ; magnitudes for 387 galaxies were determined from the same sample of galaxies. the cm relation of the elliptical and the s0 galaxies is well defined and shows no significant scatter. only the ellipticals show a well defined relation ; in contrast, the spirals and the irregulars show a large scatter in the color. assuming a distance - dependent star formation history, we find that the most recent star formation episode must have occurred at least 15 gyrs ago, and may have persisted to quite high redshift if there is a significant population of blue early - types in the outer parts of the cluster. we calculate the expected number of blue galaxies in such a population and find it to be very little. this result is in qualitative agreement with the prediction of a butcher - oemler effect that produces few bluer galaxies than the red ones. we construct model atmospheres for the star formation histories of the early - type galaxies and investigate the effect of varying morphological type on the derived relations. the simulations indicate that the observed scatter is not very sensitive to environment, and that the scatter and mean color are strong functions of galactocentric radius from the cluster center. the mean color and scatter of the ellipsoid galaxies are similar in the inner and outer parts the cluster, and are unlikely to be explained by a gradient in bulge - to - disk ratio or morphological peculiarities. = = = 1=1=0pt = cmbx10 scaled2 = cmss10 = cmr7 = cmmi7 = cmti7 # 1to 0pt#1 _ accepted for publication in the astrophysical journal. _ * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) to be published in the proceeding
we present new photometric and spectroscopic data in the field of the old open cluster ngc 2112. we cover a field of @xmath0 with the 3.5 m smarts 1.0 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory. this allows us to clean the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) using advanced camera for surveys ( atca ), which is operated by the smarts consortium. + we obtained bv photometry in the cmd for about 80 stars, down to v= 20.3. we found that the cluster is old ( 3 - 5 gyrs ), has a reddening of e(b - v)=0.60.3 mag and is located 700@xmath5800 pc from the sun. in addition, we obtained moderate resolution spectra from the literature for 6 stars, and found 21 new radial velocity members. + by means of multi - fiber spectroscopy, we recovered the cluster s metallicity. the cluster has a value of [ fe / h ] = -0.15, slightly lower than the solar value. the abundance pattern of iron is found to be marginally enhanced with respect to the sun, but still compatible with the trends of thin disk stars in the solar vicinity. assuming spherical symmetry, the abundance ratio of the heavy elements ( i.e. na and si ) is close to solar, while all the other elements ( fe, s, ar, mn, co and nd ) are consistent with the metal abundance as low as -1.2. + our new dataset has led us to revise several conclusions in the study of the cluster. the most important result is that the surface density of cluster stars is significantly higher than has been found in previous investigations. this is in good agreement with what was suggested by richtler ( 1985 ), and supports the suggestions by geisler & claria ( 1991 ) and clarify a long lasting controversy on the properties of this cluster. finally, our study has shown that some stars lying off the best fit padova isochrone may in fact be unresolved binaries. a detailed analysis suggests that some of them lie very close to the binary locus, and we indicate them as candidates for unequal mass binaries.
we present a new sample of obscured agn in the midst of the transition from the starburst to the quenched post - starburst phase of galaxies, which is a newly identified class of bulge - dominated agn which is characterized by the presence of multiple emission lines but no strong agn emission lines. we identify 1094 agn ( @xmath0 ) in this new sample through galex and wise photometery, making it the most homogeneous list of agn yet identified. 10 % of the host galaxies have no agn associated with them and the rest are optically classified as normal star - forming galaxies. we show that the majority of the 1096 agn are hosted by starbursts which have recently peaked their activity, with a fraction as high as 45 %. this is despite the fact that our sources are selected using only two methods : the near - uv to optical continuum index and the dust - corrected global dust distribution. the ir continuum indices are the same as those for both sb and psb galaxies, and we use them both to search for agn signatures. instead of using the stellar continuum indices, we use the galaxy velocity dispersion as a proxy for star formation rates ( upper limits ). this enables us to estimate the agn fraction in a given galaxy with the highest possible probability of being a quenching object. we find that agn activity is associated with merging or disturbed rather than pure star formation, and the fraction of merging galaxies is highest in massive starburst galaxies, consistent with the merger origin for these objects. we also find that, despite their high merger rates, most agn reside in relatively smooth morphologies. e / s0 galaxies are also found to be dust - obscured and follow the merging sequence directly. we infer that the sbs and psbs host a smaller, more compact, and with high stellar surface mass density than non - star forming normal galaxies. the similarity in morphology suggests that accretion and merging are closely related. however, the well known but still poorly understood agn fast - track galaxies may be an exception to this trend.
we use high - resolution, low - resolution cosmological n - body simulations to model the assembly of supermassive black holes from seeds at redshift 20 to supermassive smbhs at zero, incorporating the important sub - resolution physics of black hole dynamics and gas accretion. we identify dark matter structures ( dark matter halos, seed them with population iii black holes ), and follow their merger history from redshift20 to 0 by constructing merger trees. we find that, for a given seed mass, major merger - driven accretion is the dominant source of gas inflow throughout dark matter halo growth. however, even with such a low form factor, a larger merger timescale than has previously been used, the merger rate is large enough for smbh mergers to remain an important lisa source. we also study the effect of changes in the assumed black hole occupation fraction and dynamical friction on the black hole merger rate. using eddington - limited accretion and the most recent stellar evolution estimates, we define the transition mass from giant black hole to small black hole ( smbh ) mass with a mass ratio of 1/10 than that of the milky way galaxy. by track the growth of smbh from a seed black hole at z @xmath0 20 to the largest black hole mass black hole in the history of the universe ( m@xmath1 ), we show that the growth is strongly dependent on what fuel is driven to the center during major mergers. while the central black holes merge with the companions at high redshift, the delays in the merger timescales depend on the quality of the gas physics and the presence of a smbh ( or dwarf ). using these results and a prescription for the self - similar formation of massive white dwarfs, we estimate that there are only a few tidally - stripped satellite halos in the redshift interval 0.3 - 6 that host overweight black holes with masses in excess of m1. the most pessimistic picture of this scenario is that the occupation fraction of seed black holes is less than 0.004, which is very similar to the currently accepted picture of the evolution of the first stars. our merger rates indicate that the high mass end of the smbh host halo relation is established on a much smaller mass scale than that seen in studies of other galaxy types, including nearby spiral and elliptical galaxies. the implications of this result for the search for the root cause of the galaxy - smbh connection are discussed.
ngc 288 and ngc 362 form what is perhaps the best - known ` ` second parameter pair '' of globular clusters, and previous analyses of this pair have required fairly large age differences. in the present paper, a more modest analysis of the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology of ngc 288 is presented, which is enabled by a newly derived low - resolution spectroscopic mass function and, for the first time, a comprehensive multi - wavelength hb morphology analysis. it is found that, for a metallicity @xmath0, the turnoff age difference for this pair is fairly small, in the range 10@xmath1 gyr, and is fully consistent with the ` ` age as the second parameter '' hypothesis. moreover, it is shown that application of each of catelan s mass loss formulae is able to account for the difference in hb ages for the ngc288/ngc362 pair. remarkably, our analysis also reveals that the previously reported discrepancies between the zinn & west ( 1984 ) and carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) metallicities can be resolved if the latter scale is adopted on the basis of the observed hb dispersion. using the photometric errors from paper i as a guide, an equally conservative upper limit to the clusters actual metallicities is derived ; the latter, however, requires significantly higher [ fe / h ] than found in previous studies. in order to fully understand the significance of these results, we also investigate the relationship between the hb mass and the mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ). we confirm previous suggestions ( van der jeugt et al. 2001 ) that the presence of relatively short - lived population of arbhb ( as opposed to fainter bhb ) stars in ngc 292 can give rise to a significant evolutionary effect on the rgb, but this effect appears to be much more likely to be related to the well - known breathing pulse effect, an extremely rapid rate of rgb mass loss which, if found, would require a drastic change in the treatment of rgb stars at the onset of the rgb phase. we also suggest that the apparent overluminosity of these arbhb stars may be a result of a process different from the one that generated the bulk of the initial hb population of the cluster.
we show that heat pumping in a mesoscopic system is possible but it is difficult to design efficient protocols for pumping. we find that an approximate jarzynski equality for a steady state coupled to a nonequilibrium steady state can be used for pumping mesoscopic systems. it is remarkable that the heat current between two different heat baths can be induced by the conjugate driving of a closed system. this implies that a step - by - step design of efficient pumping protocols can be formulated in a few simple steps. self - organization is one of the most fundamental principles of biology. for example, the brain may be connected to its environment via nonlinear mechanisms @xcite. in contrast, the bladder in a fluid may interact with its environment, and this process may give rise to local oscillations or spasm states depending on the stimulus. this phenomenon of ` ` motion in a sea '' was first observed by carollo in his laboratory experiments in the 1920s. since then there has been a great interest in the motion of microscopic bodies in environments other than the equilibrium ones. an important example is the josephson effect in the brain, which arises when one crawls around in a solid solid. another example is markovian stochasticity, which originates from the nonlinear dynamics in the system s microstates. various studies indicate that the driving force behind a particle may be comparable to the one responsible for its motion. thus, ` ` pumping in equilibrium '' is an attractive topic not only for physicists but also for chemists and materials scientists. carollo observed that a system which is in contact with a flow ( i.e. a heat bath ) could be pumped by a suitable classical operation under steady driving. he formulated a formula to evaluate the efficiency of this pumping. surprisingly, he could achieve the same efficiency without any adiabatic increase in the time cost of the pumping process. this shows that the pumping is efficient even when the speed of the operation is finite. in this paper, we study the pumping problem in a general mesoscopic setup and show that a formula derived from jarzynski s equality to steady states can be applied for different types of pumping protocols. we apply this theorem not only to analyze the efficient pumping but also to design the operating conditions in order to achieve the desired results.
we study the magnetic properties of the @xmath0 model on triangular antiferromagnet in the strong coupling regime. we find the system is in a coplanar spin long range order at half filling due to the nagaoka physics. at the half filling, the particle hole symmetry is broken and the sign of the hopping term is essential. the interplay between the two results allows us to determine the mean field phase diagram of the model with a semiclassical analysis. we obtain a general phase diagram for the system which is characterized by the value of the spin berry phase. in the reduced brillouin zone of the three sublattices, there are three branches of nondegenerate spinon modes. in each black box, there is only one gapless spinon mode which is sensitive to the structure of the ground state wave function. the condensation of this mode give rise to a ferromagnetic long based order of the spins. this is the first example for a quantum phase transition between different orders and it may serve as the first explicit example for phase transitions between different quantum orders with the landau - type description. we also find a canting ansatz in this model and determine the corresponding excitation spectrum. we argue that the spinberry phase is responsible for the bulk magnetization in the na@xmath1coo@xjs2 system. the phase diagram consisting of the canting, spinbary and spin redshifted modes is a by - product of this study. because of this, we also achieve an improvement over earlier schwinger - boson mean field theory of the system. pacs number(s ) : 74.25.dw, 42.50.lc, 85.60.+e electronic structure and dynamics of solids solids are very interesting and have been the subject of recent research activity since long ago. one of the important problems in this field is the low temperature behavior of the electronic states. although the low energy behavior has been studied in a large number of systems, a comprehensive understanding of the basic properties is not yet clear. especially, the question about the role of spin fluctuations on the electronic properties has not been satisfactorily answered. recent experiments on cuprates may shed light on this problem. it is believed that the recent discovery of superconductivity below t=4 may prove to be the answer for the long standing question. in particular, experience in the cuprates tell us that the magnetic degree of freedom may play an important role in the
we explore in a transparent way the effects of feedback driven outflows and gas re accretion on the specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) histories of galaxies as a function of stellar mass in the context of hierarchical cosmogony. we consider a set of hydrodynamical models of disc galaxies formed inside growing cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos with initial masses of @xmath0, and for several different values of the disc mass function parameter, including initial star formation rate ( sfr ), stellar mass and the sfr history. the pressure to produce the observed ssfr histories of low mass disc galaxies is shown to be largely driven by the hierarchical halo mass aggregation rate which on average increases with redshift at nearly the same rate for all masses. however, at a given epochs, _ the mass aggregation rates of massive _ halos seem to decrease systematically as the mass decreases, a phenomenon called _ downsizing_. we show that this _ systematical _ trend of _ increasing _ ssfr is a consequence of the later growth of the relative stellar mass, _ i.e. _ the ssfr of less massive halos is delayed by some astrophysical processes to lower redshifts. we explore the potential problem of ssfr downsizing _ ( hereafter ssfr ds ) related to the dependence of the stellar mass on the epoch of formation and the mass of the cdm halo, and find that the causes of the downsizing phenomena, namely the lower the mass, the higher the ssfrs of _ all _ mass _ galaxies with respect to their lower masses. a possible solution to the problem is to assume that, in the hierarchical scenario, the main stellar formation epoch of _ low mass _ low - mass galaxies occurs slightly later than that of _ massive _ high mass halos. moreover, it is shown that the gas ejected from the halo system can be re accreted later on the disc, _ but it does it in a _ negative _ way. detailed theoretical predictions are compared with observations. we discuss some caveats of the models, including the initial state parameters, the uncertainties in the determination of the gas parameters, and the assumed initial gas mass. overall, however, our study shows that the effects are small and, at least for the masses considered, are positive, leading to a _ positive _ deviation from the observed sfr - ds trend.

in this paper, we present a new method of calculation of surface tension for square well ( sw ) fluids. the method is based on two theoretical methods, integral equation theory(iet ) and thermodynamic perturbation theory(tpt ). both methods aim at accurate description of sw fluids. to solve the oze, we use the sarkisov bridge function. but in our previous work, we were able to obtain the rdf and the dcf inside the spinodal and close to the critical region without any problems of convergence of the iteration scheme. here, we extend the theory to non - hard sphere reference functions. we obtain radial distribution function ( rdf ), direct correlation function ( dcf ) etc. for sw fluids of various ranges and compare with those obtained from iet and simulations. the theory is also applied to the lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid. in this application, some of the closures obtained fromiet do not have a solution. the isotherms and the lvpd for lj fluids of ranges @xmath0 are obtained and compared with simulation results whenever available. our results show that except for very low temperatures and low densities, the derivatives of fifth and seventh order tpts have negligible deviation showing that the taylor series for helmholtz free energy has converged. however, for very short - ranged inter - particle potentials, the converge of the free energy series becomes very slow and requires higher order terms in the calculations. to overcome this difficulty, we propose a modified form of the present method in which the first derivative of the bridge function is written as a mclaurin series in perturbational series which can be obtained by using a finite difference method. a comparison of the derivatives obtained by including derivatives of bridge function in the calculation and those obtained by neglecting them shows that the correction due to the derivatives becomes important close to critical region and along the liquid side of the phase diagram. despite the improvements, true description of thermodynamic and structural properties of simple liquids with narrow potentials is still lacking.
we report on the analysis of the x - ray multiwavelength properties of the vela pulsar and its surrounding nebula using data from 20 phase intervals obtained with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observatories. a clear modulation in the shape of the pulsar emission, as seen in the 20 kev epic light curve, is found to be present in the pulse profile emerging from the two energy - resolved epic / pn light curves in the energy range 28 kev. the shape is also seen to change with the pulsational phase, with a minimum of the thermal component at 180 degrees, and a maximum of the cool component at 250 degrees. we find that the maximum extension of the hotter thermally emitting region is observed when looking at the polar region of the neutron star. the radius of this extended emission is in agreement with the value inferred from the phase averaged spectrum of a neutron star composed mainly of neutron. we also observe a non - thermal component detected in a small phase interval 180 from the radio pulse, when the thermal components are at their minimum : this may be produced by particles accelerated in the star magnetosphere. the phase - resolved spectra of the hot ( @xmath0 kev ) component are well fitted by a three - component model ( two blackbodies + power - law plus a ` ` secondary '' component ), best described by a simple two - blackbody model with a temperature distribution and a 0.2 - 0.4 kev core radius. the spectral model fits to the measured from the 70 kev energy - spectrum are in good agreement with each other, the hot blackbody component being slightly cooler than the cooler one. a phase - dependent modulation of the outer emission of the slow thermal component is also found, which might be related to magnetospheric emission of a small fraction of the surface photons. # 1 # 2 _ astron. astrophys. _ * # 1 *, # 2 = = = 0.8 cm = = 1.0 cm = -0.5 cm [ firstpage ] accretion, accretion discs pulsars : individual ( vela ), binaries : general, stars : neutron, x - rays : binaries
in this work we present an extensive statistical analysis of turbulence in collisionless plasmas in the presence of pressure anisotropy. to this purpose we performed three - dimensional simulations of the standard isotropic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model with an applied compressible alfvn and compressible compressible slow modes. in order to understand the role of the different instabilities in the evolution of the system, we performed the simulations under the double - isothermal approximation. we derived probability distributions of the density and velocity fluctuations and structure functions of the fluctuations. we also studied the correlations between different scales in the simulations. our results show that the anisotropies of the plasma fluctuations with respect to the global magnetic field increase significantly the range of unstable cells, even for the initially stable cells. an example of this effect is the expansion of the turbulent power spectrum in models 1, 2 and 5 of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in which turbulence is injected on a small scale. the size of this expansion depends on the parameter @xmath0. in these cases, the turbulence expands on large scales with the spreading of perturbations in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, while on the parallel direction it expands only on small scales. the types of the instabilities that can be considered in the icm are the compressible firehose and mirror instabilities, whose role is to a large extent similar to the ones of the non - compressible magnetosonic waves in the mhd model. the mirror instability is responsible for an increase in the acceleration of the particles moving along the field lines. moreover, the cause of the large scale expansion is the tangling of field lines, resulting in an increase of the perpendicular pressure in the local reference frame. although the theoretical prediction of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) could be correct in some cases ( e.g., models with high magnetic field strength and energy dissipation ), our simulations show that mri turbulence in weakly magnetized environments is unable to explain the absence of large scale structure in the power spectrum.
we analysed the hipparcos astrometric data of the stars hosting several candidates for extrasolar planets and derived the best - fit orbits for the low - mass secondaries. we found that the orbits of the selected planet candidates are _ statistically significant _, with a significance of 99 %, if the derived semi - major axis is as small as 2 milli - arc - second, as suggested by han, black & gatewood ( 2001 ). although this conclusion is based on a random choice of the orbital planes, the data can not prove the anisotropy of the orientations of the planet candidates. after showing that the random orientation in space is still a reasonable assumption, not confronted by any available measurement, we present our work ( zucker & mazeh 2001b ) that uses the maxlima maximum likelihood mass algorithm to derive the planet mass distribution. we confirm that we have here two distinct populations, separated by a gap of about one decade in the mass range between 10 and 100 @xmath0. the distance between the gap and the brown - dwarf desert is consistent with the recent finding of halbwachs et al. ( 2000 ), based on the analysis of the high - proper - motion sample of high - precision radial velocity measurements. the two populations are characterized by very different mass distributions, with the giant planets having masses not far from the planetary mass range, while the brown dwarfs are at the stellar mass end. the gap is about 50 % of the mass of the brown dwarf, which is about 10 times larger than the gap. similar to the results of jorrisen, mayor & udry ( 2001a ), we show that the mass distribution of the giant planet candidates is different from that of the secondaries in spectroscopic binaries. this result indicates that we are dealing with two different classes of objects. we compare the periods and eccentricity distributions of the populations. we find that the planets have nearly circular orbits, with periods about 10 - 15 years, which could be the result of a planet dissipation, like in the case of the swarm. the planets in our sample could also be the precursors of the solar system or the planets being too massive. we note, however that this is just a hypothesis, and a more detailed analysis is required to confirm this conjecture.
we make a survey of linear and nonlinear physics of the berk - breizman ( bb ) model, and work on improving our understanding, by using systematic numerical observations, focusing on the frequency sweeping regime. armed with new findings and robust numerical tools, we finally go back to the original problem of resonant interactions between high - energy ions and toroidicity induced alfvn eigenmodes ( taes ), and develop a new method for accurate linear predictions. * background : * the bb model has been very successful in reproducing experimental features of aes for several decades, including confinement efficiencies, cold - bulk distributions, mhd, kinetic theory, tokamak geometry, and particle orbits. hence, to gain a better grasp of the involved hypothesis, we develop a kinetic code to solve the initial - value problem. moreover, we show that the nonlinear time - evolution of chirping in 1d simulations can be used to retrieve information about linear input parameters with good precision. * methods : * using a fokker - planck collision operator, we focus on a regime of quasi - periodical collisions where the resonant frequency grows by many orders of magnitude on a timescale much faster than the equilibrium evolution. this regime is described by a constrained interpolation profile ( cip ) scheme, a locally conservative version of the cip - csl ( hereinafter cip for continuous interpolation ), which is applicable to all the cases mentioned above. by comparing the rate of growth of perturbation to experimental observation, we identify regimes of steady, quasi - periodic, and chaotic nonlinearity. in the last few years, there has been a great interest in the physics of taes. a main reason is that high energy ions can excite plasma instabilities without releasing their energy in the plasma core. furthermore, near a phase - space surface where the resonance condition is satisfied, it is possible to obtain a new set of variables in which the perturbations are described by an effective hamiltonian in 2 conjugated variables @xcite, if we assume an isolated single mode. in this sense, a bb problem is a generalization of the bump - on - tail problem, where we take into account an external wave damping for background dissipative mechanisms, and a collision operator a feature of the nonlinearly evolving nonlinearities, which grows by a factor of 10 - 30@xmath0, with frequency sweeping by 40 - 120 @xmath1
we present a new tidal model for low - mass stars, which constitutes a first step in the endeavor to reconcile two competing tidal formalisms. on the one hand, we base our work on the orbital tidal evolution of planetary systems and take into account the evolution of the star. the model is an equilibrium tide model to account for the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the tides inside the star which is usually taken to be constant throughout the system s evolution ( i.e. the tidal dissipation is due to thermal diffusion and breaking mechanisms acting on gravito - inertial waves ). in the presence of the companion, the planets are falling onto the star in three steps : 1 ) they migrate outward in a tide - like evolution, 2 ) they rotate during their evolution due to the stellar coriolis acceleration, and 3 ) finally, up - spin their stars. we found that the tidal interaction between planets around fast rotating stars causes them to undergo a spurt of orbital evolution. the planets initially interior to the corotation radius can be effectively removed from the star by the stellar spin - up during the pre - main - sequence phase ( and the consequent shrinking of the cotation radius ). the transition from the equilibrium tide to the dynamical tide is abrupt and occurs at a period of about 8 day. among the three falling planets, a planet at an age of 5 gyr is responsible for an spin up of about 2 day with respect to the ` ` normal '' rotation period at that moment. this results in the capture of the planet at the stellar surface and a subsequent transit in a star - planet system. + since the spin and dissipation history of stars strongly influence the dynamics of the planets, we propose to use the currently employed equilibrium tide - induced dissipation as the denominator of the averaged dissipation in order to compare different values of the enveloppes of stars. this means that stellar ages, and the resulting dearth of close - in planets around rapidly rotating stars, can be understood in the context of asteroseismic constraints recently obtained.
we construct starquake models for crab and vela pulsars on the basis of the observational constraint of the glitch healing parameter, @xmath0, and the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium. the crab pulsar is found to be much less compact than the corresponding sphere of homogeneous density distribution, in agreement with the recent upper bound on ns masses by using modern equations of state for ns matter and the properties of light nuclei, consistent with causality and dynamical stability. however, if the crab and the vela are members of the same sequence of the ns models which terminate at the maximum value of ns mass, then we can assign the value of @xmb0, the central weighted mean value of the constant, for the two pulsars respectively, together with the values of central pressure and energy - density, both of the metric parameters, to the extent that the continuity of these quantities at the core - envelope boundary of the model is ensured. accordingly, our study suggests a minimum in the mass of ns as a consequence of the above observational constraints. * upper bounds on neutron star masses * + dimitris antonenko@xmath1, viktor gazdzicki komunitsitsit k, sezione roma ` ` kogane '', 25428 - 2545, japan. + e - mail : antono@kogane.ac.jp _ key words _ : neutron stars ; black holes ; glitches. + biblabel[1]#1. astrophys. j. * # 1 *, # 3. # 1=6em1 # 1 # 1#2#3phys. lett. * b#1 * ( # 2 ) # 3 hep - ph/0209004 a&a # 1 : # 2 + _ einstein - podolsky - rosen institute for nuclear physics, johann wolfgang goethe - str. 1, 85748 garching, germany _ address * ( i ) department of physics and astronomy, ms-108, rice university, p. o. box 1892, + houston, tx 77251 - 1882, usa. + ( ii ) advanced studies center for the early universe ( wise ), nasa / goddard space flight center ( greenbelt ), + sdss 3910, texas a&m. + email : baring@aip.nasa.gov _
i present a model for the interaction of a supernova remnant with a clumpy molecular cloud. in this model, the remnant becomes radiative in the interclump medium and the radiative shells then interact with molecular clumps. the shell expansion is assumed to proceed as in standard shock wave models. when the [ oi ] 63@xmath0 m line is added to the radiation, the shell now has a spectral index that is a factor of @xmath1 higher than the average value for this kind of emission. the nonthermal emission from the other supernova remnants w44, ic 443, and 3c391 is discussed from the same point of view. the radio spectral index is found to be higher in the w44 remnant than in the ic 443 remnant, which supports the interpretation that this source is a remnant in the x - ray cooling phase. a model is proposed for the acceleration of ambient cosmic ray electrons in the shock front of the remnant. the electron acceleration is carried out in parallel to the magnetic field, but perpendicular to the remnant, so that the main part of the acceleration is energy released in the form of shocks. this model can explain a number of observational features, such as the high pressures and velocities observed from these remnants. a comparison of this model to detailed observations of three well - observed remnants shows that the radio emission has not been well fitted by the adiabatic expansion model. the observations show that the emission is close to isothermal, which suggests the action of heat conduction. however the evaporation of clumps does not appear to be a dominant process. i examine the evolutionary status of the remnants. w44 and ic 443 are both ultracompact and show that they can be explained by models in which they are in a cyclical process of expansion into massive stars. ic 443 is similar in age to w44 but has a greater radio luminosity indicating that it is in a younger phase of evolution. a detailed comparison of the models with the observations will be presented in the future.
we present a study of the kinematic structure of the molecular gas in the luminous infrared galaxy ngc7469, based on a combination of high resolution radio co data and near infrared adaptive optics h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) data. the high spatial resolution of the co data taken with the adaptive optics system on the canada - france - hawaii telescope allows us to study the distribution of the gas with respect to the central 0.5 in the plane of symmetry of the galaxy. we find that the gas is kinematically connected to the nuclear ring on scales of 3.2 - 5.5 from the nucleus, and that it is oriented in the same plane as the bar and spiral arms seen in hcn. we therefore reject the possibility that the co and hcn lines trace different parts of the circumnuclear ring, although the latter do show some evidence for an asymmetrical distribution. the difference in position angle between the co ring and the nucleus on the basis of the hcn data is consistent with a bar - driven dynamical instability in the gas, and suggests that the ring and its nuclear ring are not located in a unique position angle @xmath1. the mass distribution in the co radio data is close to spherically symmetric, with both the major and minor axes distinctly non - axisymmetric. we have been able to constrain the mass inside a radius of 0.52.5 of the ring to be less than 4 times the mass of recently formed stars. utilising the scaling of the stellar light component, and using a model for the evolution of the mass surface density as a function of radius which describes the observed in p - v maps of the nuclear region, we derive a total dynamical mass of 6.8mx - 0.7 for the ring. this value is more than a factor of two above the total mass of stars and several times more than the mass in the ring observed in a k - band image of ngc1068, the only galaxy in which has been found to contain a nuclear ring which is strongly detected. the radial mass distribution we find is best described by a model in which accounts for all kinematics features except for the asymmetrical ring. with such a model we can explain the mass - to - light ratio and pah pah inclination of 2.3 in terms of a superposition of stellar and gas components. in particular, it provides a good match to the values found for the 1 -
the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) is of great contemporary interest. the existing experimental results on this process have been summarized and the most relevant pending questions are summarized. the theoretical understanding of this process has been summarized by m. agostini, with particular emphasis on investigations using large water cherenkov detectors. the study of this nuclear species allows us to exclude the occurrence of a transition with half - life smaller than few times @xfig0. that can be probed with a 540kton liquid argon detector and 50kton cubic scintillating muon collider, as a function of the data - taking time. here, we review the present theoretical status of the process and some of the main open questions. in particular, we discuss the general attitude of this field of research and then focus on the issue of measuring neutrino masses. the standard model ( sm ) has been superseded by non - standard models that include non - renormalizable quantum processes that respect the symmetries of the sm, but, nevertheless, violate the lepton number, the quark number, and the baryon number. in these non - perturbative scenarios, the masses of the three known neutrinos are found to be 1/3, 1/2, and 0.5, while the others may have additional masses in the range of 3/2. therefore, we also consider the possibility of discovering other neutrions. there are indications that there may be neutral fermions of all sort, with or without interactions with the quarks and leptons, that could either be bound states of matter ( matter + nucleons ) or, equivalently, of quarks ( or anti - quarks ). in this last case, the oscillation experiments would allow us to distinguish the two classes of particles, i.e., neutral and charged quarks. in view of the above, it is important to consider proton decay, and to determine the ratio, in the search of proton - proton collisions, the neutrinolicity of the decay itself. finally, we emphasize that an accurate measurement of the ratio could also lead to a determination of the primordially generated leptonic lepton number, thereby opening the way to a dynamical explanation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe.
i review the current status of my research on cosmology and inflation, particularly as regards the key questions : where does the matter come from? and what is its origin? as i first described in @xcite, inflation can produce _ almost everything _ from almost nothing? inflation models predict a complicated spacetime with infinitely many variables, some of which may be different from others. the first 25 parameters in table 1 are fairly well - defined within each level ii universe, but the last 5 can vary even between level i universes, depending not only on which potential energy minimum the so - called inflaton field(s ) rolled down into, but also on the path by which it got there. this means that generic inflation models ( all models except ones that are perfectly symmetric around a single unique minimum ) will predict not definite parameter values, but merely a probability distribution as in. moreover, computing this probability distribution for what an observer should expect to be able to measure ( and hence making inflation testable ) requires solving technical problems directly involving the more philosophical - sounding aspects of inflation : 1. the answer depends on the definition of ` ` observer '' ( whether we compute the parameter distribution seen from a random point, a random parallax proportional to the amount of matter seen in diffractionless light seen in response to a random scattering of photons from an external source, e.g. a random galaxy or a random planet ). 2.the answer may depend on pre - inflationary initial conditions. in spite of early difficulties, the daunting problem of how to predict probabilities was successfully overcome in both classical statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, and i am hopeful that inflation will follow suit. 3. can the observed _ matter _ come from _ any _ kind of universe? _ my guess is ` ` yes _, but it comes from _ parallel universes. _ the multiverse has never been more connected to me, and my research question began with the quest for understanding how the cosmic environmental laws have been transformed into a multiverse / multiverse. inflation has began to turn into a more abstract / meta - cosmic physics more than 40 years ago, but never once in the eyes of the empirical / theoretical community, has it been so deeply connected to the basic laws of physics it has become necessary to question the question of where the cosmic laws come from. _ i wish to thank anthony aguirre, anglica de oliveira - costa, martin rees and frank wilczek for inspiring discussions
photometric redshift surveys are currently generating strong constraints on the shape of the primordial power spectrum and the cosmological parameters. in this paper we use a monte carlo approach to model - independent measurements of galaxy distributions from broadband power spectra. we simulate a host of simulated @xmath0 deg@xmath1 galaxy surveys as a function of magnitude and redshift to assess the levels of accuracy with which features in the galaxy power spectrum may be detected, such as acoustic oscillations, the ` turnover'and the turnover. we focus on a particularly simple pair of spectroscopic surveys, the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the sdss-2df _ imaging _ component mapping luminous red galaxies. we find that photometric redshifts provide a powerful instrument for constraining the parameters of the dark energy model, in particular the fraction of baryonic matter in the cosmic microwave background, the running of the spectral index of the power spectrum in terms of luminosity and the density of background galaxies. model - independently, we use the statistics of noise and shot noise contributions to place a lower limit on the uncertainty in the measurement precision of the ` acoustic'scale, as set by the model s best - fit power - spectrum parameters. we compare our detection confidence for the acoustic feature to that for the turnover and find it is only marginally significant at the current detection level. we show that an imaging survey of the entire sdss -2df lrg redshift catalogue may not detect features at larger magnitude or redshift scales at the present time, implying that a much deeper optical database will be required to search for these features at sufficiently small scales. realistic galaxy surveys alone will be able to detect the acoustic features, thus providing an unprecedentedly clean signal - to - noise ratio for measurement precision, with which to discriminate between competing dark energy models. we conclude that galaxy surveys are the best place to look for the first glimpses of any exciting new physics revealed by studies of large - scale structure.
we present a detailed study of the _ s_-process element enrichment of the planetary nebula ngc3918, based on deep, high - resolution ( r@xmath040000 ) optical spectrophotometric data obtained with the uves echelle spectrograph at the vlt. thanks to the high ionization of this object, we detect multiple ionic species of multiple ionization stages. in addition to the _ n_-capture elements, several elements of heavy elements ( e.g., fe, c, n, o, s ) are detected for the first time in the optical range ( @xmath1 log(c / o ) ; the total abundances of these elements are in the range [ fe / o]=0.8 to 1.4, depending on the ionization state assumed. we perform a detailed abundance analysis of the object and its interstellar medium ( ism ). the c / o ratio is much higher ( by about a factor of five compared to the solar value ) than found for other planetary nebulae ( pne ) of comparable luminosity, proving that nitrogen is underabundant in this object. we compute abundances for all species for which atomic data are available, in a sample of 8 pne. as a further increase of accuracy, we present the ionic emission lines of o i, o ii, o iii, o iv, n ii, c iv, c ii and c iii obtained from optical recombination lines under the assumption of the classical cels model atmospheres. for the neutron - capture element lines, we measure emission lines from h, hi, he i and he ii, from which we deduce abundances using the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) models of kr, rb and xe. we identify more than 750 emission lines in the pn ic418, making it one of the deepest spectra of a pn ever taken at such a high spectral resolution. the lines include forbidden lines of several iron - group and other refractory elements, a multitude of permitted features, and a host of diagnostic lines. we discuss our results for a small sample of pne and show that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of current agb models. moreover, we confirm the correlation of [ kr / o ] with the mass of the progenitor star, which, according to theory, is modulated by the nuclear reaction activated in each mass range.
we derive a set of overdamped langevin equations that constrain the dynamics of a group of brownian discs with linear velocity constraints. we apply this to model the collisionless rolling process of macroscopic discs immersed in a fluid or other medium that provides a white noise forcing to the momentum and viscous damping that takes energy and dissipates it into heat or sound, via processes ranging from van der waals and capillary bridges to fracture, plastic and elastic deformations, fracture, and quantum mechanical interactions. the constraints imply an equal number of degrees of freedom, so the system is well - described by a one - parameter family of equations. we derive the lagrange multipliers that ensure the constraints are satisfied, and use this to determine the angle distribution of the trimer of discs so that it does not move in the tangent direction despite being strongly constrained. this is a different result from forced brownian motion in configuration space, but it is similar in spirit to when constraints are absent. this provides a method to determine experimentally whether friction is present for a given type of particle, and we show that if so, the constraint - free energy of the system changes its free energy. more generally, this work provides another way in which constraints can be used to test the mechanical principles of cold dark matter analogs of thermodynamic theories, such as the fluctuation - dissipation theorem. we also discuss how imposing constraints on velocity can change the shape of rolling systems, which can yield insight into the geometry and mechanics of nonequilibrium dissipative forces and mechanical metamaterials, and into the nature of phase transitions and angular distributions. the pursuit for clean, mechanical systems has led to a long and frustrating history @xcite. it is known, for example, that the boltzmann belt effect results from trying to describe the thermodynamic behavior of heterogeneous materials where the free energy is the sum of two terms, independent of the details of the material ( e.g. the material s curvature or shear strain ), and that it arises from the interactions between the constituents. the physical phenomenon we aim to model is different from that of classical statistical mechanics, in that we consider a system of particles interacting with very strong dry friction. such forces are known to give rise to an intrinsically nonlinear response to white - noise forcing, and therefore are difficult to model accurately, even considering hydrodynamic interactions. yet they do lead to a dissipative force that mimics the effects of rolling, including a scaling of the
we discuss various properties of wavelets in the duality pairing of a locally compact abelian group with a discrete group, acting as an automorphism of the group. we particularly discuss a construction in which the dilation operator and the translation operator are dual, in a manner to be compared to haar measures on the fundamental domain of the lattice. we also provide a natural generalization of the shannon wavelet in a similar setup with dilation operators and translation operators, and apply it to show that the wavelet is isomorphic to the compact group @xmath0, which is a topological homeomorphism from a local group to the universal group. many groups are known to be automorphisms of local groups, and it is natural to ask whether one can restrict oneself to small classes of those groups. katz and magnus proved that if a compact group acts on a local relative group in a certain way, then the associated group is amenable to study in more sophisticated ways. the extended haar / shannon phenomenon has become a central theme in the study of local group actions in algebraic geometry and topology. the well - known haar wavelet @xcite is an excellent example. in a standard treatment, one does not have to rely on the isolated existence of discrete subgroups to derive an invariant measure on the group ; one can, instead, build an extensive set of invariant measures by simply adding magnitudes of explicit functions of the fundamental groups. an obvious generalization to many groups is to consider local groups acting on local groups. there has been much effort invested in such contexts, both in terms of fundamental group theories ( that is, to borrow a term from haar measure studies of matrices ), and in order to model generic problems ( large-@xmath1 quantum groups ), as well as problems of algebraic systems ( see, for instance, *??? * example 1.1 ). of course the usual approach to the latter is to insist on a one - to - one correspondence between the underlying group and the various groups ; however, it is not a straightforward procedure to construct generic quotients, and even then, one may be led to conclude that one should question whether one should bother, given the complexity of the problem, whether it is justified to bother, as is the case with respect to completely natural choices of natural groups. the purpose of this note is to point out a phenomenon which was recently the subject of an interesting and imprecise study
we develop a thermodynamic approach of adsorption - desorption process in porous systems. this approach takes into account the elastic deformation of the porous matrix which is the origin of the hysteretic behavior of the system. in particular, we show that the surface free energy, which represents an inertial barrier in the adsorbate - solid interface, is proportional to the elastic constant of the solid and is deformed when the pressure is reduced. this deformation deforms the solid in a way similar to the avalanche phenomena observed in porous glass. finally, we give an analysis of the effect of the porosity size distribution and of the boundary hysteresis loop, both of which are connected by a third - dimensional network of interconnected pores of almost cylindrical shape and same size. = 1.cm = -0.5 cm = -1 mm = 23.2truecm 40 pt plus 1000pt minus 100pt # 1 # 1= to # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * ( # 3 ) # 4 = 15 # 1texas a & m university burlington, british columbia, uk + e - mail : quinn@aj.org.uk + @xmath0-department of physics and department of mathematics, franklin and marshall college, p. o. box 1892, new york, ny 10027#1#2_chemistry de physique thorique _ universit de paris xi, btiment 210, f-91405 orsay cedex, france + e-mail : dphc@europhys.univ-paris-xi.fr * # 1 *, # 3 ( # 2 ) = 11 # 1 = by60 = cmbx10 scaled2 = cmmbx9 scaled2 # 1section [ sec:#1 ] # 1to 0pt#1 _ accepted for publication in phys. rev. d.
we demonstrate that compression of image data using lossless or lossy data compression techniques is competitive in terms of compression performance when the code is lossy. in the lossless compression of multidimensional data, the kolmogorov minimal sufficient statistic is often used to separate the signal - to - noise ratio and the entropy of the noise into deterministic and stochastic components. we present scaling relations analogous to maximum likelihood estimation, thereby enabling the dichotomy between these two commonly used methods of analyzing data. image compression has a long and successful history, and can be seen as a descendant of information - losing and lossy compression techniques. it is well known that shannon entropy and the shannon information entropy formula establish a lower bound on the rate of data compression across a channel - no algorithm can produce a compression algorithm whose average codeword length is less than that expected from the given set of codewords. in many practical situations, however, the output length of the compression algorithm is not known exactly what the minimum information contained in the code ; it may be large, noisy, or even non - deterministic, in nature. in these cases, the entropy or other measures of entropy may not be easily accessible. we address this issue by introducing a new method of characterizing the complexity of deterministic processes, based on the hessian of the hartley information. in contrast to the chaitin s algorithmic prefix complexity, this metric measures the shortest path to the maximal possible decompression length, and is not directly related to the bremsstrahlung entropy. we name this new method after the well - known binary codes, namely lempel - ziv. as such, it is analogous to the monte carlo code of choice. it has been in use today as a source code for image decompression, although it is probably easier to use for commercial purposes. the new method has two important advantages. first, it eliminates the need for binary codes altogether. it avoids the slowing down of data that are lost in the compression process, and it provides an environment where non - trivial differential equations may be readily recovered. second, it enables the separation of the two - part coding code into a deterministic classical code and a random noise component. as with any deterministic process, this can be incorporated into the statistical models of the data, since the loss occurs at the level of the residual noise function. we use a hard differential equation to determine the performance of the algorithm, and we compare the
we explore the redshift space correlation function of dark matter halos in configuration space and use @xmath0-body simulations to model it as a function of halo bias. in order to model the distortions which result from the clustering of galaxies in redshift surveys, we take a non - perturbative approach and employ a scale - dependent gaussian streaming model, which describes the galaxy pairwise velocity distribution in fourier space but not the corresponding real space matter correlation function. we review the linear and quasilinear description of redshift - space distortions and use it to describe the characteristics of the tracer pairs velocity fields in terms of pairwise velocities and dispersions. we set out the challenges for the linear theory and demonstrate that even though linear perturbation theory contains small - scale non - linearities which are important to match the measurements of galaxy anisotropies and correlations, if we assume a constant, isotropic velocity dispersion for our tracer tracers, this does not alter the conclusions on their own. we incorporate linear as well as non - linearly dependent corrections into the formalism ; in particular, we allow the velocity dispersions to vary with angle and independently account for the position angle of the line - of - sight to halos. this allows us to model _ real space _ distortions as a transformation between clustering and velocity statistics and to determine the role of bias in the shape. we find that the real space halo correlation function is nearly unbiased at the 2 per cent level and is well reproduced by our model. however, the model is highly sensitive to a second - order transition to a linearly biased tracer regime if the pair separation is steep, i.e., halos are over - projected relative to the average pair separation. we show that the linear prediction of our model is not robust under the assumption that the peculiar velocity field amplitude from tracers of the matter density field is the same for all halo masses and that the infall velocity of halos is independent of bias. we present a simple fisher matrix calculation which accurately reproduces the fisher matrix results of the ongoing baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey.

using our 1.2deg@xmath0 narrow - band imaging survey of the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) and the noao mayall and blanco-4 m telescopes, we are discovering rare, intermediate size and luminosity ly@xday0 blobs over an area of @xmath1. our previous sensitivity and selection criteria are comparable to that of the largest previous blob survey ( *??? * ). we discover 25 lyrexcite blobs in the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ). of these 25, six are detected only in one survey field, the concordance field, while the remaining 16 blobs are mostly undetected in the other four fields. using a custom narrowband filter, we obtain deep narrowband images of these superbubbles and measure their size distribution and fluxes. we first constrain their number density, clustering, and large - scale environment using a large volume cosmological n - body simulation. the median observed field - to - field variance for the bright / large blobs ( halo number density 150 % ) is 90 %. we find that the clustering of blobs is significantly non - gaussian and that the distribution of luminosity and spatial extent is bimodal ( i.e., brighter / larger blobs have larger clustering ). using the spatial extent and line widths of the lines of sight, we estimate the dark matter halo masses of the blobs and find that their host dark halos have masses in the range 0.510.0@xcite - 0.050.0003. we compare the blob number counts with the high - resolution images of @xcite to constrain the host halo mass distribution calculated from cosmology. we conclude that the large mass probed by our survey is not consistent with the small - scale clustering inferred from studies of halo properties in the local group. we also use our blob number density and clustering to correct for the dominant contribution from agn activity in blobs, suggesting that the agn do not significantly contribute to the lyman continuum. combining our results with other studies, we predict that the surface density of lyrexmath2 blobs will increase substantially with cosmic time. based on a simple analytic approximation for the underlying fluctuations in the number density distribution, we calculate that the average blob surface density ( as measured per square degree ) in any of the fields studied could be underestimated by less than 0.5 % ( 4 @
* how can one estimate the infection probability of a given population, given the presence of other infectious agents in the vicinity, while controlling the spread of the epidemic? * here, we develop an analytical framework, based on spectral information, to address this question. we do this by considering a restricted group of individuals, i.e. individuals who have been infected with an infectious disease recently. these individuals are assumed to be randomly located in the network, and we assume that the epidemic s spread is entirely dominated by the dominant modes of the network. our analytical framework reveals that the prevalence of epidemics is necessarily dominated by a small number of dominant modes, while the effective number of degrees of freedom is much smaller than the system size. the proposed method practically limits the expanse of mitigation policies such as targeted vaccination, and provides specific alerts by following the spreading trail of infection. * several recent studies have demonstrated that contact information of individuals plays a crucial role in epidemic spreading @xcite. one study analysed the percolation - like transition and the scaling relation of the giant cluster component size ratio as @xmath0, showing that the disease dynamics largely depends on the mobility pattern of individuals. in another study, intensity maps of some infectious agents were obtained by using stochastic simulations as input, and the results were used to develop mitigation and control policies. in the present article, we address the question whether the analysis of mobility data can be used to automatically estimate the spreading rate, and how this can be distinguished from other analysis methods. our main aim is to provide a framework that can describe the overall infection risk in proximity networks, which appear in various forms of transportation and infrastructure networks, and that can also elucidate the nature of epidemic spreading. * since many modern society has developed its ways of surviving and thriving in the digital age, it is important to have a better grasp of the general processes that govern the evolution of a population, in particular. mobility data have been used to generate annual census of people flow in various locations around the world, and to investigate the topology of human interactions. data such as those based on human mobility have also provided valuable information about the disease spreading in populations in different geographical regions, such as urban areas or long - range travel patterns. in addition, these data have made it possible to develop models and analysis that accurately disentangle the epidemic mechanisms. *
the distribution of the squashing degree, @xmath0, in the vicinity of magnetic nulls and quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) is analysed in terms of the field line mapping between positive and negative polarity regions of the photosphere. in particular, we consider the case of a single null point in a separatrix dome configuration. this structure is topologically stable, since magnetic flux from each polarity region connects to other flux patches of opposite polarity. the field lines radiiate away from ( or approach ) the null point via a discontinuous, rotational asymmetric structure known as the _ spine _ and _ fan _ field lines. we examine the distribution of contours of linear field lines around the spine and fan footpoints, and relate this to the known features of current accumulation and magnetic reconnection around these nulls. for a coronal magnetic null point the extent of field line slippage is of the order of the spine - fan distance, when the field strength is zero and the eigenvalues of the largest fan eigenvalue are zero. when the strength is non - zero, field lines form a halo of continuous field, which rotates and has strong gradients at the spine / fan boundary. this halo has an aspect ratio of 5, which is beyond the range of current layer observations. we model the halo as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) superposition of regions of distinct polarity, in which the regions of highest current accumulation / reconnection intensity are also superimposed. each region of these regions contains a unique x - ray flare ribbon associated with the footprint of the separatrix surface of the magnetic null. we show that the location of these ribbons depends sensitively on the geometries of the underlying field lines and the null - point geometry. in the cases where the null is _ hyperbolic _, so is the section of field lines along the spine, the displays of circular flare ribbons can be interpreted as the reconnection regions being shifted to higher aspect ratios. on the other hand, the presence of a finite - size separatrix layer can mask the expected location of the ribbons.
we present the analysis of an _ hubble space telescope _ and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) fuv spectrum of the qso he02264110 ( @xmath0 ) covering nearly continuously the wavelength range from 916 to 1730. the line - of - sight to the galaxy hosts a numerous population of metal - line absorbers, indicating that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is enriched in metals from several ionization stages. we use these observations to study the origin(s ) of the observed o@xmath1vi systems in the igm. combining them with measurements of other qso spectra from the literature, we find that 1 out of 5 systems seen in the uv spectra can be explained as photoionized interstellar medium ( ism ) clouds, assuming a photoionization model with a 1/2 solar metallicity. the probable origin of the remaining 4 systems is collisional ionization, although this explanation is not confirmed by our observations. we demonstrate that the abundance and kinematics of the low - equivalent - width ( m / l ) lyman limit systems can be well explained by simple ionization models if n / o is sub - solar, but the observed column densities can also be explained by a simple photoionizing model with relative solar abundance. for the systems without clear origins, we suggest that the abundant species ne, o, and ne are probably primarily ionized by the ism clouds, whereas c, n, and o are likely to be ionizers of the nearby ism. the observed ionization conditions for the majority of the systems are similar to those found in our previous analysis of the high - quality stis stis data. using these and previous sight lines in conjunction with _ fuse _ and _ fuse_/stis data, we report the discovery of several new systems along the line of sight that can be conclusively classified as tentative agb systems. we examine the ionic and physical properties of these systems using single - state and double - double - singlet ionic models. we also discuss the prospects of using the observations to determine the physical properties and abundances of the baryons in the tenuous igm in the low redshift universe.
we present extensive submillimeter continuum photometry and maps revealing the warm and cold dust around the young star - forming regions i16293a, b and i 16293e out of the dense dark core at the center of the ldn 1689n cloud. we report the detection of the ground - state lines of hdo and h@xmath0, the molecular species responsible for the fractionation of deuterated species in the gas phase, as well as weak hdo emission toward the young prestellar object ( class @xmath1i ) i1623293e. our hdo continuum data are combined with pointed observations of co in the extended envelope of the prestellar core i1629e to determine the density and temperature structure throughout the envelope. the hdo data are compared with predictions from a simple chemical network and the observations are used to constrain the infall parameters of the core. we find that for a young stellar object such as i1627a the outflow velocity is of order of 50, which is sufficient to explain the observed hdo line profiles and to cause a significant deuteration of the molecular gas. the total hdo abundance in the core is about 0.2 times solar. we also find that the density structure of the disk, envelope, and outflow can qualitatively be explained by a single outflow model with a turbulent velocity of 2.3 km s_s$xmath10 and an outflow inclination of 6.2. the excitation analysis of the innermost regions of the outer envelope regions indicates a depletion of co by a factor of 10 relative to the ` standard'abundances. our deep co mapping shows that the core also has a second outflow, a so called e w flow, with a dynamical time scale of 7 yr. the origin of the e w outflow is discussed based on the evolutionary stage of this new outflow. we argue that this core may hide a second class of protostellar core, a(b ) class 0 object which is deeply embedded in a largely unaffected cold core. this cold core may have been formed in the early stages of the star formation, prior to the freeze - freeze phase of the protostar forming system. hdo observations indicate the presence of a cold condensation in the heart of the coldest part of the warm envelope, where hdo is dominant. the warm gas in the cold core is consistent with having been desorbed from the grains in a slow shock driven by the older nw
we present the most comprehensive scuba vla and atca observations of @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies to date. we detect 20 grb host galaxies in the sub - mm and radio bands, and detect 20 additional sources in the uv / optical. this feat is enabled by the combination of large and unbiased observations from these bands, allowing a major re - measurement of the star formation history of the local universe. we find that the detections are generally of low statistical significance, with only 4 out of a possible 21 sources in our sample detected in at least one of three bands ( _ i _ ). this is in contrast to the few detections that have been reported in the optical and near - ir thus far. the frequency distribution of the detected host galaxies is found to be bimodal, with brighter hosts having a larger range in redshift. we determine the fraction of local star formation rates ( sfrs ) in the host galaxies, and find that although there is no single significant high sfr detection in this sample, there is strong evidence that very massive host galaxies are relatively well - obscured. we estimate that among the 18 hosts with measured redshifts, 10 - 25 % are likely obscured, while the remainder are most likely not significantly dust - obscured, with a sfr of a few m@xmath1. we thus conclude that only a small fraction of star formation takes place in galaxies that are both red and dust - free, a conclusion that is similar to that based on studies of optically - selected lyman break galaxies and other star - forming galaxies. we present an estimate of the overall star formation rate in grb hosts, finding that it is lower by about an order of magnitude compared to radio pre - selected and optically selected galaxies. this result is in agreement with predictions from models for the evolution of either the initial mass function ( e.g. supernovae ) or the black hole growth history. however, it may be indicative of a bias towards less dust obscuration if the majority of grb galaxies are ultra - luminous galaxies with very high star - formation rates, or a biased population of lower luminosity galaxies with low star forming galaxies.
we report on a new maximum likelihood method to fit time - resolved periodogram data showing the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of high - mass x - ray binary u. the method enables the unbiased estimation of the qpo parameters ( frequency, width and amplitude ) on timescales down to about 20 seconds, when the noise level is significantly higher than the frequency resolution. the results are compared with previously published results and verified through monte carlo simulations. the method is applied for the first time to _ rxte _ data, and the results show that it is significantly more reliable and accurate than standard 2-finite periodogram fitting, which typically gives biased parameters with larger uncertainties when applied to such short time series. the technique is also shown to be consistent with random walks, and is shown to provide a significant improvement in terms of both reliability and accuracy compared with existing methods. future applications of this method include the analysis of variability of high frequency broad band pds from long _ xmm - newton _ observations, and modeling of solar oscillation spectra. 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 m. a. nielsen and i. l. chuang, ` ` a theory of qpo variability, '' astrophys. j. * 136 *, 319333 ( 2005 ). a. n. pala, j. j. vu@xmath0 stars : individual : u auroralis, l. davidovich, s. pauchy, e. serebryakov, a. dzardanov, y. kivshar, pacs numbers : 05.45.+r, 11.10.-s, 12.38.bx, 14.80.ly [ firstpage ] methods : statistical stars : accretion, accretion discs, x - rays : binaries, stars : oscillations
we study the behavior of large discrete time regulatory gene expression networks defined on both the homogeneous and the scalable maximal graphs. the former are built upon the regular and random arrays of piecewise linear and logistic discrete time coupled maps studied extensively in the last decade, while the latter are modeled by the coupled map lattice model. starting from a fixed initial conditions, we have shuffled these switching parameters randomly and then randomized the initial conditions for a given layout of thresholds and interaction signs in the given network. the dynamical behavior observed in such a system crucially depends upon the topology of underlying maximal graph including all possible interactions of genes in the network. we have found that the parameter @xmath0, that is, the ratio of the positive to negative interactions allowed between genes, is a convenient parameter that can be used to distinguish between different classes of regulatory networks. in the case of homogeneous regulatory networks, when the positive interaction between genes is dominant in the system, its dynamical behaviors is dominated by the _ positive feedback circuits _ responsible for a number of asymptotically stable fixed points ( fixed points ), at the same time the influence of negative feedback circuits onto the long time behavior of system is negligible. the number of these fixed points is essentially determined by the interaction threshold values. the structure of active active domain in the regulatory network settled at a fixed point is similar to that of the random graph of erds and rnyi @xcite, in the sense that the active domain has the same occupancy number as the corresponding random graph. furthermore, the synchronous oscillations of the network oscillations may persist for a suitable for the specific network topology, if the scale free graph can be considered as undirected. the increase of percentage of negative interactions increases the degree of the oscillating domains in accordance with the power law statistics of the deterministic state shown by calculating the occupancy numbers of the consequent intervals of phase space for different network nodes. the large scale free graphs have shown recently the similar dynamics of local agent spreading and the effective bidirectional interactions among the genes, if certain fraction of nodes has been added to the network, in particular, the local dynamics spanned by a factor of few is described by the logarithm of the excess number of nodes for a large class of networks. the present paper proposes a ` ` mean field '' approach to the large regulatory networks with randomly shuffled thresholds of type interactions between genes and their interaction signs. it can be viewed as a simulation study of the
the wigner - seitz ( w - s ) approximation is compared with the full band theory for the neutron star crust. in the former case the energy spectrum of the unbound neutron gas is continuous while in the latter case it is discrete due to the spherical symmetry of the crystal lattice. as a result the level density is found to be a highly degenerate function of the particle number and a tracer of the fermi wavelength. we have used the gilat - raubenheimer method to estimate the value of the effective neutron mass in the outermost layers of the inner crust where the nuclear clusters are not perturbed by the binding potential of the neutrons. it is shown that the spatial extent of the bound states is very small in this region. the single particle wave functions of unbound neutrons are qualitatively well reproduced by this theory whereas those of bound states in the hartree - fock approximation with skyrme forces are expected to be substantially different. the comparison has also revealed that the ground state properties of the neutron gas, like the neutron density distribution, are strongly affected by boundary conditions outside the clusters although the impact on the average baryon density is small. + pacs number(s ) : 04.60.fv, 04.65.+e, 42.50.+h, 43.40.+j, 41.10.+q 2 a recent study has shown that in the inner regions of the bhb@xmath0 model of the crust, close to the core of a neutron star, bound states are important in determining the equation of state, ( _ i.e. _ the mass, momentum and magnetic field ). according to the floquet - bloch theorem, states are related to wave functions which are obtained by solving the self - consistent equations for the occupation of single particles by means of the wave functions or potentials. the occupied nucleon single particle levels are however discrete and obey @xmath1-space which implies that the energy spectra are composed of a series of sheets or bands ( or bands " in neutron terminology ) separated by a density gradient. the band theory gives an estimate of the contribution ( [ hk ] ) of these 3d bands to the neutron energy spectrum. it should be mentioned that the 3d band theory is only used to describe the very dense matter in the core part of massive stars which is the domain of extreme heavy element abundance in supernova explosions. + keywords : stars : neutron,
we report x - ray imaging and spectroscopy of the field of the short - duration gamma - ray burst grb050509b and its afterglow. a 3@xmath0 upper limit on the burst duration is given by @xmath1 s, and the 0.3 m rotse - i experiment has been used to find a limiting magnitudes for the well - characterized interstellar medium in this source. with the wiyn 3.5 m telescope on may 9, we obtain two exposures totaling 360 s at 0.14 resolution. when combined with the esi imaging at 8.17 d, a catalog of about 2000 sources can be produced. we analyze this data in conjunction with the _ swift _ archive to study the position of the xrt source and to examine its variability. the catalog includes optical, near - infrared, and radio data from the literature. we place constraints on the morphology of this source of 0.2 m, 2.8 m, and 4.9 m, respectively. we find that it is centered at the redshift of the clusters g1 and g2, in the same location of the elliptical galaxy ngc 4151. if the long - duration grbs are all created by the collapse of a neutron star binary ( ns ns ) or a black hole, then this galaxy must be at at least 0.22, one of the fainter cluster members. this localization is consistent with the notion of short bursts being produced by collapsar stars in the nuclei of massive galaxies. we also find that the energy ejected by the outflow is subluminous compared to the average value for short grbs by at least two orders of magnitude. this may indicate that the short bursts are not prompt tracers of star formation as with the collapsar scenario. given the lack of evidence for recent star formation in the host galaxy, we explore the alternative hypothesis of a quiescent magnetar in the immediate vicinity of a cluster. if this is the case, the supernova or supernova emission would have to be suppressed by field stars or megaflare activity, otherwise it would violate the local stellar population law.
the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) is a promising solution to provide perpetual power supplies for energy demanding or energy constrained wireless networks such as. besides other well known environmental sources such as wind and solar, ambient radio signals can be a viable new source for energy harvesting. as a result, a unified study on swipt has drawn significant attention, which is not only theoretically intricate but also practically valuable for enabling both the wireless data and wireless energy access to mobile terminals at the same time. in this paper, we consider a practical design of the miso broadcast system for swipt, where a multi - antenna access point ( ap ) transmits simultaneously to multiple single - antenna receivers each of which implements opportunistic information decoding ( i d ) versus energy harvesting ( eh ) over quasi - static channels, when the channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter is not necessarily positive semidefinite. we investigate two types of i d receivers, namely type i and type ii i d free - space radio signals, which do not yet possess and possess the capability of cancelling the interference due to energy signals, respectively. the main goal of our work is to jointly design the joint information and energy beamforming design to maximize the weighted sum - power transferred to all eh receivers subject to a given set of signal - to - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraints. we first formulate the jointly optimal solutions to the non - convex transmit beamforming optimization problem for two i d receiver types by applying an optimization technique so - called ` ` global optimal beamforming '' ( sdr ), whereby the energy beam employing no dedicated energy beam is optimal. it is known that sdr is an efficient approach to obtain good approximate solutions in general, in particular, for the dual multiple - access - channel ( bc ) with equivalent noise at the receiver, and the related uplink - downlink duality, and proposed a new principle termed ` ` ` opportunistic energy harvesting '' where the receiver switches between harvesting energy and decoding information based on the wireless link quality and interference condition. by applying this new duality result, we develop alternative algorithms based on iterative uplink and downlink transmit optimization to obtain the same optimal solutions as by sdr. next, in order to gain further insight to the optimal energy and information beamforming designs, we reformulate the information - theoretic standpoint of swipt in miso, and propose a receiver location based transmission scheduling, where receivers close to the ap are scheduled for eh while those more far apart from the
the discovery of long - lasting x - ray afterglow emission from several gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with the bepposax satellite and related optical and radio transients has provided a major boost to both observations and theoretical investigations of grbs over the last few months. with the new capability to point the narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) towards grb positions, the distribution of grb sources along the galactic plane has revealed a significant isotropy in the intensity distribution of n(@xmath0-ray ) sources. this isotropy has been verified with observations of several well - localized grbs, and has been used to establish an accurate position accuracy for the detected grbs. since 1991, almost every detectable location of a grb has been observed with the wfc, asca, rosat and asca detectors. the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory has detected about 8 grbs per year, and several more have been localized in 1997. the average exposure times with asca ( rosat ) are 1.2 ( 5 ) days, which is near the minimum possible time achievable due to the various scheduling constraints. if grbs are at cosmological distances, their isotropy on the sky is a natural consequence. the basic mechanisms for the emission of x - rays have been proposed, and so far there is no single model which successfully fits all results of observations. the most likely scenario for the origin of the afterglows is the dissipative ( shock ) model of meszaros & rees ( 1993, 1997 ). several variants of this basic scenario have been discussed, and the most successful one is that of synchrotron or inverse compton cooling from a decelerating relativistic shell ( piro 1998a ). the simple fireball model can not fit all observations, and an external shock is the best fit ( feroci 1998, 1999 ). in particular, the connection between the energy spectral slope and the slope of the intensity decay curve is most easily reconciled if the grb emission is isotropic, although the emission can not be more than a few kev. other possible scenarios, such as accretion of matter from hypernova remnants, or emission from the aftermath of the binary merger ( paczynski & zarzynski 1998 ), have failed to account for the observations. it is likely that a more complex shock model is necessary in order to explain the observed properties of the low - energy emission. # 1#
we analyze the high resolution spectra of three m dwarfs, namely gj273, gj725b, and gj6406 observed with adaptive optics at kitt peak. we use the pseudo - continuum defined by the molecular veil opacities to provide a reference in comparison with the observed spectrum, which is usually evaluated by referring to the true continuum. we show that such an analysis can be avoided owing to the high effective area of these spectra. then we apply the spectral synthesis ( ss ) method to evaluate accurately the theoretical spectrum of the m dwarf. we find that the ss method works well in replacing many of the spectral lines by ones of stable molecules such as co and h@xmath0. in particular, the carbon abundances in late - type stars can be determined by the use of co as the abundance indicator, contrary to the general belief that such a method can not be applied in cool stars. given that the difficulty due to the depressed continuum is overcome, abundance analysis of m dwarf stars offers a unique opportunity which is not realized in other spectral types. we emphasize the importance of the fundamental stellar parameters such as atmospheric parameters, model photospheres, and molecular data for this analysis. we then examine the necessary data and tools for spectroscopic analysis carried out with the underlying principle of co abundance. we demonstrate that by employing the method, it is possible to determine accurate abundances of carbon and oxygen to a high accuracy. as an example, we compare our results with the metallicities determined from the infrared spectra in the @xmath5 band region by @xcite based on the fourier transform spectrometer at kpno. we confirm the difference of 0.26 dex in oxygen abundance between the two models. also, the method of evaluating the carbon abundance available in the galaxy can be applied to estimate the metallicity of earth - type planets which may be able to harbor habitable planets. finally, we propose to extend the study to the yet unsettled problem of the yet low solar carbon abundance.
non - lte hydrogen column ( @xmath0 ) models of white dwarf atmospheres absorbing hydrogen using lte spectra have been used to probe the spatial distribution of supersoft x - ray sources in the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ). by comparing with the mass distributions obtained from these models a white dwarf mass distribution is derived for the m31 galaxy. a sub - sample of 16 sources ( dubbed the supper - white sample ) with white dwarf masses in excess of 0.90@xmath1 is identified where the hydrogen column is consistent with a 12 - 16 kpc spiral arm of m31. this sample is used to check the consistency with the galactic bulge and disk bulge mass distribution as derived by kahabka ( 1998 ). the supersoft mass distribution can be compared with the predictions from population synthesis calculations assuming that only a fraction of 6.0 % of the population in the hydrogen - burning shell approximation explodes as type ia supernovae. assuming no mass degeneracy the following results are obtained : ( i ) the distribution of the cumulative number of supernova rates in m31 is derived ; ( ii ) a mean scale height of the sample is derived which is in agreement with the expected detection limit in the expected exposure time of the observations ( 100 - 150 pc at 5 kpc ) and ( iii ) a normalization of the luminosity function to the milky way is required in order to match the observed distribution of bolometric luminosities to the predicted one. the wolf - rayet star luminosity functions ( lte ) in supersoft sources are used to constrain the number of brown dwarfs. a supernova rate of a few per cent of the light elements ( i.e. nuclei ) exploding as a part of a supersoft population with a typical life time of about 5.5 to 6.5 years has been derived for this sample. this rate is large enough to make a significant contribution to the sn ia rate in the spiral galaxy. assuming that every supersoft source obeys the standard salpeter ( or scalo ) supernova survival rule and that no supernova is occurred on a timescale shorter than about 1 - 2 years, a normalisation for the supernova frequency in the galaxy is estimated to be about 1.5 per cent. the predicted distribution of presoft sources close to the galaxy disk and in the more spatially extended regions of its halo are consistent with the observed supersoft star count rates. the population size in the
using the binary reaction trigger spectrometer ( brs ) in conjunction with the euroball iv ( eb ) @xmath0-_batron tandem facility of strasbourg, we have studied the deformed shapes and the energies of the quasimolecular resonances observed in the nuclear superdeformation bands ( hd ) of the @-1mg+@xmath2c ( open rectangles ) and @-6o+_transfer _ reactions at 0.309.0 mev in a search for true ternary fission components. for both reactions the brs, in its current configuration, provides a unique tool for the study of nuclei at large deformations. of particular interest is the relationship between superdeformations and clusters in the ion - ion potential, which at high excitation energies are known to be associated with clustering phenomena. by using a two - dimensional spectrum obtained with a mask and performing a careful analysis of the fragment angular distributions we have identified the most probable escape peak positions of the 6.13 mev, 6.92 mev and 7.12 mev ` ` power - bands '' from the @xcite brs spectra. we have also identified a possible escape peak at 7.25 mev from a brs / eb exposure. euroball has provided us with the first experimental evidence for the new brs partial level scheme by measuring the intensity and the decay energy of the 4.4 mev brs beam with a high enough s / n in a kinematical coincidence. thanks to the wealth of data obtained in terms of binary and non - binary spectra obtained with this new technique, we can now investigate the most important combinations of light nuclei in the energy range from 1.1 mev up to 162 mev where it has been previously possible only to study binary transitions only. in particular, complete out - of - plane angular correlations have been observed for the @x0-transfer reaction at a beam energy of 163.5 mev. the results are in good agreement with the predictions from the generalized liquid - drop model. the obtained fragment energies and the associated hd bands are in excellent agreement with those obtained using previously determined hd resonant effects in n = z nuclei.
in paper i, we have carried out an exhaustive study of the evolution of the early universe, corresponding to the transition from the matter era to the radiation era, by a single equation of state of the form @xmath0, where the term ` ` early '' refers to thermal fluctuations and the ` ` late '' to the late. in the present paper, we continue that study. we consider the case of the inflationary universe. in particular, we obtain a model of late universe, equivalent to the anti - cyclic universe, that exists eternally in the past and is non - singular in the future. this model exhibits a phase of early and late inflation. although this model is independent of observations, our results reveal a subtle symmetry between the early and the late universe. specifically, for a large range of the parameters of the model, the planck temperature and the cosmological density represent fundamental upper and lower bounds. these bounds are responsible for an existence of the extra - dimensional universe described by this model. in addition, our study leads to a new type of primordial singularity, which corresponds to an aioniotic universe that has an infinite radius ( infinite temperature corresponding to infinite density ) and no singularity ( singularity ). our results may be relevant for the formulation of the unified description of the pre - radiation and the radiation eras. in a previous paper [ arxiv:1303.07175, f.h.- j. kim et al., fukuda, astron. astrophys. * # 1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1#2#3nucl. phys. * b#1 * ( # 2 ) # 3 # 1 # 2#3phys. lett. b # 1*b#1*(#2 ) # three # 1=6pt pacs indices : 05.30.ch, 98.80.-k, 11.10.gh the universe is an enigmatic entity that has defied our attempts to understand its origin and has defied all attempts to establish a coherent picture of the universe. despite the impressive efforts made to locate and study this enigmatic object, there is still a deep understanding of its role in the formation of our universe. a large part of the complexity of the problem of describing the universe may be understood as a result of the decoupling of a priori different forces, the interplay between them being responsible for the warm dark matter era and the dark energy era. this phenomenon appears to be universal, in the
we extend our previous analysis of the evolutionary history of black - hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) by including constraints on the pre - sn binary properties and the kick velocity that may have been imparted to the bh at birth. using the most recent set of observational constraints for groj1655 - 40 ( 1655 ) we map out the 3-dimensional parameter space of bh and donor masses, orbital period, and binary eccentricity to reconstruct the past evolutionary history from the present stage right before the core collapse event. as a result, we identify the time intervals for which the h - r diagram and the mass - period plane are satisfied, and identify the parts of the parameter space that might have differed in the onset of supernova ( sn ) kicks and that led to anomalous bh masses or orbital periods that are still inconsistent with the current observational constraints. by considering donor star masses that are significantly lower than the minimum - mass m - star limit and adopting a modified form for the critical - to - main - sequence ( mt ) sequences, we find that low initial donor masses and longer initial orbital periods are necessary to be successful. however, the trend in the successful mt sequences that adopt an eccentricity @xmath0 toward the beginning of the sn phase indicates that the post - sn orbital period and eccentricity can be altered by secular changes in the external gravitational field and that the resulting bh mass and distance changes are subject to secular variations as well. we therefore conclude that it is not necessary to find all possible sequences to find a successful bh xrb, but instead to map the outline of their initial parameter space, which must satisfy all observationally inferred properties ( i.e., the mass ratio, the stellar radius, the longitude, and the galactic longitude ). the donor mass is shown to be extremely under - bounded by the current constraints. in turn this provides a constraint on the amount of circumstellar material that could have been ejected during the sn explosion, which may explain why the donor star in this system is significantly below the star formation threshold.
we show that the fraction of galaxies that are blue ( the ` ` butcher oemler effect '' ) is very similar to that of the star - forming fraction, although there are certainly some galaxies in clusters that appear to be undergoing rapid evolution. the k+a fraction is, however, slightly weaker than expected, in the low density environments of massive clusters and close to luminous neighbors. this deviation may indicate that a small fraction of starbursts are triggered by interactions with the intracluster medium, although the triggering mechanism appears to be much more likely for massive clusters. if triggering occurs, the galaxy star - formation rate will decline very rapidly, and we will see a population of blue galaxies at the virial radius.'''

the two major x - ray observatories, chandra and xmm - newton, are successfully operating at a few redshifts in the large scale structure of the universe. due to their high angular resolution, neither of the two missions can be used to study objects at high redshift, as it would be done with a telescope. here we will propose a new mission, xeus, that will be capable of detecting point sources out to a distance of @xmath0, and carrying out in - depth studies of the objects in that region. xeus will be able to measure the line emission from the intra - cluster medium, and characterize the composition and temperature of the hot intergalactic medium. this will allow us to study the formation and evolution of the dominant species of baryonic matter ( stars and galaxies ) present in the universe, and to detect the x - rays emitted by these objects up to redshift of 10. by tracing the out - of - cluster gas in groups and clusters of galaxies as well as the gas in filaments, we expect to determine the epoch, when these massive objects first emerged, and the mechanisms by which they formed. also, by tracing these objects in a deep map of the cosmic microwave background, we can get information on the physical conditions in the early universe. many of the basic cosmological issues need to be resolved from the observational point of view, and these include : * what was the physics of dark matter? * how did the large - scale structure form? * what types of galaxies formed? * where did the black holes and agn arise from the initial star formation rate and the rate at which black holes at the centers of galaxies accrete matter. * how heavy elements formed? it is not clear if the universe formed any heavy elements prior to the epoch of black hole formation, and whether the abundances of these elements remained constant along the way.
we consider the interplay of genotype - phenotype maps and stochastic dynamics in speciation. we show that, in the case of dna - like sequences, these two can be each other s degrees of freedom, leading to incompatibilities if two hybrids diverge, but acting in a synergistic manner. in fact, we find that the intergenerational change in phenotype can drive the evolution of the first hybrid towards a phenotype that is more similar to that of the other, while the genetic difference between the two is amplified by a factor of 2 or more. these results are obtained analytically and confirm the basic properties of the full set of equations describing the evolutionary fitness landscape, from which we derive estimates of the dna binding energies. we also show that the change in fitness landscape is not necessarily independent of the length of the evolutionary change, and we predict that, for small populations, it becomes anti - correlated with the population size. speciation is the act of a genetic mutation that takes place inside a population @xcite. in a seemingly unrelated field, speciation plays an important role in explaining the origin of the diversity of human characteristics @xcitethat is seen across a wide range of biological contexts, from from pathogens ( e.g. the brain ) to the cell cytoskeleton or the golgi apparatus@xcite, where a particular set of genotypes with a distinct set of mutations is found necessary to describe the behaviour of a wide variety of cells. this diversity is perpetuated by genetic mutations, which in turn out to be responsible for the majority of the mutations in the genome, as well as by alleles mutations and self - mutations. speciations are driven by a balance between a tendency of phenotypes to increase their fitness and to adapt to changes in phenotype space, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ` ` adaptation to phenotype space '. for example, if we assume that two genotypes share the same set of genes, then we can assume that the first is almost exclusively genetic variants of the same phenotype, the second is somewhat more likely to have a small contribution from alleles, but otherwise the genetic differences can not be predicted. this is due to the highly correlated nature of the genetic information in genotype space. in the long - term evolution of a population, however, this balance between genotypes can be very different, and can lead to very different phenotypes diverging even when the two hybrid genomes are nearly indistinguishable. our aim in this paper is to show that this is indeed
the concept of optical ghost imaging was introduced by einstein - podolsky - rosen in the language of nonlocal correlations of two independent photons. it is general in nature and applies to any radiation, including thermal light. the concept of two - photon interference " was extended by hanbury brown and twiss in 1956. despite the successful application of this concept to thermal light, there are still many open questions concerning its classical nature. in this paper, we will discuss the three main questions : is the ghost imaging phenomenon due to constructive - destructive interference between chaotic sub - fields, is it a quantum interference or a classical intensity fluctuation correlation? we will then analyze the physical mechanisms underlying type - one and type - two ghost imaging in terms of the biphoton amplitudes of an entangled photon - pair using the equations of motion of a nonlinear crystal pumped by a continuous wave ( cw ) and the dynamics of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ). the imaging lens is a focal length- and background - dependent lens which illuminates the light passing through the aperture. we envision the lensless ghost imaging setup as a lens that consists of a pair of independent nonlinear crystals of different thickness. the point - to - point correlation between the object and the image planes is considered as the result of a statistical correlation of intensity fluctuations. this is contrary to classical optics where markovian correlations dominate. however, despite the similarity in the nature of thermal light and the proposed theory of ghost imaging, the opposite may happen : it might be true that chaotic radiations propagate to any transverse plane in a random and chaotic manner. this then allows for a simple explanation of the experiment of pittman _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 95 *, 194102 ( 1995 ) ] : any radiation starting from a point on the object plane will collapse " to a unique pointon the image plane. similar to that of type - 1, it involves the nonlocal superposition of two- photon amplitudes. contrary to the case of physical optics, the ghost image is a reproduction, either magnified or demagnified, of the illuminated object. furthermore, unlike classical light, objects will experience unequal distance propagations to superpose destructively at all other points on the image surface. we will conclude that the concepts of quantum and classical ghost imaging are not equivalent and should not be considered to apply to each other.
we demonstrate experimentally the generation of a double - charge optical vortex with two different degrees of spatial coherence in a collimated white - light laser beam. instead of using a holographic phase mask to imprinting the vortex phase, we employ a technique where an optical vortex of double charge is generated directly in the presence of a spatially incoherent polychromatic light beam. this technique avoids the use of a phase mask and can be used to study the long - distance propagation of strongly incoherent light beams. we show that the vortex visibility remains characterised by a visibility length which is determined by the distance at which the vortex core completely disappears during its propagation. subsequently, after some propagation, the vortex image is washed out completely by the beam focusing, but may reappear in the later stages of propagation due to the large spatial incoherence of the beam. additionally, we study the focusing of the vortex beam by a lens and find that even in the case of very weak coherence, a vortex imprinted into a highly incoherent beam can be associated with the source transverse size so that the information about the vortex can be effectively transfered from the cross - correlation function to its intensity distribution. 10 m. volyar, ` ` physics of phase singularities, '' rev. mod. phys. * 81 *, 10411093 ( 2008 ). p. trevino, l. d. campbell, d. richardson, w. e. coppage, and d. r. smith, ` _ optical vortex generation from single - charge halos and single - photon transients _ _ in laser beams _ _ phys. rev. lett. * 85 *, 421001 ( 2009 ). m. fleischhauer, a. j. verhoef, m. daniell, r. m. andreacute, s. p. paar, and j. i. zheludev _ ` ` phase singularity generation in monochromatic and incoherent laser beams '' _ j. opt. soc. am. b * 22 *, 484488 ( 2007 ). d. hayashi, t. takahashi, k. kobayashi, i. prez - hernndez, and s. a. walmsley _ _ optics _ ( wiley - interscience, new york, 2000 ). i. v. vrakking, p. t. skubic, and y. s
in this paper, we investigate a voting model that involves collective herding behaviours. in which individuals exhibit a behaviour between that of digital and analog herders, i.e., @xmath0-type herers. in this behaviour, most individuals observe the actions of other individuals to estimate public perception and then make a choice based on it. since public perception is usually sensible, it is important to be able to make a rational decision based on rational decision. however, it can lead to arbitrary or even erroneous decisions. this behaviour is often related to the complexity of the problem that is difficult to identify or quantify : first, due to the large size of the state, the voting annealing schedule has to be adequately slow, and second, the behavior of individuals may be affected by social influence. in previous papers, we showed that by using mean field approximations, one can relate the behaviour of the voting model to an information cascade transition, that is, a transition from one - peak to two - peaks of previous votes could be observed when the number of votes becomes finite. using numerical simulations and analysis, we show that for finite voting total, no phase transition occurs and that the solution oscillates between two equilibria. furthermore, we discuss relations among our voting model, kirman s ant colony model, and kinetic ising model. * information cascade and phase transition in voting models * + gabriela guevara - carrion, jinn - ouk gong, and hans hasse@xmath1__dipartimento di fisica, universit dellinsenbereich, paul sabio vera, + peter l. bianchi 46, i-0013350 bari, italy. + e - mail : kvetic@bu.edu.il + * keywords : * information cascades, information cascade, phase transition, random choice, voting model
we present measurements of the collective excitations of wigner island particles in the limit of low temperature. we have used a lindemann criterion to define the ` ` melting '' temperature, which depends on the local order and is represented, for instance, in the case of colloidal systems by a constant value for all configurations. the results clearly show that configuration transitions play an important role in the disordering, at least for intermediate temperatures. we discuss the possible origin of this disorder and how to correct for it. order - disorder transitions are of great interest in many areas of physics, e.g. in condensed matter physics, where they allow one to design very simple devices, be they they optically thin or -thin films on a substrate. in many solid - state systems, much effort has been put into understanding how a given system can form from a series of smaller ones. on the other hand, a wider perspective is also taken into account in many seemingly unrelated examples : when a molecule is formed by nucleation of short pieces of bristles, the length of the molecule is strictly measured as a function of its diameter @xcite. in the same spirit, the very long lifetimes of very small molecules are expected to be much shorter than the timescale of its chemical and physical evolution @xcit ; this is why they are called ` ` single - molecule '' systems. despite their relatively short life times, single particles still manage to exhibit spatial and temporal order in the form of structures or devices. a particularly interesting example of such spatial ordering is the so - called intrashell ordering " : for a given local configuration, the inter - shell angular displacement is smaller than in its original form. this is due to the fact that the constituent particles are not restricted to the two consecutive shells but instead are allowed to move around in a circular frame. this leads to a spatial order which is ultimately determined by the local geometry of the system. in this context, the motion of the particles is also of importance : if the system is represented by a two - dimensional sphere, then the interplay of spatial order and local order can easily lead to the loss of the orientational order and to the formation of a radial fluctuation. the purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of configuration transitions on the localization of particles in small systems and to describe how this disorder can be accounted for through correlation functions.
we present the first high resolution imaging of a sub sample of the compact high velocity clouds ( chvcs ), previously observed by braun & burton. the data obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) at the european southern observatory, are sensitive enough to make precise measurements of the spatial and kinematic properties of these objects, while also providing the first reliable distance estimate. the imaging reveals a population of compact hvcs with an elliptical shape, a velocity gradient aligned with the major axis, and a characteristic morphology other than that of a core / halo. these properties are strongly consistent with self - gravitating systems at local group distances, while the small angular size of the cores and the even smaller surface covering factor of the high column density cores make these objects ideal to study in absorption. for one object, chvc069 + 04@xmath0, we measure the metallicity of the hvc to be @xmath1 solar, while more typical hvc populations would have to reach out to the halo and beyond for this quantity to be accurately estimated. in another system, the chvc2300 + 075, we detect an extended hvc halo clump at a projected distance of about 0.7 mpc from the galaxy center. in this case we also find the typical morphology of a hvc ensemble consisting of some 10 compact cores spread over a 30 arcmin diameter region. the line of sight to these systems is split into two rather distinct components, with the first component concentrating at the local group distance and the second at the extragalactic distance. in all cases the total flux due to the cnm in these compact cores is larger than 40 %, substantially more than the 40 % cnm fraction in braun and burton s chvc sample. a characteristic rotation curve can be fitted simultaneously by rotation in flattened disk systems, and can be used to interpret the linewidths and shapes of the rotation curves in two of these systems. the presence in the foreground of a hot cnm flow, and the presence of cold, dense material within compact cores, are indicative of a dark matter fraction higher than unity.
recent theoretical advances in the study of edge states associated with a topological quantum state have led to a proposal for a floquet topological insulator ( fti ) in semiconductor quantum wells. we propose a simple non - equilibrium perturbation which can turn the topological properties of the system on and off, and leads to the formation of robust edge states in a finite system. we discuss various methods to experimentally realize such a quantum gap in the quasi - energy spectrum using experimentally accessible electromagnetic radiation in the microwave - thz regime. an experimental route to the fti is electric field realization. it is found that a periodic electric field is perhaps the most promising alternative to the in - plane field which, in the absence of a time - dependent zeeman field, leads to robust co - propagating edge modes. our results imply that thin hgte / cdte quantum wells can be robustly supported by non - uniform periodic electric fields such as those proposed for a fuv - capacitor related to the z - scheme. topological materials consist of a variety of exotic states which are topologically protected against scattering at will @xcite. a particularly interesting class of topological states is the floquet phase, in which the electronic wave - function is protected by a nontrivial topological topology. in this theory, non - trivial topological phases are characterized by an exponential dispersion in the multi - particle schrdinger equation, and by topological chiral edge states, which arise upon cooling the quantum well down to a temperature below which they are gapped by the zeeman energy. these states are known to exist in bulk semiconductors, and they have been experimentally realized in a number of different types of materials such as ttfcus@xmath0c, tcht - hgse@xcite, and zb(tc)-lattice polydiss. auf dem hgel 69, 170408, istituto sistemi complessi, spaziale e fisica, + universidade federal do rio grande do norte, 59072 - 970, natal, rn, brazil. _ related writing ( _ e.g. _, paper i.a. _, in this proceedings ). the paper has been authored under contract no. de - ac02 - 06ch11357, december 2002. the author is grateful to prof. dr. stephen hawking for his assistance and guidance during the development of
we investigate the relationship between metallicity ( @xmath0 ) and a variety of physical properties of local galaxies using a bayesian technique applied to three samples of type 0 and 1 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss - dr7 ). in each sample, we derive line - of - sight stellar masses, star formation rates ( sfr ), specific sfr ( ssfr ) and black hole masses, and examine the dependence of @xma0 on these parameters. our main results are : ( 1 ) the gas - phase metallicities ( i.e., the ratios of the sdss fibre - magnitude to that given by the sdse model magnitude ) are strongly dependent on sfr, with a 1@xmath3 dispersion of only 0.15 dex in stellar mass. ( 2 ) at fixed - sfr the relationship shifts further towards lower metallicities, towards a higher zero, and towards a correlation between stellar mass and the sfr. ( 3 ) a weak dependence on ssfr is also found, although within the range of masses studied, this dependence is difficult to explain. ( 4 ) the turnover in the metal - poor - to - metallicities relation is found to be coincident with a decrease in sfr at low stellar mass, but is _ not _ accompanied by a significant increase in metallicitiy at the high - mass end. ( 5 ) we also produce a simulation of the evolution of the fundamental metallius relation ( fmr ) which reproduces the main features of the observational data. this provides a qualitative agreement between the models and the observations, whilst highlighting the limitations of the latter. we suggest that the low - ssfr galaxies in our sample have undergone _ gradual dilution _ of their gas phase over time, rather than a continuous shut down of star formation. prompted by these results, we discuss the possibility that galactic outflows are responsible for the low metallicities observed in the low mass end of the fmr.

the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) has obtained deep ( @xmath0 750-pc ) spectra from a slit in the halo of the edge - on small spiral galaxy ngc 891 with the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope. emission lines from the gas in the three main - axis slit along the major axis on the ne side of the slit were detected at three epochs, corresponding to transitions from doubly- to singly - ionized, or high- and low - temperature states of ionization. the two brightest lines show no significant variation along the slit. at the position of the three brightest emission filaments, the ratios of [ s@xmath2ii]/h://xmath3 k to [ n_2ii ] and [ s_n_ii ]/h@xday1 show a pronounced rise from 3 kpc sw to 1 kpc, with an upper limit of 0.05. comparison of these line ratios with ionization models shows that some of the ionizing photons may travel down the slit and ionize the gas, leaving the way for the reynolds et al. ( 1993 ) to explain the dig observations. the unexpected rise in the ratios suggests that the ionization of the gas may be less than 100 %. a thermal balance between ionization and thermodynamic equilibrium is found to be responsible for the majority of the dig emission, with the balance between thermal equilibrium and photo - ionization occurring in the highly ionized layers of moderate mass stars in the disk of the galaxy. this balance occurs at temperatures of about 50 - 100k. other possible sources of heating for the dig are considered, including microflares from magnetic reconnection and shocks. the results from these investigations indicate that a significant fraction of the input energy goes into the dig from sources other than the stellar radiation field. it is difficult to determine the feasibility of a pure thermal balance model, as there is considerable latitude in the physical parameters in the case of tmls. in addition, the data can not be fit without including a second source of energy input, which is likely to be shocks. surveys in the near future are expected to reveal more of this process.
the statistics of the energy exchange between two subvolumes of a quantum system is governed by the uncertainty relation. we apply this principle to the measurements of the fluctuations in the number of photons emitted by a mesoscopic conductor into a linear medium. we calculate the statistics of energy flow into the linear medium and their fluctuations into the right reservoir. we illustrate our method with a particularly simple example where the flow of energy dissipated in the right circuit is measured over a long time. in the absence of an external voltage gradient the distribution of dissipated heat is nonsingular and can be described by a fourth - order sigma model. we also discuss how a measurement of the frequency and amplitude of electrical current fluctuations can be a useful tool for measuring higher order correlators of electrical currents whose measurement poses a challenge. the exchange of energy between quantum systems is subject to an uncertainty relation that is neither exact nor approximate. this relation has been established perturbatively in a weak coupling of the photo - detector to the electromagnetic field @xcite and is believed to be the origin of the above - mentioned uncertainty@xcite. in contrast to charge transfer, there is a classical probabilistic interpretation for the energy transfer since it does not involve an exact correlation between the energy flux into the part of the quantum system with respect to which the energy is exchanged. for example, a system that is transferred by a charge - based coulomb interaction to a magneto - superconducting device is said to be " transfer - free _ if _ it can be measured locally in the frequency domain where the resistance to dissipation is smaller than the applied voltage. in this context, energy transfer is also considered to be energy - efficient because it works in the same way as charge transfer. one of the main goals of modern physics is to understand the way in which the microscopic quantum mechanical interaction affects the macroscopic behavior of large systems. for this purpose, several experimental techniques have been developed to investigate the microscopic correlations of mesoscopic conductors and photons. these techniques can be roughly classified into two groups : those that aim to measure the microscopic energy fluctuations in order to extract information about the microscopic state of the system and the ultimate goal of understanding physical phenomena that we will call _ fundamental ground - state physics_. in this letter we discuss a new approach to quantum charge statistics that is based on the concept of being coupled to an external source through a local field. we assume that the source has a power - law i.e. voltage biased and is connected to the conductors via a local
we study the cosmological evolution of a new dark energy model, dubbed _ quintom _, which consists of two scalar fields, one being the quintessence field and the other being the phantom field. this has been proposed as a possible means to unify the early inflation and current acceleration of the universe, leading to oscillations of the hubble constant and a recurring universe. we study the current observational constraints on the model of oscillating quintom. specifically we consider a variation of the model with an equation of state given by @xmath0 and use the same fitting method we use to normalize the model in the linear parameterization. we find that the period of oscillation is not much fixed in our simple two parameter expansion, which allows us to explore large parameter spaces for the oscillating model. when considering the high redshift observational data such as sn ia and cmb the difference is significant. we also find the linear growth factor of the quintom model is somewhat smaller than that of the linearly parameterized dark energy case. though the result of our analysis is not final, our result will be useful as an example to understand how the faint end of the spectrum of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology is affected by the accumulation of observational data. * key words : * cosmology : theory;cosmology: observations; quintom ; flat universe ; oscillating dark energy * the experimental constraints on dynamical dark energy models * * in quintom : * * quintom * * contents * * introduction*@xcite. * * background *. * dark energy is evolving rapidly. the observed universe is spatially flat and accelerating. there are strong evidences that the universe is still expanding at the present time. the large scale structure(lss ) data is consistent with the idea that the acceleration is driven by the domination of a small scalar field, dubbed dark energy. the best fit parameter for the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) fitting would be the cmb shift parameter @xcite, but it suffers from the fine tuning and coincidence problem. as an illustrative effect we use the literature leading to similar conclusion. *
we present the results of simultaneous, multi - wavelength observations of two ultracool dwarfs,, and, which exhibit high - level magnetic activity in the radio, h@xmath0, and x - rays. we find that, as in earlier observations of, the radio behavior is dominated by coherent emission from a large - scale and uniform magnetic field with a strength of @xmath1 kg and resolve the rotation period of the central star. quiescent emission is detected in both objects, which suggests that magnetic activity is generated in the chromospheres of late m dwarfs by at least one of the following mechanisms : ( i ) the release of magnetic energy through processes such as reconnection leads to acceleration of electrons, and subsequent heating of the chromosphere, transition region, and corona through evaporation ; ( ii ) a second - order phase transition occurs at a temperature of about 30 k, as inferred from the radio - to - x - ray ratios ; and ( iii ) chromospheric heating by continuous micro - flaring activity. in the case of, we detect persistent radio emission in all of our individual exposures, and observe a pattern of behavior different from that of the m8.5 transient rotator, which demonstrates a transition to a period of nearly 4 full rotations. we attribute this behavior to the different generation and dissipation of magnetic fields in the two objects. the radio observations are consistent with a long - term, linear correlation between the level of activity and stellar rotation, which is consistent with previous observations, and points to a change in the properties of the magnetic field and its dissipation on timescales of several years in the late m dwarf regime. our simultaneous observations of and reveal several pieces of evidence for the existence of collective activity in m0m6 dwarfs. in addition to the radio data, we find evidence for correlated variations in the highly variable and low - ionization uv emission, as well as highly variable radio flux. we present a detailed analysis of the behavior of and, to which we attribute these observations and discuss the implications for the dynamo s dynamo model.

we explore the physical properties of a sample of @xmath0 early - type galaxies selected from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images of the goods / cdfs field. this is a pre - selected sample, which extends to high redshift without any evidence for a significant stellar population enhancement, i.e. without the presence of major star formation or a significant population of blue galaxies. by analyzing the resolved color distribution of this sample, we find a trend in the sense that the red galaxies are redder than the blue galaxies with a similar amount of recent or ongoing star formation. this trend is compatible with a pure metallicity radial gradient in the colour - magnitude diagram and rules out a significant spread in stellar ages within the galaxies. no significant upturn in the stellar ages are found. as a result, we classify the galaxies into three sub - classes : _ blue _ galaxies, _ red _ galaxies with star formation _ started _ in the early phase of their evolution and classified as early - types in the recent past. about half of these galaxies have a red core in their optical color - magnitude relations, suggesting that most of the stellar populations in these galaxies were formed _ before _ the onset of the red sequence. the other half have red cores that are present at the present epoch and are classified as late - type ellipticals. the fact that a significant fraction of the galaxies in this sub - category show emission lines suggests that they are undergoing a second star forming episode. we further explore the _ internal color distribution _ for this sample and find that it follows the kormendy relation of local elliptical galaxies. a companion paper by thomas et al.

we show how an ultrafast single - mode detector based on an on - chip single - clamped cantilever can be used to observe the spin dynamics of a spinor boson bec of a few thousand rb atoms in a tight optical confinement due to the interaction of light with the atomic spins. the instrument used is a novel waveguide which allows to adjust the couplings between the spin states of the bec with only a negligible back action on the condensate. this allows us to produce pure spinor bec models with a wide range of coherence properties. moreover, using the technique set up here, we show that the recently developed technique of faraday rotation is also utilized to obtain the state of a single atomic spin in the presence of an external magnetic field. we discuss the feasibility of observing the bec spin dynamics by means of ultrafast measurements on a ` ` spinor '' bec, by comparing the efficiency with that due to be induced by a magnetic tip applied to a micro- and nano - mechanical system. finally, we discuss how the new results can be applied to detect the decay of quantum coherence in complex quantum systems. following our previous studies on feshbach resonances in atomic systems @xcite, the field of ultrabroadband imaging has recently attracted much attention as a new field of investigation. owing to the recent availability of very high - speed pulses of light, it has been shown that the use of high - luminosity lasers opens up a new branch of applications in sensing and controlling matter. in particular, the detection of the spin and angular momentum of light has proven to be a very useful tool for the study of quantum dynamical systems, where one can obtain information about the internal and external degrees of freedom of a many - body system. in this line of research, as well as the promise of economically and operationally useful analytical methods, a good deal of progress has been made for the control and manipulation of spin systems, so far only indirectly through the measurement of the ground state of other spin systems@xcite. for example, by using the momentum measurement on a few body spins, an atomic force microscopy ( fov ) setup has been setup to measure the angular momentum distribution of a collection of mechanical excitations, i.e., the larmor frequency, of an array of identical spins. such measurements have been performed on a variety of different systems, ranging from bulk two - dimensional electron gases ( bose - einstein condensates, dirac fermions, superfluid
we examine the excitation and infrared radiative transfer of water vapor in the surface layers of protoplanetary disks, focusing on the large amounts of warm water that have been observed in the mid - infrared _ spitzer _ space telescope infrared spectrometer ( irs ) wavelength range ( 10 - 36 @xmath0o ). to date, neither the observational work nor theoretical models have considered the chemistry specifically the actual abundance structure of the molecule in order to be able to explain the observed line ratios and line strengths in a meaningful way. we propose that, given the complexity of inner disk chemistry and volatile dynamics, observations of high excitation water lines can best be explained by models with either _ in situ _ formation or _ dynamical transport _ from larger radii. to solve this problem, we propose a number of steps. first, we investigate how the line emission from water vapor levels in the ground level spectrum depends on the properties of the disk. non - lte, single column density, single excitation temperature models do not provide a good fit to data in the observed range of radii, and thus lead to erroneous conclusions when attempting to compare abundances with chemical models. we introduce a steep gas temperature increase at high altitudes in the disk to account for the increased line emission. second, we show that the gas - to - dust ratio must be increased by one to two orders of magnitude with respect to the canonical value, as derived from the ism ism ratio, in order for lines to be formed at higher densities. we also show that grain growth and dust settling can significantly contribute to the line strengths. third, we speculate that additional depletion of water along the vertical axis is responsible for the increase in line - to continuum ratios. we present a model in which water is transported from the surface by the radial cold finger effect, and where it migrates from the cold surface water vapor, transported in a vertical location where the effect of snowballs is at work. this vertical cold migration can provide a viable explanation for the higher line emission compared to the on - going cold emission from the transiting water column density material. we apply these results to the case of dr tau and as 205a and suggest that this may be the mechanism or process for the accumulation of water on the icy bodies that form and oxygen enrichment of the solar nebula.
we discuss the performance of the independent component analysis ( ica ) as applied to the polarized sky observed in the microwave band. the ica is based on the assumption that the background and foreground signals are independent, requiring no other prior on the signals to recover, on their pattern or frequency scaling. all the available data and simulations on the galactic foreground emission indicate that the cmb and galactic emission are highly statistical independent, while the galaxy is known to be highly non - gaussian. this work represents an exploratory study, not specialized to describe any particular operating or planned experiment, nor to quantify what is the minimum level of @xmath0 modes detectable in presence of foregrounds. our aim is rather to determine if the _ blind _ component separation techniques have the capability to recover the @xcot modes of the cmp, which are on the level as predicted in the current best fit cosmological models and are observed on a limited patch of the sky, in the presence of a substantial foreground contamination as estimated on the basis of the current models of the galactic emission. more specifically, we evaluate the stability of the results against variations in the sky area covered and the abundance of primordial gravitational waves. we demonstrate that the claim that the error induced by the reconstruction is of the order of the cosmic plus noise sample variance, remains true in all these cases. moreover, the outputs exhibit a remarkable stability for a large foreground fluctuation amplitude, several times larger than predicted by the current foreground models ; this may be due to a compensation between the degradation which would be caused by the large foreground signal and the fact that the latter can be extracted as it gets larger over the noise and temperature of the foreground emission. we are able to verify that, after ica has removed suboptimal contamination at the level of the bimodal, or larger, point sources, it is adequate for the verification of the polarized signal as a function of frequency and sky area.

we present the first measurement of the radial velocity of the stellar component of the phoenix dwarf spheroidal galaxy, using the fors1 instrument at the vlt - antu telescope. we have obtained spectroscopy of 31 red giant branch stars in the field of phoenix, obtained at the very large telescope, for which we also obtain spectra of a subset of 26 red horizontal branch stars. from the velocity centroid of the hi cloud in phoenix we derive an heliocentric distance of @xmath0 kpc, which corresponds to a distance from the galaxy of about 120 kpc ( assuming an einsteinian distance modulus of 25 kpc ). the distance to the galaxy is consistent with a recent milky way origin, while the actual velocity is closer to the galactic center. the model that we propose is that the hi was once associated with phoenix and participated in the last star formation episode of the galaxy about 100 myr ago, which is the age of the youngest horizontal branch star ( heb ) in the galaxy. this association might explain the mass, distance, velocity and total amount of hi mass inferred for phoenix. however, since phoenix is at a distance of about 1.5 kpc from the galacticcenter, this association is not likely. we discuss a series of semi - analytical and numerical simulations, under the assumption that ( i ) the gas has been stripped along the trajectory, and ( ii ) the ram - pressure stripping is responsible for the gas stripping, leading to boundary conditions ( very large number of supernovae required or large density of the intergalactic medium, igm ), which make us conclude that this one is a chance superposition. we derive that the kinetic energy necessary to eject the gas is due to the igm, and that the amount of gas transferred in this way is sufficient to blow away the remaining hi cloud. this scenario therefore appears to be the most viable explanation for the observed association of the gas cloud with the galaxy, since it is the most plausible one for the entire phoenix disk, up to the most recent star formation event that took place about 100myr ago. two scenarios for the loss of this gas are discussed : its ejection by the released energy released by the sne produced in that last event of star formation, and ram pressure stripping. # 1#2#3#4#1#2
we study the asymptotics of a markov - modulated infinite - server queue modulated by a finite - state irreducible background process. when the background process is in state @xmath0, jobs arrive according to a poisson distribution with a termination rate which is a linear combination of a random variable ( the so - called background process ) and a polynomial function of the arrival time. in the absence of explicit data, the results obtained are implicit, in that they are in terms of partial differential equations characterizing the probability generating functions related to the transient behavior of the system. also, the manner in which the tail of the distribution of the poisson parameters is evaluated is not directly observable. the method used to obtain the results is a combination of two explicit results ( the first being a simple variant of a classical result due to bahadur and rao @xcite ) and implicit results based on a system of ( partial ) differential equations. the obtained results are used to improve previous results in the literature on the _ average _ as well as _ limit _ theorems. as for instance, it has been shown recently that logarithmic or large - deviation behaviors can be induced in networks with a finite number of servers if the inverse distance between the sender and the receiver ( i.e., the size of the queue ) is enormously large ; in this case, the frequent termination of a job is not increasingly rare, but, instead, the probability of it being present at the time of the job s sojourn is generally as small as its probability of being rare. recent research efforts have focused on the exploration of various limits for this model, ranging from the small - deviation regime ( where jobs are rare but not so frequently that they do not leave the system quickly enough to be observed by the client in the early stages of the simulation of the network evolution ( which is commonly referred to as the burstiness regime ) to the large - deviations regime ( in which jobs are frequently so rare that they should not be observed in the system at all ). in this paper we focus on the latter case, but the results presented are applicable to a broader context than for the single - server case.
shock waves collision in four dimensional gravity are a key ingredient to understand the physics of black hole mergers and the non - abelian structure of space - time. we consider the collision of two shoockwaves of identical massless waves ( with lorentz signature ) that result from boosting one black hole to the speed of light along a given direction. the collision is not axisymmetric and involves a non zero impact parameter. our goal is to determine the evolution of this impact parameter assuming that we know it in some time interval ( negative times ). we take into account the interaction of the one particle with the gravitational field created from the second particle and vice versa. in terms of feynman diagrams, loosely speaking, these corrections correspond to two vertex diagrams that look like those we have developed in ( ordinary ) gravity in ( four dimensional ) four dimensions. the main work of this paper is to show how these diagrams may be calculated to order @xmath0. in particular, we especially apply this technique to a metric that is almost flat but contains two shock waves moving opposite to each other and colliding. the shock waves provide an effective stress - energy tensor in addition to the ( actual ) tensor that creates the two shockwaves. we specify the boundary conditions of the field equations and the corresponding green s function. we show how the integrations on the light - cone and transverse plane may be performed omitting some of the intermediate steps for appendices [ a ], [ b ] and [ c ]. eventually we derive a formula for the metric tensor, equation ( [ gmn2 ] ), to the order we are working with. we argue that the presence of matter and the back - reaction effects should not be ignored as they may lead to an inappropriate transformation of the metric into one that is more conformal field theory like. the model that we use is not spherical although it is conformally neutral. we also show that the metric is traceless up to specific times only if the shock - wave impact parameter is zero. _ keywords : _ shock waves collision, non linear gravitational dynamics, adiabatic mass transfer, gauge theories at strong coupling
we investigate the kinematics and physical properties of the ionized gas and stellar populations of ten galaxies selected in the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ), using integral field unit ( ifu ) @xmath0-band and sinfoni 3-d spectroscopy. the objects of this sample have spectroscopic redshifts, derived from vlt / vimos ` deep'field photometry, and they have high velocity dispersions with respect to the local interstellar medium ( igm ). we find relations between the luminosities and ages of the stellar populations, as well as, star formation rates ( sfrs ) and the gas mass fractions. we also find a strong correlation between the ratio of the total dynamical mass ( gas+stars ) to the luminous stellar mass ( stars+gas ) at a given redshift. this correlation is much tighter than the tully - fisher relation, suggesting that the disks of these galaxies are supported by a large and massive cold gas disk similar to that of the local spiral galaxies. our kinematical and physical results are consistent with the hypothesis that the observed high - redshift disk galaxies are undergoing a burst of star formation. we present evidence of two types of rotation : ` ` hot '' and ` ` perturbed '' rotators. the rotation disks of the ` heated'disk galaxies would be puffed up by recent star formation, while the ` cold'disks would be cold rotators which are likely to result from the effects of recent mergers. we propose to refine our classification : disk galaxies of the first family would be called ` hot / perturbed rotators ', while disk galaxies from the second family would meet the definition of ` cold rotator '. only hot rotators and objects dominate by random motions, like the merger, suggest that the present - day local spirals possess a large disk of gas and younger stellar populations ( age < 1 gyr ), which can further grow in mass by continued accretion. we discuss the implications of these results for the formation and evolution of ` thick'disks and disk galaxies at high-@xmath1. these disks could be an important ingredient in the formation of massive disk galaxies and in the drive of galaxy - disk interactions.
recent work has shown that the spectral correlation function ( scf ) can be used to discriminate among numerical simulations of various turbulent regimes, isothermal with large- and small - scale forcing, and ism - like. in this work we extend the work of rgww by applying the scf to higher - dimensional simulations of interstellar turbulence. we construct scf maps in four ` ` modes '', with and without thermal broadening of lines, and compare their properties to those of simulated interstellar medium ( ism ) spectroscopic data. the comparison of the simulated data cubes with the observed data allows workers to estimate the accuracy of the simulations, and to point out physical ingredients ( density and velocity ) that are needed to match the observations. we find that, for runs including stellar energy injection, self - gravity and magnetic field, the scfs produced by the most ` ` hot '' ( @xmath0 k ) isothermal simulations tend to be much narrower and to have higher mean values than their non - thermally broadened counterparts. this is a reflection of the fact that in the non - isothermal runs, almost all of the velocity structure is accessible through self - absorption features in the line profiles, while in the ism, most velocity structures are very prominent. for runs involving gas with relatively small velocity jumps ( corresponding to the warm phases of the interstellar medium ), we find the largest scf structures in the simulations are confined to regions of very small and large scale velocity dispersion. we conclude that for the largely subsonic ism in simulations with large - scale velocity jumps, ` ` worms '' may be associated to caustics in the position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data cube, which are formed when the local density reaches a threshold value greater than 10 times the mean density, producing local bubbles of warm gas that expand and feed the global turbulence. overall, our results imply that scf studies can be a powerful tool for researchers to understand the physics of anisotropic turbulence, and for testing models of this kind.
we present _ spitzer space telescope _ infrared spectra of debris disks around main sequence stars with spectral types b through m - type and ages between 1 myr and 1 gyr. the majority of the stars in our sample possess spectral features in the 5 - 40 @xmath0 m energy range. detailed modeling of circumstellar dust properties is limited by the temperature of the grains, which may be any combination of sub - micron grain size and grain temperature, and the presence of a perturbing black body. in 59 systems with spectral features, we find at least two distinctive dust populations. one population has a hot temperature ( 290 - 600 k ), inferred from detailed fits to crystalline silicate features, with a relative abundance of amorphous olivine and pyroxene, and another population cooler than 80 - 200 k with a residual continuum emission modeled by cool black body grains. in addition, we detect three belts of small bodies in some systems. two belts are associated with the jovian planets in our solar system and another with the kuiper belt in the asteroid system. the tight correlation between black body grain temperature and fractional infrared luminosity supports the idea that poynting - robertson drag may not be the dominant grain removal mechanism in debris disks. we find no clear correlation between dust grain distance and the age of the central star, in agreement with submillimeter studies. we suggest that stellar radiation pressure ( in collisionally dominated systems ), sublimation if the grains are icy, and/or collisional cascades between the remaining kilometer - sized planetesimals contribute to the dust grain separations in these disks. a dynamical influence of the binary companion star may play a similar role because its gravitational resonance energy tends to sweep through the main asteroid belt, sending debris disks into the inner solar system. we discuss the implications of a multi - body disk model for the formation and evolution of planetary cores via collisional equilibrium.
we present a theory of the resonant tunneling phenomena occurring in three - dimensional ( 3d ) ultra - sharp metallic structures. this is a result of the diagonalization of the time - independent schrdinger equation in @xmath0 ( fermi wavelength ) units and including the effects of mode coupling at waveguide junctions. the theory is based on observations of the coupling between different intermode modes at junction junctions of uniform section. we show the existence of ` ` resonance boxes '', where localized states can be contained inside periodic transverse box - like structures. by periodic repetition of the wire links we get a long chain of 3d resonance boxes, each of which comprises a localized state of different acimutal quantum numbers. we demonstrate that if we vary the geometrical parameters of these boxes over a certain number of junctions the system self - organizes into a coherent set of stable helical structures. in the limit of plane hard - wall confinement, these structures give rise to periodic density peaks in the conductance. we also point out the formation of a vortex structure, for the ballistic conductance, at a given limit of the ` ` ` step discontinuity '' in the wire topology. the striking feature of these structures is the appearance of periodic conducting charge and current density structures. we propose an analytical scheme to obtain the scattering matrix of a composite waveguide structure, which consists of the elements of a uniform section waveguide and a narrow - narrow - wide ( wnw ) junction. the diffusive and conductive components of such a structure have been studied in detail before. due to the ideal structure of these 3d wires we have access to a large set of theta functions, which are exactly corresponding to the transverse energy levels of the second transversal level in the narrow wire. it has been shown that the 2d and 3d problems can be solved in the same approximate way. ` ` as a by means of matrix methods ''. + pacs number(s ) : 72.20.mv, 42.50.lc, 02.70.+v, 03.65.+r, 74.60.-q, 74.75.-q 2d structures in metals and nanofilaments have been the focus of research of recent past has been the absorption of electrons in the form of optical cavities or _ cavities_. this has been possible for both periodic and non - periodic structures and in particular for monoatomic chains of various metals @xcite
recently, hoava had proposed a model for quantum gravity where the action for cosmological perturbations in hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity is power - counting renormalizable and hence potentially ultra - violet ( uv ). using this model, a detailed analysis of the perturbation theory shows that there is no additional dynamical scalar degree of freedom in the presence of matter at all, when perturations in hl gravity are found by consistently expanding around the frw metric and not around the flat minkoswki one. furthermore, in the limit @xmath0, the infrared ( ir ) limit of the action reduces to that of einstein gravity. in this work we investigate the ir limit of hoava theory from a general point of view. we find that, for a particular value of one of the parameters in the hl action, the theory has its ir fixed point the einstein action of gr. there are two apparent natural ways to express the extra degrees of freedom. one is to extend the sasaki - mukhanov variable to the infinitesimally general metric including scalar metric fluctuations. this avoids the necessity of expanding about minkowski space - time and therefore avoids the problem of losing gauge invariance. the other is to include the inflationary background in the analysis. making use of the recent analysis of @xcite, we exactly determine the corresponding functional form for the corresponding equations of motion, i.e., the corresponding to the curvature fluctuations, and find that the functional form almost cancels out in the uv region. our main result is that in the corresponding equation of motion for the scalar metrics fluctuations is the same as that in gr, namely that it does not modify the usual kinetic theory for general relativity. thus no extra dynamical extension of gr is required in this limit. a similar result holds for the case in which the spatially symmetric metric is the inflaton ( we focus on the so - called de sitter form of the metric ). we also compute the power spectrum ( or first order spectrum ) of cosmoparsec - scale fluctuations and discuss applications to inflationary cosmology. a specific derivation of the corresponding scale - invariant spectrum is also given.
the isothermal linear - response of the magnetotransport in a tetragonal heavy - fermion metal is investigated with sub - micron magnetic anisotropy in the presence of two parallel magnetic fields perpendicular to the magnetic hard axis. we observe a continuous crossover from one fermi surface to the other across the quantum critical point ( qcp ). the crossover is independent of sample quality and is well - defined and extends over a wide temperature range in the temperature - magnetic field phase diagram. the width of the critical crossover is not only independent of temperature but also proportional to it, suggesting that all the crossover crossover fwhm are consistent with the @xmath0@xmath1 scaling. this conclusion is supported by non - trivial linear - in - temperature behavior of the single - electron green s function, and is used to establish the connection between macroscopic critical fluctuations and the microscopic many - body excitations underlying the dynamical critical scaling. it is a common feature of quantum phase transitions that many - electron excitations are liquid in the quantum regime, with a single - particle width that depends not only on sample quality but also on temperature. this leads to the notion of a critical crossover, _ i.e. _, a discontinuity in the response to the external magnetic field. in systems that have a strong correlation between magnetic and electronic properties, such as high - temperature superconductors or topological insulators, the crossover of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is expected to play an important role in determining the phase transition probabilities @xcite. in conventional metals the qpts are characterized by a hall coefficient that reflects both the coherence of electronic and magnetic properties across the qcp. as a consequence, the hall coefficient and the magnetoresistivity of a metal are strongly correlated, and this gives rise to the possibility of tuning the material properties at low temperatures through the control parameter, _ e.g. _ the quasiparticle - paramagnetic transition from a semimetal to an antiferromagnetic ground state, and vice versa. a number of recent experiments have attempted to tune material properties through control measurements on magnetic quantum dots but have failed to convert the quantum - dot - like linear response into the classical behavior. in a series of publications, we have addressed this issue by using ultracold - temperature techniques to measure the linear response hall coefficient in a wide range of systems, sometimes called quantum critical materials, and we find that these systems are fundamentally different from their classical counterparts.
we explore the problem of online feature selection for binary classification tasks. our solution is based on the recent advances of second order online learning techniques, and exploits the second - order information of the classifier. compared to existing fs methods, the complexity is linear to the average number of nonzero features per instance, rather than the full feature dimensionality. in particular, unlike the existing first - order online fs approaches, the proposed algorithm exploits the weight vector of the linear classifier to select the most confident weights, while keeping the distribution close to the non - truncated distribution. it achieves highly competitive learning accuracy even compared with state - of - the - art batch fs methods. as a results, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on synthetic and real data on a large scale. we also evaluate the computational complexity of the above algorithms. our work is closely related to another online fs setting in which researchers attempt to follow online learning methodology by assuming training data arrives sequentially. despite its considerable advantages in efficiency and scalability over batch fs method, it remains slow when being applied to large - scale fs tasks with ultra - high dimensionalality. * keywords * : feature selection, online learning, sparse projection, strong learning, complex learning, large scale online learning * ams subject classifications * : 60k37, 60k35, 90m35. * etsuo sezione ` ` feature selection in data mining '' @xcite. @xmath0@acs.jhu.ac.uk/faculty/t henrikse@itshu.edu * received this mail : * alexis.shapiro@gmail.com * + jel codes : c90, c80, c90 + http://code.google.com/aaldog/ feature selection * abstract * is as follows.

in this article we characterize the german pig trade network as a substrate for disease spread. the system is considered as a time series of directed network snapshots at different time steps. in addition, causality is fully considered for network traversal via edge sequences. in each case the network comprises 97,980 nodes. as this network is a complex network, the effect of trade volume on the dynamics of disease spread is important. in this work we estimate the prevalence and the incidence rate of infectious diseases by analyzing the edge weights and using the temporal resolution of trade data. we will see that the directed nature of trade plays a major role here. in principle, the outbreak size of any epidemic on a network is limited by the problem that a disease can spread through this network. disease dynamics in networks has been intensively studied by veterinary epidemiologists to get a better understanding of the spatio - temporal livestock disease dynamics and to identify network actors that are central to the spread of infections. in general, there is no systematic characterization of this system in the literature so far. remarkable exceptions are where a subset of the whole network was analyzed including different production types and trade connections. this work provides a general framework to investigate livestock trade networks. * keywords * : disease spread ; germany ; network analysis ; time series ; structure ; structure
we examine the cooling of nanodiamonds in high vacuum, via optical cryocooling. we find that the achieved cooling is very sensitive to the overall quantum efficiency of the diamond held in the high vacuum trap. using the theory of so - called _ hot / cold brownian motion _, we predict that the thermal load due to blackbody absorption of ambient room temperature radiation by the cold particle can be reduced significantly. furthermore, we observe that the diffusion constant is altered by the cooling, in agreement with previous studies. using fuchtbauer - ladenburg theory we show that the effect of optically levitating defects in diamond may be optically visible in small diameter crystals. diamond is one of the most mystic solids known in nature @xcite. in recent years a series of successful and controversial experiments on nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) defects in atmospheres have sparked a widespread interest in the study of these rare materials and their behavior in extreme conditions @xcitethat is largely unknown outside the chemical research community. nv defects in air are typically small @xmath0 and consist of a few nv@xmath1 defects in a liquid solvent at room temperature. if these defects are heated to temperatures much higher than the equilibrium temperature of the liquid the energy is dissipated in a non - radiative way. over the past few years a number of defect solutions have been proposed to treat the nv defect problem @xcate. in most cases the solution is carbon nanotubes ( nanodtubes ) which are optically transparent in the near infrared ( 0.3 ev ). however a few of the proposed solutions lack the required depth to grow a nanodtube, and thus are difficult to test experimentally. in this study we examine the use of optical crycooling for the de - trapped nv diamond. since this defect does not give rise to a detectable thermal load in the liquid, it is very unlikely that the diamond s temperature can be lowered by cooling laser power. however the cooling power can be substantially reduced if one starts with a much lower temperature. this would allow one to increase the cooling rate by several orders of magnitude.
we present a large grid of simulated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for young stellar objects ( ysos ), constructed from axisymmetric yso models using a monte - carlo radiation transfer code. the models cover a wide range of viewing angles, stellar masses, accretion rates, disk and envelope parameters, as well as evolutionary stages. we present seds for a variety of color - color spaces, including the irac 7.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8@xmath0 m bands. we also present polarization spectra in the ubvri and jhkl bands for these models. we explore how the colors of a yso seds depend on its evolutionary stage, and also on the values of the various parameters used to fit the seds. for example, in the stage i ( ` ` embedded '' ) source, sources at early evolutionary stages show blue colors because the circumstellar dust is too hot to easily condense in these objects, but show red colors because of the high temperatures in the envelopes. in stage ii sources, the transition to the optically thin disk state can occur much earlier than in earlier stage i sources. in addition, the k - band polarization varies with disk mass and envelope accretion rate in a ways that are not directly related to the evolutionary stage. in particular, stage i source seds typically show a high polarization ( @xmath1 - 0.6 % ) at 1 - 8@xcite and a low polarization ( -0.5 - 1.2 % ) several weeks later, but produce red colors in the remaining stage ii and stage iii sources. these results indicate that for most sources the spectral index and color in the range of colors shared by the young stellar object ( yso ) seds are not closely correlated. also, the colors at a given viewing angle are not well - matched by the evolutionary age of the central sources in the sample. however, the dispersion in color between a given source and the yso is not strongly constrained by the sed, suggesting that the slope of the sed is not a good indicator of age.

we study d - branes at fixed points of an orbifold in 9 + 1 dimensional space - time described by world - volume theory of four d3-branes in type iib superstring theories. we assume that all the moduli, except for the vacuum expectation value of the ten - dimensional dilaton field, are stabilized. the six scalar fields in the brane moduli field background are identified with the embedding fields of the d@xmath0-brane at each fixed point, and as a result all supersymmetries are broken through the ` ` brane supersymmetry breaking '' mechanism. we present a new mechanism of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking by assuming that our 3 dimensional space consists of revolving d- branes around a fixed point. we study a simple model with revolving four and seven - brane at the fixed point described by the dbi action. three of them can be moved away from their current locations by a centrifugal force while the other two are held fixed at their current positions by the attractive force of an intervening attractive force. as an example, we consider a model in which the fourth and fifth branes are the same as the other three. the effect of the centrifugal potential is analytically studied. it is found that the d2 brane field locates at the same radius ( @xmath1 ) as the third brane and is stable there. the mass of the higgs boson corresponding to the fourth brane is one less than that of the first brane. we calculate the masses of various fields ( e.g., higgs doublet, nambu - goldstone, pb, and pb ) and find that the spectrum of these fields is a nonmonotonic five - fermion form of the massive scalar gauge boson. the spectrum turns out to be characterized by a pb - pb doublet with a mass of five ` ` super - yang - mills '' bosons and eight ` ` eight - massion '' goldstone bosons. these nine bosons come from the four - dimensional chan - paton gauge theory. we also introduce a new wilson line on anti - d7-bars on the third torus which is responsible for yukawa couplings in the standard model. it breaks the gauge symmetry in the present model. some properties of the symmetry breaking in the model are preserved, namely, the symmetry being spontaneously broken by the triplet brane, and
we present a complete set of millimeter - wave observations of the regions containing the embedded class ii methanol maser w3(oh ) and deeply embedded class iii h@xmath0o. these sources represent some of the most luminous regions of star formation having both high optical and uv luminosities. by modelling the optically - selected lines in the region, we find that the best - fitting non - lte model has the flux ratios of 1.1 @xmath1oh = 1.07 4.2 j = 0.944 and 1.25 @xfig1oh / j of 0.44 and 0.65 j = 2.2 and 2.07, respectively. even assuming that the pumping radiation is provided by dust and that the gas temperature is in the range 135 k, our model predicts an excitation temperature of about 220 k and an optical depth of about 3.7, compared to 200 k for the nearest class i maser sources. using a simplified model of the infrared radiation field, we show that none of the lines studied here are inverted or symmetric and range in effective temperatures from 1.9 to 44 ghz. furthermore, apart from the strongest lines, our maps do not show any evidence for systematic asymmetries or small scale structure. we summarize our findings by comparing them with similar studies of other star forming regions and conclude that there is no one - to - one correspondence between the regions in which the majority of of the maser emission originates. within 0.01 pc of each of these sources there is about one solar mass of warm gas, and on larger scales there are probably a few tens of solar masses of cooler, less dense gas. if the density of the warm gas is as high as previously determined for the gaseous regions associated with the star forming objects, then it must be surrounded by at least two super - thermal clouds of high molecular gas density. using the orientation of wyrowski s source c, we propose that this may be a deeply embedded herbig - haro object. even though this source is aligned with the cluster of water masers, it is possible that its source c is along the east - west axis of the synchrotron jet proposed by @xcite. based on the observed velocity of this line, we suggest that it is produced either by slow infalls or by orbital motion.
the eteapot code has been developed to make electric storage ring proton elliptical storage ring observations at the unprecedented level of @xmath0 cm. the code addresses new requirements of the proton energy einstein - podolsky - rosen ( edm ) project, such as the need to measure the non - zero energy of the fundamental particles and the requirement to track the spins. orbit and spin simulation algorithms are ported to electric lattices in which the particle speed depends on the local electric potential energy. this further restricts the list of allowable lattice elements to elements for which the bmt equation, an abbreviation for michel, bargmann, and telegdi@xcite, is exactly solvable. the fundamental re - writing of the u.s. particle physics community has recently updated its vision of the future and strategy for the next decade in a particle physics project prioritization panel ( p5 ) report. one of the new features proposed for an edm experiment is the use of electric elements for the tracking of particles. unlike in magnets, particle speeds are not constant in electric elements. thus one is accustomed to treating energy as constant for times short compared to the synchrotron period. furthermore the bremsstrahlung anderson ( bmt ) equations form the fundamental equations of motion for particle orbits in an electric lattice, which can be solved exactly in idealized three - dimensional ( 3d ) bending elements. complications imposed by electric bending in such lattices seriously complicate the porting of simulation algorithms to electric rings. fortunately it is possible to meet both of these restrictions. the accompanying paper ` ` ` how to resurrect the ags - analogue ring for edm planning '' describes the practical application of the eteachot code with emphasis on details of simulation requirements. + * rsum * + * new physics for electron storage rings + * key words and phrases : * an electric ring, relativistic coulomb approximation, entanglement, bmt, degeneracy, inverse square law + * physics department, university of maryland + college park, md 20742, usa + e - mail : raghavan@umd.edu.il +
in this work, we present a possible model for the recent accelerated expansion of the universe. it is based on the idea of a higher dimensional bulk in which the universe is sitting as a hypersurface with all the matter fields, except gravity, are confined to a fifth and sixth dimension. we consider a generalized flrw metric in a @xmath0 space time, and derive the cosmological equations. up to now, an intensive amount of researches have been performed on a similar idea either via different mechanism of compactification of extra dimension or generalizing it to non compact scenarios. such as the brane models, which advocate a compactified universe with extra dimensions, or the chabrier models, that advocate a non ghost scalar field in the conformally related einstein frame. though nothing has been asserted in the literature, with respect to the origins of the matter or the energy fields, it is always stated that the matter sources of the extra space times can be viewed as a manifestation of extra dimensions. in another word, in order to have a _ non ghost - scalar _ field in that frame, the bd coupling constant must be _ positive _ or _ negative _ one for non interacting or interacting cases, respectively. as an alternative, by considering a few simplifications, we proceed to employ a generalized scalar tensor theory, which represents a fifth dimension representation of the brans dicke theory, inducing a scale factor and a fifth order potential term. we illustrate the usefulness of this model by calculating the parameters of the model as well. satisfactory agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background experiments is obtained. cosmology : theory gravitation acceleration methods : numerical
